CTC, which already holds 17.4 pct of Canadian Tire common,said it would therefore not take up any shares tendered underits offer unless they totaled at least 1.1 mln or another 32.7pct of Canadian Tire common. The Billes control 60 pct ofCanadian Tire common. It added that it extended its offer toMay 11 at a fixed price of 165.36 dlrs a share.    CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, said it expected toknow by May 11 if it would obtain approval to appeal apreviously reported Ontario court ruling upholding a regulatorydecision to block CTC's offer.    The dealers' bid was previously blocked by the OntarioSecurities Commission because the offer excluded holders ofCanadian Tire class A non-voting shares, which make up about 96pct of company equity.
