U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakersaid that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce thebudget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.    "I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good ideaand I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't thinkit's a very good idea," Baker said in an interview on CableNews Network's "Moneyline" television program.    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNPwhich is traditionally where it has been, but the FederalGovernment is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker saidspending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.    Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed byHouse Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.    "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunateapproach to take," the Treasury Secretary said. He said theUnited States has some of the most efficient capital markets inthe world and new taxes would impair efficiency.    On the international front, Baker said banks must do morelending to developing countries. He was questioned about thisafter the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of thedebt of six major money center bank holding companies, largelybecause of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.    Baker said that developing countries must adopt free marketeconomic policies such as in the United States. He said capitalflows will be required to support the needed reforms in theeconomic systems of those countries.    The money must come either through equity or debt and Bakersaid that developing nations' "investment regimes do notsupport enough equity investment, so you've got to have somedebt there."    Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said "I thinkyou're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction thisyear." Reuter&#3;
