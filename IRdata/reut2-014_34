The records in turnover set by the LondonInternational Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) in March couldbe surpassed in the coming months, Liffe Chief ExecutiveMichael Jenkins said.    Last month, Liffe saw record monthly futures volume at 1.15mln lots, and record monthly options volume at 97,700. TotalLiffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts,or 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.    Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up onthe year-ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But T-bondvolume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.    Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflectedin part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months,while the falloff in T-bonds was an indication of the relativestability of U.S. Credit markets.    Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futuressector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FT-SE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover inthem should be much higher by end 1987.    FT-SE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, anincrease of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in thesame months of 1986.    Institutions here had been slow to find out about the useof stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more,Jenkins predicted.    Commenting on the difference in popularity between giltsand bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possiblevariety of contracts so that at any given time, at least onesector would be volatile enough to attract trading. The currentsituation of U.S. Markets being steady, and U.K. Oneschangeable, might alter completely in coming months.    A further boost to Liffe's volume and attractiveness shouldcome with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added. REUTER&#3;
