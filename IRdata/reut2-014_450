Gynex Inc said that Gynex Labsand G.D. Searle, a unit of Monsanto Co &lt;MTC>, have terminatedthe distribution agreement under which Searle had exclusiverights to market Gynex's line of generic oral contraceptives.    This means that Gynex Labs, 50 pct owned by Gynex and 50pct by Watson Laboratories, will not get remuneration under thedistribution agreement beyond the 650,000 dlrs received fromSearle in February and March 1986. This has been applied to thecosts of inventories.    Searle and Gynex Labs will both bear costs involved with aproduct recall. Gynex Labs' cost is estimated at 900,000 dlrs,to be shared equally by Gynex Inc and Watson, it said.    The companies ended the agreement when it was determinedthat Searle's product line sales and marketing commitment wouldnot allow it to commit the necessary resources for the relaunchof the Gynex line of oral contraceptives, Gynex said.    After launching the first two Gynex products in earlyFebruary, Searle voluntarily recalled them in March as apreventive measure because a limited number of packages mayhave contained out of order or missing tablets.    Gynex has made changes that should prevent a recurrence ofthe problem, and is ready to reinitiate production, it said.Talks are underway with other potential distributors. Reuter&#3;
