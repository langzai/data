The composition of the SenateAgriculture Committee, in question since the death of NebraskanDemocratic Sen. Edward Zorinsky, remains in doubt.    Zorinsky's death earlier this month cut the Democrats'majority on the committee to 9-8.    Zorinsky's replacement, Republican David Karnes, has saidhe would like a seat on the panel, and Senate Republican LeaderRobert Dole (R-Kan.) is said to have thrown his support behindKarnes, who would add a Midwestern vote to the panel.    But Karnes' appointment to the committee would require atleast one Republican to step off the committee.    Aides to Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and PeteWilson (Calif.), whose spots on the panel were rumored to be injeopardy, said their bosses were categorically opposed to beingpushed off the committee.    Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told Reuters hehad rejected a suggestion that Democrats and Republicans eachadd one member to the committee.    Leahy said he would be "delighted" to have freshman Sen. JohnBreaux (D-La.) join the committee. But Breaux's appointment wasbeing resisted by Midwestern Democrats, who feel southernstates are adequately represented on the committee.    An aide to Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.) said the senator,supported by Midwestern Democrats, had not ruled out thepossibility of moving to the committee.    The inability of the two parties to settle the matter couldincrease the possibility that the Democratic majority would beleft untouched at 9-8.    The issue is expected to be resolved any day, Senate staffsaid. Reuter&#3;
