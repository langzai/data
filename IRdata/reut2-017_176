Analyst George Salem of Donaldson,Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp upgraded his recommendationon most U.S. money center banks following comments from aJapanese official that Japan plans to provide developingnations with up to 30 billion dlrs in loans.    Salem said he changed his trading recommendation fromnegative to a buy. He is still neutral to negative long term.But the Japanese assistance is a psychological boost for thestocks. He said his report focused on Citicorp &lt;CCI> , J.P.Morgan and Co &lt;JPM>, Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and BankersTrust Co &lt;BT>.    Yesterday, a U.S. state department spokesman said the loanswill help the countries import goods needed to increasedomestic production. The countries could then boost exports andearn foreign exchange, making it easier to repay loans to U.S.banks.    "This is a group of stocks that was starving for goodnews," Salem said. "I"m not declaring an end to the debtcrisis, or that problems of all the countries are now undercontrol."    Stocks in the money center bank group were generally highertoday, adding to yesterday's gains. Reuter&#3;
