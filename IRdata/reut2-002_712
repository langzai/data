The Navy last month grounded half ofits A-6E attack jets for wing inspections after a Californiaaccident but has since returned half of the grounded planes toservice, a Navy spokesman said.    Kevin Mukri said 186 of the Navy's 340 A-6E aircraft, builtby Grumman Corp, were grounded on Feb. 20 after a Jan. 14 A-6Ecrash during a training flight near El Centro, Calif., whichkilled one of two crewmen aboard.    "A subsequent inspection of the wreckage at the NavalResearch Laboratory in Washington showed an apparent inner wingstress problem," Mukri told Reuters.    "Ninety-seven of the grounded planes have since undergonevisual inspections and 91 of those have been cleared to returnto service," he said. Reuter&#3;
