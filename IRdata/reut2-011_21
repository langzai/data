Newmont Mining Corp will seekfavorable terms for sale of its South African investments, theproxy statement for its annual meeting said.    Recommending that shareholders vote against a proposalcalling expeditious withdrawal from South Africa, the proxysaid "a quick sale could be akin to abandonment" because of thedepressed state of metal mining stocks and exchange rates oncapital withdrawals from South Africa.    The proxy said the company gave close consideration toalternatives to the continued holdings of four existing SouthAfrican metal mining investments during the past year.    Pointing out "a measurable number of investors incline tosupport" resolutions calling for South African divestment aspart of their effort to avoid pressure to sell a given stock,the company said "this largely unspoken agenda of manysupporters of disinvestment does receive attention by thecorporation."    Because of this, Newmont Mining said it "is prepared toconsider, and will seek, favorable terms for sale of its SouthAfrican investments," but asked stockholders to reject theresolution calling for withdrawal and leave the matter to thecontinuing judgment of management.
