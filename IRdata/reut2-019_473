The major benefits of BHP SteelInternational Group's big capital expenditure program shouldbegin to be seen in its 1988 financial year ending next May 31,Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> officials said.    A decline in BHP Steel's net profit to 200.02 mln dlrs inthe 1987 year ended May 31, 1987, from 253.87 mln the yearbefore, contributed to the drop in attributable group earningsto 820.27 mln dlrs from 988.20 mln.    "We look forward to a 1988 year of consolidation whilecontinuing our strong business development initiatives," BHPSteel chief executive officer David Rice told reporters.    Rice said BHP Steel's capital spending in 1987 totalled 701mln dlrs, and that total expenditure would be about 1.4 billiondlrs by the time the government's five-year Steel Industry Planexpires at the end of calendar 1988.    He said the investment program, aimed at making BHP Steelboth technically and commercially competitive on a world scale,was now over its peak and would begin to scale down.    Operational and commissioning problems flowing from theinvestment program, combined with the highest levels ofindustrial action since the steel plan started, had contributedto the decline in 1987 earnings, he said.    Rice said the industrial and production problems forced BHPSteel to import 280,000 tonnes of steel in its 1987 financialyear to keep faith with customers.    The new items of plant are now past their initial teethingproblems and talks have intensified with the unions on theindustrial troubles, he said.    Despite the profit drop in the 1987 year, BHP SteelInternational group was one of the most profitable steelproducers in the world on an after-tax basis, he said.    Its capacity utilisation was far higher, at 89 pct, thanthe current western world average of 69 pct, he added. REUTER&#3;
