&lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects toreport improved results in future earnings periods.    "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, anda solid capital position...combined with the restraint ofnon-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in theperiods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarterended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a yearago.    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue tosubstantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank'sinternational operations remains weak, reflectingresource-related difficulties of private and public sectorborrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital marketactivities.    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago whileearnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrsfrom 42 mln dlrs last year.    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interestincome declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenuesfrom international investment banking as well as a significantloss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs lastyear. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retaildeposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue butlower securities commissions from international investment bankoperations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth inconsumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. Reuter&#3;
