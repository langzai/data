The dollar opened easier after markets inthe Far East had sold it down for yen, defeating new attemptsby the Bank of Japan to check the yen's rise through sustainedcurrency intervention, dealers said.    But trading was slow and uninsipired and although dollarsentiment remained bearish, especially against the yen, dealersexpected no major movements ahead of tomorrow's Group of Sevenfinance ministers' meeting.    Sterling remained well bid as two new opinion polls showedthat the ruling Conservative party had increased its stronglead, increasing the chances of an early election, they said.    The dollar opened at 145.05/15 yen compared with 146.00/10at yesterday's European close. It closed at 145.25 yen in Tokyoafter New York's 145.85/90.    The dollar opened at 1.8195/8205 marks after yesterday'sclose in Europe of 1.8245/55. It closed at 1.8205/15 in Tokyoafter finishing at 1.8260/70 in New York.    Sterling opened marginally weaker on its trade-weightedindex, dropping one basis point to 72.3. But it started firmerat 1.6213/23 dlrs against 1.6163/73 last night. It was alsofirmer against the mark.    The pound opened at 2.9540/9575 marks against 2.9490/9530in Europe last night. But it lost some ground shortly after theopening, trading quietly around 2.95 marks.    Dealers said that with uncertainty still surrounding thedollar, yen and mark, sterling looks strong and attractive ondue to an apparent surge of support for the ruling Conservativeparty, relatively high interest rates and a strong economy.    One opinion poll today showed the Conservatives had a13-point lead over the opposition Labour party and a 17-pointlead over the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance. Anotherforecast a 92 seat Conservative majority in a new parliament.    One dealer reported a large sterling buying order from aJapanese institution earlier today.    But dealers were cautious to push sterling much higher amidwariness of intervention by the Bank of England. The bank wasthought to have intervened repeatedly yesterday but it was notsighted in the market today, dealers said.    On the dollar, dealers said all eyes were turned toWashington where finance ministers and central bank governorsof the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will meettomorrow to review their February 22 Paris currencystabilisation pact.    Few expect the meeting to produce more than a vaguelyworded confirmation of the Paris goals of currency stabilityand increased economic cooperation.    This outcome would almost certainly lead to renewed dollarweakness, especially against the yen, with levels around 140yen well within reach, some dealers said.    "But you never know. Perhaps the Japanese do come up withsome sort of stimulation package that would satisfy the marketafter all," a dealer with a U.S. Bank said. He noted news thatJapan was working out a reflationary supplementary 1987 budget.    A senior official of the Japanese ruling Liberal DemocraticParty said earlier today the party has drawn up the outline ofa reflationary economic package including a 5,000 billion yensupplementary budget for fiscal 1987.    The dollar opened at 1.5130/40 Swiss francs against1.5180/90 in Europe. It opened at 6.0525/75 French francs, downfrom its European close of 6.0660/0710. REUTER&#3;
