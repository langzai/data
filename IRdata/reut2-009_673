The rebates granted at yesterday's ECsugar tender represent a further concession to producers'complaints that they are losing money on exports outside thebloc, trade sources said.    They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currencyUnits (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producersclaim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offeredfor sales into intervention.    The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of thelevel producers thought necessary and that of the previous weekwas 2.5 Ecus below this level.    But the sources said producers who have offered a total of854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparentattempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximumrebates have given no formal indication to the Commission thatthey intend to withdraw these offers.    The French and German operators involved would be able towithdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when thesugar will officially enter intervention stores.    The five-week period is the normal delay between sugargoing into intervention and payment being made for it.    EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buythe sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a movewhich could drive down market prices further. REUTER&#3;
