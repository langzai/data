Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp said itfiled a petition asking the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commissionto reconsider its earlier rejection of the merger of theholding company's railroad assets.    The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe andSouthern Pacific Railroads on the grounds that it would reducecompetition.    Santa Fe in its petition outlines an array ofpro-competitive agreements with other railroads which wouldpreserve the economic benefits of the merger for the mergedrailroad and the public.    If the commission agrees that public benefits andcompetitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen themerger case. Interested parties have until March 25 to filestatements in response to the supplemental petition. Reuter&#3;
