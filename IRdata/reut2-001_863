"In money terms (the deficit has been reduced) from the 9.6billion dlrs that we inherited ... Down to about 3.6 billion,it may turn out at four billion dlrs," Hawke said.    In a separate interview Keating said: "The deficit for thisyear, projected, was 3.5 billion .... It is in fact running ...Over four billion and we will be trying to bring that in closeto target."
