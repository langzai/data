President Reagan signed a billlimiting fees that may be charged by the Government NationalMortgage Association (GNMA) for its guarantees of privatelyissued mortgage-backed securities but voiced seriousreservations about the measure.    He said the bill's provision barring GNMA from increasingits current fee of .06 pct charged to issuers of single-familymortgage backed securities "is an unnecessary and riskycongressional intrusion into GNMA's ability to respond quicklyand flexibly to changes in financial markets."    Reagan said his reservations "must be addressed promptlythrough remedial amendments."    Reagan said the provision hampered GNMA's ability tomaintain reserves necessary to meet its obligations,"particularly in light of a disturbing increase in claims and inGNMA's contingent liabilities."    Reagan said the legislative cap on fees "could well callinto question the adequacy of GNMA's  current reserve of 1.4billion dlrs, given the 250 billion in GNMA-guaranteedsecurities presently outstanding and GNMA's monthly contingentliability of three billion dlrs."    Reagan said he had instructed Housing Secretary SamuelPierce to work with Congress to draft revisions to thelegislation. Reuter&#3;
