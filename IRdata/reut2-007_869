An investment group led byAudio/Video Affiliates Inc said it raised its tender offer toacquire Cyclops Corp to 92.50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs ashare.    The group, Cyacq Acquisition Corp, also said it extendedthe offer until April three, from March 20.    The group said it added several conditions to its offer,including receipt of all non-public information about Cyclopsthat was provided to &lt;Dixons Group PLC> in connection withDixon's competing tender offer for Cyclops.    Cyacq's sweetened offer, totaling about 398 mln dlrs, topsDixon's offer of 92.25 dlrs a share, or about 388 mln dlrs.    On Wednesday Dixon said it had bought 54 pct of Cyclops'4.3 mln shares outstanding, boosting its stake in the companyto 56 pct.    Earlier today, however, the Securities and ExchangeCommisssion ordered Dixons to extended its tender offer untilMarch 24.    Cyacq said it hopes Cyclops shareholders "will withdrawpreviously tendered shares from Dixons' tender offer to takeadvantage of Cyacq's higher offer."    The SEC's order came after Cyacq filed suit to block Dixonsfrom taking control of Cyclops and to force an extension ofDixons' tender offer.    A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no immediatecomment on the sweetened bid from Cyacq.    Cyacq said its new offer is also subject to Cyclopsrescinding any agreements with Dixons under which theU.K.-based firm would receive "break-up fees" or expenses fromCyclops or could buy Cyclops common stock from thePittsburgh-based company.
