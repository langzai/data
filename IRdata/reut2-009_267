The Bundesbank bought large amountsof dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollarabove 149 yen, dealers said.    The dollar intervention was in concert with some othercentral banks, they said.    Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of Englandsupported the dollar against the yen earlier today and thatthese two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also activeyesterday.    The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks.    Dealers said the intervention underlined the determinationof central banks to keep currencies within recent rangesfollowing last month's agreement in Paris by six leadingcountries to foster currency stability.    One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with theBundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buydollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves.    He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing thesituation to see if it should intervene in consultation withother central banks.    Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar haduntil yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to testcentral banks' resolve to defend currency stability.    But the test came this week with the dollar falling below1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade disputebetween Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that thedollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S.Trade deficit were behind the weakness.    This week's intervention showed central banks were preparedto cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said.    Dealers said it was significant the West German and Britishcentral banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.    That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation bycentral banks to foster currency stability, they said.    But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arrangedand how frequent consultations between central banks were. REUTER&#3;
