Cuban president Fidel Castro told aCongress of the Union of Young Communists here that theproduction of crude sugar during the harvest still in progressis 800,000 tonnes behind schedule.    In a speech Sunday, published in today's official paperGRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriouslyinterrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in thecentral and western parts of the island.    The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvestersscheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year wereparticularly "vulnerable," as muddy fields prevent operations.    Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figuresto estimate tonnes of crude production during the presentharvest or the goals for the sugar campaign.    However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that thecountry will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvestwas 8.2 mln tonnes.    The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to thepresent shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, theofficial said. Reuter&#3;
