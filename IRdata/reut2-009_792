Libyan troops are hastily evacuatingtheir last important stronghold in northern Chad, leaving thekey desert oasis undefended against advancing Chad governmenttroops, military and diplomatic sources said.    They said a Libyan force of some 3,000 men was abandoningthe oasis of Faya-Largeau but added that severe sand stormsacross Chad could be delaying the pull out and an expectedgovernment strike on the town.    Swirling clouds of sand, which have closed the capital ofN'Djamena to commercial flights for two days, have sharplyreduced visibility and made it difficult to determine the exactsituation around Faya, French military officials said.    The hurried Libyan evacuation, which started yesterdaymorning, follows the capture on Sunday of Libya's best-defendedand vitally important air base at Ouadi Doum, 145 kms (90miles) northeast of Faya.    The fall of Ouadi Doum, which Chad said cost 1,269 Libyanlives, deprived Libya of its only hard surface runway in Chadcapable of taking Soviet-made bombers and transport planes andleft Faya-Largeau isolated and encircled by government troops.    Libyan forces are reported to have blown up stocks of fueland ammunition on Tuesday night before starting to fleenorthwards towards the Tibesti mountain region, which adjoinsLibya's southern border.
