U.S. military forces in the MideastGulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels andoccasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to"non-belligerent" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.    "No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protectingall shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims saidas the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase theprotective U.S. military presence in the gulf.    Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense SecretaryCaspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutralshipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.    "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels areunder our protection with the exception, on a limitedcase-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign MilitarySales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in theregion," Sims said.    U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaitiship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain andKuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances thatthe the arms would not be used elsewhere.    He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over toU.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by theU.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iraniancharges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.    Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.    Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up itsseven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additionalships and air cover are under consideration. Reuter&#3;
