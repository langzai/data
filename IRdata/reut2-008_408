Iraq said today its warplnes hadattacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed tokeep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.    The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installationsbroke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.    It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdadhailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranianyear which ended on Saturday.    A high command communique said warplanes hit the westernjetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon andstruck a supertanker nearby at the same time.    The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August1985, was last raided in January.    The communique did not identify the supertanker, but saidcolumns of smoke were seen billowing from it.    In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iraniantanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlierGulf attack.    But there has been no independent confirmation of today'ssupertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported byBaghdad in the past 24 hours.    The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight,when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.    Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields atNowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.    The three oilfields have been raided several times in thepast three years. Oil sources said they were not cruciallyimportant to Iran's oil export trade.    A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanesflew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the warfront.    It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units andseveral Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oilterminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.    Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with theiroccupants and the others fled, it said. Reuter&#3;
