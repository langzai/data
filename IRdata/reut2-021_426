South Africa must drive down itsinflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a furtherdecline in the rand, said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economicreview.    The bank said that without a major drop in the inflationrate, the rand was bound to eventually decrease even more,regardless of a sharp rise in the gold price.    Inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct andthe rand is around 49.53 U.S. Cents. Most economists estimatecontinued high inflation.    Volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady forthe rest of 1987 and then ease slightly next year. REUTER&#3;
