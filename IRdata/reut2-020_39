East and West on Monday decided to goahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed aspossibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy, theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.    Representatives of the U.S., The Soviet Union, the EuropeanCommunity and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionarythermonuclear reactor, to produce energy not from splittingatoms as in today's nuclear plants, but by joining them.    Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for PlasmaPhysics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich, West Germany,and is scheduled for completion by 1990, an IAEA statementsaid.    Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has beenunder way for many years but the project approved on Monday,known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor(ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built.    The project represents an unprecedented display ofEast-West scientific cooperation, but a decision will not bemade until its completion on whether an actual reactor would bejointly constructed or by individual participant countries.    Dieter Sigmar, a leading U.S. Fusion researcher, said lastmonth that the development of a demonstration plant would costseveral billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years.    Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste.    While today's nuclear power plants need uranium, mined inonly a few countries and producing dangerous waste, fusionplants would eventually run only on deuterium, an elementrelated to hydrogen and available from almost limitlesssupplies of sea water, according to experts.
