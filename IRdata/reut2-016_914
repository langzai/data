U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodelsaid there was a one in five chance that new drilling in Alaskawould find oil.    "But if it's there, there's a very good chance that it wouldbe a giant field," Hodel said on ABC's "Good Morning America."    "So it is the best geological prospect that they(geologists) have talked to me about since I've been involvedin this process," he said.    Hodel announced yesterday that he would urge Congress toopen up 1.5 mln acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge inAlaska to oil exploration despite fears of environmental damagethreatening the Caribou herd in the region.    He said today the exploration was needed in an effort toprevent future U.S. oil shortages and said oil drilling in thelarge Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska proved oil could be drilledwithout severely damaging the environment.    He said the Caribou herd at Prudhoe Bay had tripled,contrary to concerns before the drilling operation that itwould endanger the herd. Reuter&#3;
