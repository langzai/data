Highveld Steel and Vanadium CorpLtd said it expects 1987 earnings will be lower than lastyear's previously reported 85 cts a share.    But profits "will be at a satisfactory level," the companysaid in the annual report without giving a specific estimate.    Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will beoffset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for itsexports as the year progresses.    Highveld said measures taken last year by the EuropeanEconomic Community and the United States prohibiting all SouthAfrican steel products "presents a challenge to management toplace the steel in other areas."    The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987is expected to be similar to last year although China's role isstill an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation.    "World vanadium production capacity is still believed to beadequate to cater for any foreseeable demand," it added. REUTER&#3;
