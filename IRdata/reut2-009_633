Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumitasaid a further yen rise would have adverse effects on theJapanese economy.    He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan willcontinue to take adequate measures, including marketintervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, inclose cooperation with other major industrialized nations. Hesaid the current instability of exchange rates will not last.    Six major nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, theU.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to acttogether to hold currencies stable.    Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursueadequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economicand financial developments in and outside Japan.    He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditionshad already been sufficiently eased.    To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take avery cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easycredit conditions, he said.    He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct shouldstabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand.    Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen, Sumitareiterated he cannot find any specific reason for thecurrency's weakness.    The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reactingto overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension,he said.    Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may graduallyrecover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year endingApril 1, 1988, provided exchange rates stabilize. REUTER&#3;
