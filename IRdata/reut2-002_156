Commerce Dept. undersecretary ofeconomic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollarat  current levels was fairly priced against most Europeancurrencies.    In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-ImportBank, Ortner, the bank's senior economist also said he believedthat the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct.    "I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this pointagainst the yen," he said.    On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that "the yenis still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10or 15 pct."    In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally,said he thought that the dollar against most Europeancurrencies was "fairly priced."    Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange ratevalues was based on such economic particulars as wage ratedifferentiations.    Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. tradedeficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of thePlaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that thefirst 15 pct decline had little impact.    He said there were indications now that the trade deficitwas beginning to level off.    Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that itwould be almost impossible for those countries to earn enoughforeign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  He saidthe best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlinedin Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative. Reuter&#3;
