A U.S. appeals court threw out a twomln dlr libel award against The Washington Post for an articlethat said former Mobil Corp president William Tavoulareas setup his son in a shipping firm that did business with Mobil.    The article said Tavoulareas had used his influence to setup his son, Peter, in 1974 as a partner in the London-basedAtlas Maritime Co, a shipping company whose business included amulti-million dollar contract with Mobil.    "We are convinced that ... the 'set up' allegation wassubstantially true," the appeals court said in the 7-1 ruling.    The Tavoulareases said the 1979 article by the Post'sinvestigative reporter, Patrick Tyler, was false and that itembarrassed them and held them up to ridicule. Reuter&#3;
