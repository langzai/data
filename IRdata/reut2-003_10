An existing New York Stock Exchange,NYSE, rule might be used to limit the trading activities of itsmembers in London in stocks listed on both exchanges, sourcesat the London Exchange said.    This could arise if the London Stock Exchange goes aheadwith plans to close its trading floor.    The London Exchange sources were commenting on pressreports that the NYSE would bar its members firms from tradingon the London Exchange in interlisted stocks during periodswhen the NYSE was open.    The London exchange is seeking clarification.    London Exchange sources said the possibility ofrestrictions on NYSE members appears to reflect a rule whichrequires that exchanges recognised by the NYSE possess atrading floor.    Last month, the London Exchange said in a statement that itplanned to close its floor in due course, apart from a floorfor traded options, because almost all business is now beingdone by screen and telephone between brokerage offices.    This development stemmed from the Big Bang restructuring ofthe market on October 27. The demise of the traditional StockExchange floor has been widely expected, though no date hasbeen set as yet.    Market sources said a compromise over the NYSE rule couldwell be reached, partly because the interests of U.S.Securities dealers are not all identical.    Some of them could well start lobbying the NYSE, pointingout, among other things, that the expansion of global tradingneeds to be based on reciprocal arrangements.    NYSE brokerage firms which also trade on the LondonExchange would presumably be put at a disadvantage overnon-NYSE U.S. Firms, which  have affiliates on the LondonExchange, market sources said.
