The International TelecommunicationsUnion, which regulates communications worldwide, decided at theend of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems tobe linked with satellites, telecommunications officials said.    Until now, car phones have been linked with land stationsand have been limited mainly to urban areas. The new rulingwill make it easier for calls to be made from remote regions.    The meeting, which finished over the weekend, also decidedto allow a "radio determination satellite system," which wouldenable fleet owners to trace to within about 15 metres themovements of their lorries or cars or ships around the world.
