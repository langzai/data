Zenith Laboratories Inc saidit received Food and Drug Administration approval to marketCephalexin, an antibiotic that is the generic version of EliLilly Inc's &lt;LLY> Keflex.    Generic drugs are low-cost copies of brand name drugs thathave lost their patents. Keflex's patent expires April 21.Analysts said four generic drug companies, including Zenith,will have approval to market generic Keflex this year.    Analysts said Keflex is Lilly's second leading drugproduct, with 1986 worldwide sales of about 335 mln dlrs. In1986 Lilly had sales of 3.7 billion dlrs.    "We think that in the first year that it loses its patent,U.S. sales of Keflex will drop to about 240 mln dlrs from 280mln dlrs," said Joe Riccardo, associate director of BearStearns.    Riccardo said Lilly would offset the loss with sales fromHumatrope, a genetically engineered human growth hormonerecently approved for marketing in the U.S.    He also said it was likely that Lilly would get U.S. FDAmarketing approval this year for Prozac, a drug for treatingclinical depression that also shows promise in weightreduction.
