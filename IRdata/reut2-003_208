Vneshtorgbank, the Soviet Foreign Tradebank, is seeking an increase to 250 mln stg from the original150 mln for a five year, sterling bankers' acceptance facilityarranged last autumn, Lloyds Merchant Bank Ltd said asarranger.    The facility has a 10 basis point facility fee and there isa 15 basis point maximum cap on the margin.    Banking sources said syndication for the increase wasproceeding very well so far, although the syndication would notnecessarily be confined to banks participating in the originalgroup.    Banking sources said that one reason for the increase wasthat Vneshtorgbank had been very impressed by the relativelylow cost of financing by means of eligible bills, rather thanthrough more traditional instruments priced in relation toLondon Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).    The facility is Vneshtorgbank's first eversterling-denominated bankers' acceptance facility.    Banking sources noted that Vneshtorgbank now has twofacilities in the market, since First Chicago Ltd was awarded amandate last week to arrange a 200 mln dlr, eight year loan at1/8 point over LIBOR.
