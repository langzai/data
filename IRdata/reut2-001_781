The failure of talks to introducenew coffee export quotas within the International CoffeeAgreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazilhaving a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, Presidentof the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmonsaid.    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptableas the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.    "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"Calmon added.    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mlnbags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.    "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this wasbetter than such a quota reduction," he added.    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and greencoffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severedrought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under10 mln bags.    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, ofwhich 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvestthis year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for lastyear's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believeit was higher than this. Reuter&#3;
