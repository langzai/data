West Germany's current accountsurplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in Februaryfrom a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, aspokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.    The Statistics Office had originally put the Januarycurrent account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.    The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billionmark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the currentaccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplusrecorded in February 1986.    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of theFebruary current account surplus compared with January was dueto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current accountfigures are seasonally adjusted.    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pctcompared with January.    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculatethe real change in exports and imports in February. But forcomparison purposes it noted that in January the average valueof imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the averagevalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.    Within the current account, the services account had 300mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln marksurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion markdeficit.    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports invalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with ayear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks forJanuary/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1billion marks in the year-ago period.    The cumulative current account surplus for January andFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billionmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplusreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well asseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlierthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct againstJanuary while export prices were unchanged.    "The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trendthat is not expected to change for several months at least,"said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said thesurplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) inFrankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave amore accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January andFebruary together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplusposted in November and December.    "The trend is clearly lower," he said.    This economist, who declined to be named, said the Februaryrise was also partly explained by special factors in January,when there had been a number of public holidays as well asextremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.
