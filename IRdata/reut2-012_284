Japan appears to be relying less oncorn from China, Argentina and South Africa and more onsupplies from the United States, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment said.    In its World Production and Trade report, the departmentsaid in the past seven weeks reported U.S. corn sales of nearlythree mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the levelduring this period last year.    Reports of short Argentine supplies and the apparentunwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world pricesmay have caused Japanese buyers to turn to the United Statesfor corn supplies, the department said.
