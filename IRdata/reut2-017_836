Western bickering over food surpluses isobscuring the fact that starvation is now a bigger problem thanever before, a senior World Food Council official said.    Alain Vidal Naquet, head of external relations for thecouncil, told a news conference that a meeting organised by theUnited Nations body in Peking next week would try to forcegovernments to take a more serious attitude to the food crisis.    "The world is facing two crises -- poverty in developingcountries and paradoxically an overflow of food surpluses inthe northern part of the world," Naquet said.    "This is affecting dangerously the balance of theinternational economy," Naquet said.    He said it was ironic that the leaders of the western worldwould discuss food over-production during the summit in Venicenext week at the same time as the Peking meeting would bediscussing food shortages.    "Hunger is not a problem kept in mind by governments. Theurgency of the problem is hidden by the (food surplus andtrade) problems of the rich countries," he said. "There are morepeople today in the world lacking enough food than there werein 1974 (the year of the World Food Conference in Rome)."     Progress has been made in some parts of the world,especially Asia, but Naquet said that increasing foodproduction and aid from the developed world were not inthemselves the answer to the world food problem.    He said developing countries should not rely entirely onaid from developed countries and should increase cooperationamongst themselves to increase local food production andimprove distribution of existing food stocks.    More than 30 government ministers are expected to attendthe Peking meeting, including delegations from Third Worldcountries, the U.S., The Soviet Union and Europe. REUTER&#3;
