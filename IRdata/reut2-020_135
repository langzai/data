The United States and India havenot yet agreed on a food aid package to help thedrought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said.    Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countrieshave been discussing a package but that he did not expect thespecifics of the offer to be announced during Indian PrimeMinister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.    "We have been talking about the potential needs that Indiamight have for both their commercial market and purchases needsas well as the possibilities of assistance," Lyng said.    "At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. Theamounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we haveindicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist inwhatever way they deem most valuable," he said.    There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA wouldoffer India subsidized vegetable oil under the exportenhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419of an amended 1949 law.    Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agreeon the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and thatWashington would prefer the package include something otherthan donated food.    "The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking careof themselves. India is a country that has come a long way inits ability to produce food and they have a great pride inthat," Lyng said.    "We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses westill have of many commodities..., would like to share in theimport business the Indians do, and then we have some, as wealways do, compassion for the people of India and would like tocooperate with them," he said.    Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officialsduring Gandhi's visit here, adding, "I just don't know ofanything that might be announced specifically."    Asked if "the ball was in the Indians' court," he said, "Yes."    Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening. Reuter&#3;
