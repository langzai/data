Honda Motor Co Ltd &lt;HMC.T> said itshifted production of motorcycles with engine capacity of 700cc and bigger for sale in the U.S. To its wholly ownedsubsidiary &lt;Honda Motor of America Inc> in Ohio, partly due tothe yen's appreciation against the dollar.    A parent company spokesman said the Ohio plant, which makes360,000 cars a year, is now also producing 1,100 cc and 1,200cc motorcycles, partly for export.    Motorcycle output in Ohio totalled 28,000 in 1986, down 33pct from a year earlier, but the shift in production will raiseproduction to 44,000 in 1987, the spokesman said.    The move to the U.S. Of large motorcycle manufacturing wasalso due partly to higher U.S. Tariffs for imported motorcylesbigger than 700 cc, industry sources said.    The U.S. Imposed tariffs on imports of large motorcyclesfrom April 1983, starting at 49.9 pct and gradually falling, tohelp the U.S. Motorcycle manufacturing industry to reconstruct,the sources said. The tariff for U.S. Fiscal year 1987/88 isset at 14.5 pct.    They said the U.S. Planned to cut the tariff to 4.4 pct forfiscal 1988/89, but that the higher level is likely to be keptfor a few years due to the slow pace of reconstruction. REUTER&#3;
