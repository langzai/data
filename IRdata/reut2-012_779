West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris inFebruary had been successful and would be continued.    Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week'sInternational Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: "The ...Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels hasproven its worth and will also determine future developments."    Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what hewould consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollararound 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports.    He said studies by international organisations had made itclear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major effortsremained necessary to support adjustments in foreign tradebalances via necessary corrections to economic policy.    "No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, theU.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strongunder-valuation," he said.    Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in aswift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning thecurrent trade dispute over semi-conductors.    Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Pariscurrency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically butnoted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had notbeen published.    The Paris declaration did not state the levels at whichcentral banks of the major industrialised countries wouldintervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefullyconsidered. He said he had nothing further to add. Reuter&#3;
