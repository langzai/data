Analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc saythe outlook for stock markets worldwide is postivie, althoughtotal returns in the U.S. stock market are not expected toexceed 10 pct over the next 12 months.    The report by Robert Salomon Jr and Caroline Davenport saidthat after a strong first quarter, which saw U.S. stock marketindices rise more than 20 pct, the direction of the market isstill upward because slower economic growth will stretch outthe recovery period. The firm expects profits for companies inthe Standard and Poor's 500 stock index to rise 17 pct in 1987and 18 pct in 1988.     The bullish global outlook is underpinned by continued butsubdued economic growth, fiscal restraint, good liquidity andincreasing profits, Salomon said.    The Salomon analysts say potential risks which must bemonitored include any shift toward protectionism and foreignbuying of U.S. stocks particularly by the Japanese. "A sharprun-up in stock prices in secondary stocks" would be a warningsign, as would a big increase in enthusiasm for the initialpublic offering market," Salomon said.    Salomon said global diversification of equity markets hasreached a new peak. Reuter&#3;
