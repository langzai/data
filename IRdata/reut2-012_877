The U.S. Agriculture Department saidan announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mlndlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S.commodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies.    First, the USDA said its announcement should not have saidthat plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs inGSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber.    The original announcement said the guarantees includedthree mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood.    Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters hedid not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales,but that "it's possible it would be."    Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be amanufactured product. Members states of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offerconcessional credits on manufactured products, Sims said.    However, the Reagan administration is considering whetherto allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guaranteeprogram, Sims said.    Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of apreviously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102was available for both public and private sector importers.    In fact, the line of credit guarantees for tallow isavailable only for public sector importers, Walter Stern,Foreign Agricultural Service Turkey analyst, said. Reuter&#3;
