South Korea's purchase of about 2.4mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close todouble last year's total -- indicates that imports from theUnited States, as well as total imports are set for a dramaticjump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its World Production and Trade Report, the departmentsaid total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season(Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mlntonnes from the United States.    During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mlntonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.    Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn inlight of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies fromChina, Argentina and South Africa, it said. Reuter&#3;
