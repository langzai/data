The Zeebrugge ferry disaster, in whicharound 200 people drowned seven weeks ago, was almost certainlycaused by the ship leaving port with its bow doors wide open, aBritish government inquiry was told.    Lawyer David Steel, representing the government, told theopening session of a public inquiry into the March 6 tragedythat this was "the only tenable explanation."    The ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, is owned byTownsend Thoresen, part of P and O's &lt;PORL.L> subsidiaryEuropean Ferries Group.    Steel, commissioner of wrecks for England and Wales, saidthe inquiry would probably conclude that the ferry capsized incalm seas and fair weather a mile outside the Belgian port whenwater poured into the car deck.    "We think you will also conclude that the immediate cause ofthat was that the doors were open, he said.    Steel told the tribunal it appeared no attempt was made toclose either the inner or outer bow doors prior to what shouldhave been a routine voyage to the English port of Dover,despite a provision in the ship's "Stability Booklet" that thedoors were to be closed and kept closed.
