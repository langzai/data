President Reagan set theExport-Import Bank's direct loan ceiling in fiscal year 1987 at800 mln dlrs, a decrease of 100 mln dlrs.    In a letter to Congress, Reagan also said he was notseeking any additional legislation to rescind any authority ofthe bank, which aids U.S. exports.    Reagan said he had concluded that the statutory 1987 limitfor Eximbank loan guarantee commitments should not be changed,noting that "continued growth in the U.S. economy and globalrecovery could create unexpected demand for guarantees andinsurance."
