The Finance Ministry would raise lendinglimits on local non-life insurance firms to meet the increasingneed for efficient fund management, a ministry spokesman said.    He said the allowable non-collateral lending limits wouldbe increased to 30 pct of each insurer's total assets from 25pct and that overseas subsidiaries will be made eligible asborrowers.    The lending limit for non-life insurers which do notsatisfy criteria for making non-collateral loans would beexpanded to three pct of total assets from one pct.    The upper limit of lending of securities by non-lifeinsurance companies, now set at five pct of each insurer'stotal assets would be abolished, the official said.    This will enable such lending by non-life insurers to beincluded in the separate category of money lending, which islimited to 55 pct of the total assets of each insurer.    Approvals for the changes, which must be given to eachinsurer on application, were expected to begin soon, possiblyas early as next week. REUTER&#3;
