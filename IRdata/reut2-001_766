Dome Petroleum Ltd's plan to rescheduledebt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs will likely bedetailed to a group of 56 major creditors on Monday or Tuesdaynext week, a company spokesman said.    Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company'sdebt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting fromdiscussions with Dome's lenders, spokesman David Annesley toldReuters in response to an inquiry.    Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30, 1987, when it hopes toimplement the debt plan now under negotiation.    Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statementoutlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal followingrelease of the plan to lenders.    Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debtplan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principlefrom creditors prior to June 30.    The group of major lenders have agreed to defer asubstantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under aninterim agreement that links payments to secured lenders withcash flow generated by assets backing the loans.    Annesley also said there was no change in the status oflegal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who areseeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt.    Together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 Swissfrancs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swissfranc denominated debt in default.    Annesley said the company's next scheduled appearance in aSwiss court to defend against the actions is set for March 16.    Dome Petroleum's 1986 fourth quarter and year earnings willlikely be reported at the end of March, he also said. Reuter&#3;
