Wall Street traders said the stock ofOutboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cabletelevision program that Outboard is a likely takeover target ofSun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL>.    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8to 31-1/2 Tuesday.    A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to gofor control of the whole company.    An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on therumor.    The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for upto 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.    A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights planthat will be triggered when a person or group acquiresbeneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or beginsa tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategicplanning, said management wants to stay independent. "We arenot trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with ourstrategic plans," he said.    That plan includes integrating five boat companies thatOutboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jonessaid all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.    An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a"decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs ashare is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is inregistration for a two mln common share offering with MorganStanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemicalto strike before the offering is underway. Reuter&#3;
