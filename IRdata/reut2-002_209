Securities and Exchange CommissionChairman John Shad said the SEC favors shortening the current10-day period for disclosing takeover attempts but opposesputting restrictions on the use of so-called junk bonds.    "We favor shortening the disclosure period to two days,"Shad told members of the House Telecommunications and Financesubcommittee when asked for his recommendation.    He said the SEC's responsibility was to provide fulldisclosure for securities, including junk bonds, and not tomake decisions based on merit. He said junk bonds had somevalue because of their liquidity.    Shad said he opposes proposals to require those attemptingtakeovers to file a statement on the impact the takeover wouldhave on the communities involved.    "We've opposed it in the past. It goes far beyond investorprotection," Shad said.    He said he had no comment on a proposal by House SpeakerJim Wright, D- Texas, to tax securities transactions. Reuter&#3;
