&lt;Rainbow Corp Ltd> said &lt;BrierleyInvestments Ltd> (BIL) is trying to disrupt Rainbow's plannedmerger with &lt;Progressive Enterprises Ltd>.    Rainbow chairman Allan Hawkins said in a statement, "In ouropinion BIL have deliberately tried to create anomalies in themarket prices of Rainbow and Progressive shares since themerger was announced."    The merger, announced in February, involves the formationof a new company, &lt;Astral Pacific Corp Ltd>, which Rainbow andProgressive shareholders will enter into on a one-for-one sharebasis. Both boards have approved the merger.    BIL has said it was the mystery bidder behind a recentstand in the market for three mln Progressive shares.    "We simply regard Progressive Enterprises shares to be worthapproximately twice as much as Rainbow shares and do not thinkthe merger, as proposed, is soundly based," BIL chief executivePaul Collins said in an interview in the weekly NationalBusiness Review newspaper published today.    Collins was not immediately available to respond directlyto Hawkins' statement.    Hawkins said the merger has been assessed by independentconsultants and declared fair in all respects, with benefits toall shareholders.    "We are not going to stand by while other parties distortthe picture for their own strategic purposes and distract themarket away from the real benefits of the merger," he said.    "In our opinion, BIL's actions are clearly not designed tobe in the long term interests of either Progressive or Rainbowshareholders," Hawkins said. Reuter&#3;
