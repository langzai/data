Active Japanese investment in U.S. realestate will continue despite a weak dollar because suchinvestments are strong hedges against inflation, financiers andreal estate industry experts said.    Addressing a conference on Japanese investment in U.S. realestate, Setsuya Tabuchi, chairman of Nomura Securities Co Ltd,said Japanese investors are extremely cautious about investingin Treasury securities because of currency losses suffered inthe past during the dollar's sharp decline.    But, he added, "Real estate is a hedge against inflation,so such investment will not decline."    Japanese total investment in U.S. real estate last year isestimated at around six billion dlrs, exceeding the fourbillion dlrs ploughed into U.S. equities, Arther Mitchell ofCoudert Brothers, a U.S. law firm, told the conference.    Adding in financing of real estate projects by Japanesebanks and leasing companies, the total aamount of Japanesefunds committed to U.S. real estate projects could reach 20billion dlrs in 1987, he said.   The dollar's fall has made U.S. property cheap, and exchangerisks are low because many Japanese firms are makinginvestments projected on a dollar/yen rate of 120-130, he said.    Panelists at the conference said Japanese are now lookingat a wider variety of real estate investments, includingdevelopment projects and suburban buildings.    Benjamin Lambert, chairman of Eastdil Realty Inc, said thesale of 50 pct of the company to Nomura last year was designedto expand its customer base to Japan through the securitieshouse's close ties with Japanese investors.    Participation in mortgage loans is becoming popular amongJapanese, panelists said. Mortgages can be made to disguiseactive purchases, and years later the loans can be convertedinto ownership of the property, they said. Reuter&#3;
