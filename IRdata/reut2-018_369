Roy Denman, the European Communityrepresentative in Washington, warned the United States againstsetting a rule that trading partners running a surplus shouldbe "beaten over the head" for not removing trade barriers.    Denman, in an Op-Ed piece in today's Washington Post, saidtrade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations,either bilaterally or multilaterally, through the Geneva-basedUnited Nations agency, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,GATT.    Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debatethis week on a major trade bill.    "It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partnersrunning a surplus with the United States should be beaten overthe head if trade barriers objected to by the United States arenot removed within a certain time-scale," said Denman in anapparent reference to some of the measures in the congressionaltrade bill.    "If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliationand counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading systemwill very quickly unravel," he said.    Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was notpurely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.    "The trade deficit results from a combination ofmacroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchangerate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,"Denman said.    He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfairtrade prctices.    He said the European Community had recently updated a listof some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.    "We did not circulate this list with any hostile oraggressive intent. We did so to set the record straight," Denmansaid. Reuter&#3;
