The proposed European Community (EC) taxon vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on theagenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, theWest German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.    Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conferencethe West German feed industry believes the EC does notseriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because itwould end in another transatlantic trade war.    "We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And theCommission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies."    American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect WayneBennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producerswere confident the tax would be rejected.    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations ona lobbying tour of EC capitals, will also visit Bonn onThursday and Friday.    There are indications the Bonn government will also rejectthe proposed tax, Wagner said. Reuter&#3;
