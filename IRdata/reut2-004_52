Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigehas asked the White House to consider blocking the plannedJapanese acquisition of a major U.S. Computer and semiconductormaker, U.S. Officials said yesterday.    The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concernson national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd&lt;SLB> unit &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd&lt;ITSU.T>. The officials said the sale could leave the UnitedStates overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment usedin advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligencegathering.    The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen thestrained relations between the two countries stemming from thehuge Japanese trade surplus.    The White House Economic Policy Council would consider thesale in the coming weeks, they said.    Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was notknown, but in the past, he has opposed the transfer of hightechnology to foreign governments or companies.    Computers made by U.S. Manufacturers are widely used in theworld, but Tokyo told U.S. Negotiators recently it preferslocal manufacturers and would not buy U.S. Supercomputers. REUTER&#3;
