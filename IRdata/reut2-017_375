Washington views with concern aplan to increase Japan's voting power at the Asian DevelopmentBank (ADB), a U.S. Delegate at the bank's annual meeting said.    Japan, which holds 15.1 pct of the ADB's capital stock, andthe U.S. Which holds 14.9 pct, currently have near-parity invoting power.    "The ADB was set up in 1966 as a partnership between theU.S. And Japan," the official said. "Any change in thatrelationship would transmit a psychological message to thisregion's countries that there is a slackening of interest onthe part of the U.S."    "We do not want any dilution of our influence in theorganisation," the U.S. Official added.    He said an imbalance in procurement contracts awarded forADB-funded projects was however improving slowly.    The U.S. Share of the contracts had grown from about sevenpct to about 12 pct in 1986, the official said, while Japan'sshare had dropped from 25 pct to 20 pct.    "We will urge more U.S. Businessmen to join in the biddingfor these projects," he said.    The official said Washington was concerned about the ADB'sfuture role in the region.    "The U.S. Believes the ADB should act as a catalyst both forpolicy changes that will lead to sustainable, long-termeconomic growth and for other financial flows," chief U.S.Delegate Charles Dallara told the meeting earlier.    "Economic reform should be a theme of the ADB's lending," theunidentified U.S. Official said.    "The bank is doing its borrowers a disservice by notentering into policy dialogue," he added.    "We are looking for the bank to take up the cudgel when itsborrowers are at a critical stage in their development. We arelooking at a 15 or 20 year horizon." REUTER&#3;
