Securities and Exchange CommissionJohn Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definitionof insider trading but thought action should wait until theSupreme Court ruled on an insider trading case.    "I'd like the benefit of the Winans decision beforedeciding on a definition," Shad told a Senate Appropriationssubcommittee hearing.    Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall StreetJournal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insidertrading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks hewas going to write about in his column.    The stocks usually went up or down in price depending onWinans' recommendation.    He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent ofthe SEC's enforcement activities last year despite thepublicity given to recent major cases.    "Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pctof the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading," Shad said.    Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to dealwith all types of securities fraud.    Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S.Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not knowwhen his successor would be named by President Reagan. Reuter&#3;
