The U.K. government hopes for abreakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policiesduring next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs MinisterMichael Howard, political sources said.    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he willtry to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from JapanesePrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help insolving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significantrole in Japan's telecommunications market, government sourcessaid.    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to armitself early with new statutory powers which it says could beused against certain Japanese financial institutions.    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter fromNakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as asignal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactoryoutcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,government officials said.    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyothat Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more thanpoliteness in the face of British anger, they added. Reuter&#3;
