The Institute for Economic Research(WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 grossdomestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pctforecast made last December.    WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he sawthe one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, asthe upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revisiondue to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.    A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oilproducing states, combined with the effects of the dollar'sfall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.    Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth thisyear. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, privateconsumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pctin 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.    Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2pct last year due to the slack economic activity.    Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficitof about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billionsurplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria'scentral bank, last month forecast the current account would beroughly in balance this year.    However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should haveno notable effect on the government's attempts to cut thebudget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, hesaid. REUTER&#3;
