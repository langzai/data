Central Bank president FranciscoGros said possible retaliation by Brazil's creditors would notbe an intelligent measure because it would affect both sides.    "If our creditors considered retaliation, Brazil would loseits capacity to export, thus would never be able to pay itsdebt," Gros said in a news conference.    Gros said that during their 12-day globe-trotting tour ofseveral countries, he and Finance Minister Dilson Funaro warnedcreditors that Brazil could no longer continue representing therole of merely an exporter of capital.    "We made it very clear to our creditors that we must findother means to pay our debt. We told them we wish to pay butthat first we must make sure that the country grows," Gros said.    "We pointed out to them that in the last two years Brazilpaid 24 billion dlrs just in interest rates, while onlyreceiving two billion dlrs in new loans over a similar period."Gros reiterated that Brazil will not accept interference fromthe International Monetary Fund (IMF), as creditors suggested.    "The performance of the IMF over the years has not beenconvenient to our needs. It is an important institution, but wedo not accept it to monitor our economy," he said.    "The banks would welcome us going to the IMF. We wouldwelcome if they pardoned half our debt," Gros said.    Brazil announced suspension of interest payment of 68billion dlrs owed to commercial foreign banks on February 20.No deadline was established for the renewal of the payment.    "Our major commitment is with the country's growth.Therefore, we need more money to invest on new projects," Grossaid.  He said that before the announcement of the suspensionof interest payment, Brazil was paying about 500 mln dlrs amonth to its commercial foreign creditors.    "We can say that at least we are saving some money," he said.    Gros said Brazil has not submitted specific proposals tocreditors, and instead hopes that proposals would come throughbilateral negotiations.    The Central Bank president said he will be going next weekto Washington to take part in a meeting of the Inter AmericanDevelopment Bank .    In Brasilia, sources linked to the Presidency said Brazilwas preparing a new program of economic readjustment tostrengthen its negotiations on its 109 billion dlr foreigndebt. The sources said the new program could be announced bythe end of the month and calls basically for preservation ofthe country's growth.                Reuter&#3;
