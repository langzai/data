Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it joined withCarrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology inaluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international autosalon.    Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheetaluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used forBertone's steel-structured sports cars.    Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested inBritain by the Motor Industry Research Association.     Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminumstructure technology so that it is suitable for modern automaking methods and plants.    Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of acar's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling andperformance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. Itsaid the structures also provide long life without the need forrust protection.    The structure provides the same stiffness and safety aspresent materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said. Reuter&#3;
