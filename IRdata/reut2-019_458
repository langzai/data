The acting governor of Saudi Arabia'sstate-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, hasretired at his own request, oil industry sources said.    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisationplanning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,left in a major oil industry shake up last December.    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold thepost permanently.    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed ZakiYamani from their posts late last year in a move which industrysources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oilmarket.    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, SaudiArabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tunedto the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led anOPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrellast December.    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operationswhich could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabiadoes business, the sources said.    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor'sjob include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, whoearlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University ofPetroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning MinisterFaisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of theUniversity of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah IslamicPort. REUTER&#3;
