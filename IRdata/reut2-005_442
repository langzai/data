Salomon Brothers Inc said it raisedits opinion on Caterpillar Inc's stock to an aggressive buyfrom a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988.    Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecastof three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.    Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.    "Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,we believe that profits could begin to improve in the secondhalf - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through1988 and 1989," he said.    Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors- higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, andimproved demand.    The higher prices will stick because its Japanesecompetitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of theincreased value of the yen, he said. Reuter&#3;
