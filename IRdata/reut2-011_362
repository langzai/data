European countriesmust cooperate closely if they want to save their electronicsindustry from dropping to a third-rate global position, NVPhilips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PLGO.AS> chairman Cor van derKlugt told a congress here.    Noting that Europe was now a net importer of IntegratedCircuits, Van der Klugt said that in information technology,the European Community had posted a trade deficit in 1984 offive billion ecus compared with a 1975 surplus of 1.7 billionecus.    Such factors were forcing European electronics companies toseek cooperation with others both inside and outside Europe.    Van der Klugt cited Western Europe's joint high-technologyresearch programme ESPRIT, sponsored by the European Community,as a useful programme for what he called "pre-competitivecooperation" with other companies in the same or related fields.    The Philips president said companies should join suchefforts in an attempt to gain a foothold in markets ofstrategic importance such as the U.S. And Japan.    Working together, firms could produce on a larger scale andmore cheaply by sharing business risks and pooling togetherdevelopment, marketing and production activities, he said.    As an example, Van der Klugt pointed to Philips'telecommunications joint venture with AT and T &lt;T.N> of theU.S. To form &lt;APT>, working on digital telephone exchangeprojects.    "Only the largest companies can recoup the billions ofdollars involved in development in this area," he said, addingthat the world market offered room for no more than seven oreight manufacturers of such products.
