The German auction system of sharestrading, retaining the business floor, can develop in parallelto off-floor computer trading introduced in London in the "BigBang," Frankfurt stock exchange president Michael Hauck said.    Hauck told a conference that it was unclear if theFrankfurt floor would become superfluous. The Frankfurtexchange did 55 pct of all German securities trading and wasinvesting 86 mln marks in renovating its building. Ascreen-delivered in-house quotation system would soon be inplace too.    The nature of the auction system limited how far tradinghours could be extended from the present two-hour session.    Other practical problems inhibited the German ability tofollow London's moves. Official brokers, who set the prices,were under the control of the Finance Ministry. This meanttransfer of securities control to an independent body, ifdesired, would need legislative changes, Hauck said.    "Shorting" stocks in Germany was also prohibited by the rulesfor pension and insurance funds. They could thus not be lentout for the kind of speculative positions taken by Londonmarket makers.    But Hauck said the system in London could be criticised forbeing too distant from those it should serve. REUTER&#3;
