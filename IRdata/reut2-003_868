Two U.S. government agencies are indispute over a proposal for U.S. firms to sell computers toIran, officials said.    The Commerce Department said it intends to approve exportlicenses for two firms to sell computers and related equipmentto the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency and the Iran PowerGeneration Transmission, spokesman B. Jay Cooper said.    The export companies were not identified, but the salesincluded computers made by Digital Equipment Co &lt;DEC> ofMaynard, Mass.    High-technology exports must be approved by the departmentsof Commerce, Defense and State.    The Pentagon will appeal Commerce's approval of the salesbecause the technology could be turned against U.S. nationalsecurity, Commander Bob Prucha, a Pentagon spokesman, said.    The Pentagon will ask the National Security Council in theWhite House to prohibit the sales.    Cooper said the State Department did not object to thesales, but Secretary of State George Shultz indicated he mayweigh in against the deal.    Under questioning by Rep. Jack Kemp (R-NY) at a hearing,Shultz said he was unaware that the Commerce Department waspreparing to grant export licenses for the sale of computers.    "I'm not in favor of sales to Iran" of advanced U.S.technology, Shultz said.    The Commerce Department has argued that excessiverestrictions hurt U.S. companies that compete with foreignexporters.    Cooper said the technology in the Iranian sales wasavailable elsewhere and that foreign companies would get theIran business if the U.S. export licenses were not approved. Reuter&#3;
