Rising water levels on the Rhine caused byheavy rain are delaying an operation near Karlsruhe to raisetwo sunken boats which have blocked the river's main navigationchannel since early last week, a Karlsruhe water authorityspokesman said.    He said two floating cranes were unable to begin liftingthe sunken tug Orinoko and its lighter because the water levelhad reached 815 centimetres and was forecast to rise to 820-830cm by tomorrow. He was unable to say when the operation mightbegin.    Meanwhile, high water at Cologne has forced vessels totravel at reduced speed, a water authority spokesman in Colognesaid. But a water authority spokesman in Duisburg, 60 kms northof Cologne, said vessels there were moving normally. Reuter&#3;
