American Telephone and Telegraph Co saidit plans to build a new computer that incorrates a unifiedversion of its UNIX System IV operating system and SunMicrosystems Inc's recently annouced SPARC micropocessor.    The SPARC chip is based on reduced instruction-setcomputing, or RISC, technology.     ATT said the version of UNIX used by the new computer willincorporate po;ular features of the Berkeley 4.2 system, adirative of the UNIX system used widely in scientific andengineering markets, as well as features of SunOs, a variant ofthe Berkely system sold by Sun.    ATT said it would take 18 months to two years to developnew computers based on the Sun microchip and the merged versionof the UNIX operating system.    Vittorio Cassoni, president of ATT's newly-formed DataSystems Group, said the company will not offer the new machinesuntil the merged version of UNIX is completed.    "It's the software that will determine the availability ofproducts based on SPARC," he said.    Eventually ATT's entire line of 3B mini computers will beconverted to the SPARC architecture, Cassoni said.       The investment of all current users will be protected,meaning that they will be able to maintain the software used onthe current 3B line, he said.    Cassoni also said ATT's sales of computers declined in thefirst nine months of the year compared with the first ninemonths of last year.    The lower sales were primarily the result of ATT'stransition to a new line of computers, he said.    However, "demand for the new products is way, way aboveexpectation," he stated. Reuter&#3;
