The United Auto Workers has set a March26 strike deadline at General Motors Corp's Pontiac, Mich.,truck and bus plant, a UAW spokesman said.    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that the 9,000UAW-represented workers at the facility will walk off the jobat noon (EST) next Thursday if an agreement is not reached bythat time.    "We will be on strike. If the workers are still in there,they will come out," the spokesman, Reginald McGhee, said.    The union earlier said it today notified GM of its intentto authorize a strike at the Pontiac facility.    The UAW gave GM what it calls a "five-day letter," whichgives the company five days to come to an agreement beforeworkers go on strike. The letter was effective at noon today.Weekend days are not included in the five-day period, McGheesaid.    The spokesman could not say what the chances were for asettlement. "At this point, it's too early to say" whether theplant will be struck, McGhee said.    The UAW earlier said the strike notification is expected to"trigger an intensive effort to resolve disputed issues."    Talks between the UAW local at the plant, Local 594, and GMofficials were continuing today over disputed contract issues,including the main issue of whether the company can subcontractjobs to non-union workers.    McGhee said the two sides are also discussing health andsafety matters and relief time. Reuter&#3;
