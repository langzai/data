Sweden's rate of inflation duringJanuary has been revised downwards after a fault was made incalculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.    The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead ofthe previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, withoutexplaining how the error arose.    Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflationrate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing forJanuary's revised figures, it added.    Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, againsta revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pctin February 1986, the bureau said.    The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a governmentimposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, thebureau added. REUTER&#3;
