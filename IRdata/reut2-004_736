The  Ministry of Mineshas announced the discovery of a major gold field in Grand Boisin Haiti's mineral-rich North.    At a press conference yesterday, a Ministry spokesmanreported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore,with each ton capable of containing 7,666 grams of gold. Thespokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find,discovered on Wednesday, was worth.    However, mining could only begin after foreign partnersinvest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment, thespokesman said.    The Haitian government has never before operated a goldmine, but the United Nations has recently completed a threeyear feasibility study which lists Grand Bois and Morne Bossaas sites of important gold deposits.    In 1971, the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives, operated by aCanadian firm, closed down after years of mining a concentratecontaining gold as well as copper.    "The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money,"said a former official of Sedren Mine.    "But like everything else there's a catch. The gold has tobe extracted, and first someone has to come up with the moneyto finance the operation," the official, who asked not to benamed, told Reuters. Reuter&#3;
