&lt;Prudential Corporation Plc>, whichearlier announced a 62 pct rise in 1986 pre-tax profits, saidit had recorded its best general insurance result for six yearsbut had not reached satisfactory levels of profit in otherareas.    Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conferencethat despite returning to trading profits, the Internationaldivision and the Mercantile and General division had notreached satisfactory levels.    But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General tradingprofits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and theInternational division.    The acquisition of the U.S. Life company &lt;Jackson National>had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt inthe 1987 results, Corby said.    The Group also intended to expand the number of its estateagency firms bought last year, and hoped they will comprisebetween 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future.    "We hope they will be very profitable very shortly. We arelooking for profits from the estate agencies themselves as wellas the insurance products associated with them," Corby said.    Prudential's pre-tax profits rose from 1985's 110.1 mln stgto 178.1 mln stg in 1986. Reuter&#3;
