The European Airbus consortium is ready tocooperate with U.S. Aerospace group McDonnell Douglas Corp onfuture aircraft programs, pointing the way to a defusion of thetransatlantic dispute on subsidies to the aircraft industry,French Transport Ministry Jacques Douffiagues said.    He told the southern French daily Depeche du Midi in aninterview today that the talks between senior U.S. And EuropeanCommunity officials in London on October 27 on the Airbusquestion should be more harmonious as a result.      Airbus officials said last week that they were continuingtalks on possible collaboration with McDonnell Doughlas onaircraft projects, including an eventual stretched version ofthe Airbus A320 short-haul jet, but that collaboration in theimmediate future was unlikely.    U.S. Manufacturers and officials have charged that theFrench, British and West German governments have disrupted theworld aviation market by unfairly subsidising Airbus, allowingit to undercut private U.S. Competitors, while the Europeanshave responded by saying that U.S. Manufacturers benefit fromlarge government-funded military contracts.    Douffiagus said that transatlantic cooperation was alreadywidespread in aircraft construction.   Reuter&#3;
