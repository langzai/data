The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME)board of directors issued a letter to its members that setslimits, but does not ban, dual trading in the S and P 500futures and options pit.    The rules prohibit brokers who execute customer orders to trade for their own account, or engage in dual trading, fromthe top step of the pit -- which the board defines as ageographically advantageous position in the pit.    Brokers who engage in dual trading in other areas of thepit must record to the nearest minute those personal trades.    The board will also set as yet unspecified percentagelimits on the trades brokers can conduct among "broker groups,"otherwise known as "trading rings."    By issuing its own rules, the CME's board rejected apetition presented in February by some CME members that soughtto prohibit dual trading of any kind in the S and P 500 pits.    The full CME membership will vote on the petition, since itwas rejected by the board, by April 13. If the members rejectthe petition, the board would be free to implement its rules, aCME spokesman said. However, the members can vote to adopt thepetition and institute a total ban on dual trading.    The board's rules on dual trading, if implemented, wouldprohibit brokers from trading for their own account once theyhave executed a customer order from the top step of the pit.    "It's a step in the right direction," said stock futuresanalysts William Marcus of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette Inc.    "It's very difficult to engage in large broker businessfrom anywhere but the top step," he said.    "If there were abuses, (the rules) should act to curbthem," Marcus added.    The spokesman for the CME said the tenor of the board ofdirectors' letter to members appears to leave open thepossibility of additional limits on dual trading. In addition,the limits set forth so far will have to be more closelydefined. Reuter&#3;
