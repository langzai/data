&lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter endedJanuary 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than lastyear's 697.0 mln dlrs.    However, the bank said it will maintain the high level ofprovisioning for loan losses established last year because ofmany market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan lossprovisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.    The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basicshare after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.    Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it usedan estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses incalculating first quarter results.    The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.    Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt anagressive posture in adding to its general provisions againstloan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federalgovernment's Inspector General of Banks.    First quarter net partly benefitted from net interestincome, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.    Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net incomewas partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,non-interest expenses and income taxes.    The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainlyto continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.    Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.    The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billiondlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs fromfiscal 1986 year-end.    "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension ofinterest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loansto this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987,and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earningsprior to the announcement," Commerce bank said.    The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact onfuture earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments. Reuter&#3;
