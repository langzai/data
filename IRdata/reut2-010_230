Northwest Aluminum Co said itwill open a second pot line in mid-May, bringing the smelterhere to 80 pct of its production capacity.    Northwest Aluminum President Brett Wilcox, who leased the30-year-old smelter from Martin Marietta Corp., said productionwould increase from around 45 tons a year at present to justover 70 tons.    Martin Marietta closed and mothballed the smelter in 1984.Northwest Aluminum reopened it last December.    Wilcox said a good aluminum market and several months ofsuccessful operation led to the decision to expand production. Reuter&#3;
