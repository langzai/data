"The Commission remains in frequent contact with thefutures markets which trade stock index futures and options,each of which has confirmed the collection of clearing marginscalled for as a consequence of futures trading on Monday,October 19, 1987," the CFTC said in a statement.

Acting CFTC Chairman Kalo Hineman said CFTC continued to"closely monitor the financial integrity of firms withpositions in the stock index futures and options markets."    A futures industry official said there was some concernamong industry leaders that stock index futures would be blamedfor the stock market's nosedive on Monday.    "This is an equity market problem," the official said. "Our(U.S.) budget deficit, (and) what's going on in the Gulf appearto be much more responsible because they shape what's happeningin futures markets."    Some lawmakers focused criticism on index arbitragetrading.    Republican Senator John Heinz said he recommended to theWhite House that daily trading limits be applied to stock indexfutures and that index futures margins be raised.    Democrat Representative Charles Schumer said Congress wouldconsider new controls over margin requirements. Reuter&#3;
