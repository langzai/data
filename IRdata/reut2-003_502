The borrowing limit of the Hong KongExchange Fund, set up to regulate the value of the Hong Kongdollar, has been raised to 50 billion H.K. Dlrs from 30 billionby the legislature, an official statement said.    The limit governs total borrowing by the fund from thegovernment's general revenue account and various funds as wellas borrowing by the fund arising from money market operations.    The bulk of the government's fiscal surplus is invested bythe Treasury with the exchange fund against the issue by thefund of interest-bearing debt certificates, Financial SecretaryPiers Jacobs said.    "At the close of the business today, the total amount ofdebt certificates issued by the Exchange Fund in return formoney transferred from the general revenue account and thevarious funds, in other words the total borrowing by theExchange Fund from these sources, will be 26.9 billion dlrs,"Jacobs said.    He said borrowing arising from money market operationswould amount to an additional 2.9 billion dlrs, making a totalof 29.8 billion dlrs, just short of the borrowing limit of 30billion dlrs.    Jacobs said the government's fiscal reserves are expectedto total 32 billion dlrs by the end of the current fiscal yearending March 31.    "The current borrowing limit of 30 billion dlrs will,therefore, constrain the ability of the Exchange Fund tocontinue to take in these fiscal reserves by the issue ofinterest-bearing debt certificates," he said.    "It will also constrain the ability of the exchange fund inits money market operations," he added. REUTER&#3;
