The Securities and ExchangeCommission reminded securities dealers that its mark-updisclosure requirements also applies to transactions onzero-coupon securities.    Dealers and brokers are required by U.S. securities law todisclose their mark-ups if they are excessive, the SEC said ina public notice.    Further, excessive mark-ups on securities transactions,whether disclosed or not, violate the rules of the nationalAssociation of Securities Dealers Inc and Municipal SecuritiesRulemaking Board, it said.    In a separate action, the SEC filed a friend-of-the-courtbrief in a private civil case involving a complaint againstMerrill Lynch over excessive mark-ups on zero-coupon bonds. Thecase is being appealed to the U.S. Appeals Court.    The lower court dismissed the complaint, finding antifraudprovisions of securities laws do not prohibit undisclosedexcessive mark-ups on securities transactions.    The SEC is urging the appeals court to reverse thedecision, citing its nearly 50 year-old position thatundisclosed excessive mark-ups by securities dealers violatethe general antifraud provisions of securities laws.
