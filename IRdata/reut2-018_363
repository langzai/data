Previously, West Germany, Britain, Portugal and Denmarkhave declared themselves against the tax with Spain's positionunclear, the sources said.    The sources said Spanish junior finance minister Guillermode la Dehesa said Spain was against the tax because of itsimplications for world trade talks within the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade and because it was discrimatory byexcluding butter.
