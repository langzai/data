U.K. Minister for Aviation MichaelSpicer said transatlantic traffic should increase at least fivepct this year, after dropping nearly six pct last year.    "We expect at least a five pct increase and it may exceedthat, reaching at least the peak levels of 1985," Spicer saidat a press conference.    The figures refer to air traffic between North America andEurope.    Spicer also said transport ministers of the EuropeanCommunity meeting next week are expected to agree onliberalizing air traffic regulations in Europe.    Spicer said fears of terrorism dissuaded Americans fromtraveling to Europe last year, resulting in pent up demand thatwill be released this year.    He said the ministers, scheduled to meet in Brussels Mondayand Tuesday, should agree on allowing more than one airline tofly particular routes between European cities, removing somefare restrictions and easing capacity restrictions.    Spicer also said he has asked U.S. officials to considerallowing investment in U.S. carriers, particularly in smallercommuter airlines, by foreign companies. He also wants U.S.officials to allow British carriers to fly more freely betweenU.S. destinations. Reuter&#3;
