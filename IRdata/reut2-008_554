Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AMS> unit&lt;Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mlndlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985.    Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in anextremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairmanand chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after avery disappointing year.    "A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a verymeagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation ofaround 10 pct," he said.    Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance ondownstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns andthe financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.    Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrsagainst 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government tomove quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.    "It is just as important for Australia to maintain afinancially healthy, technically advanced refining andmarketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration andproduction," he said.    "The Australian oil industry has the experience and thecapacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if thegovernment would stop putting roadblocks in our way," he said.    Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years toupgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but furtherinvestment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.    Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plantrose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier.    Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressurein 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth. REUTER&#3;
