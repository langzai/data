Standard and Poor's Corp said itdowngraded to AA from AA-plus the Kingdom of Denmark'slong-term external debt.    The action affects the equivalent of 17.6 billion U.S. dlrsof debt.    S and P cited Denmark's weakened external competitiveness,saying it contributed to a steady deterioration of thecountry's current account balance and a substantial rise in itsexternal debt burden.    Net foreign debt increased to 129 pct of total exports in1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P pointed out.    Standard and Poor's said that while it expects lowerimports and current account imbalances this year, rising laborcosts should further weaken Denmark's competitiveness.    However, S and P said its downgrade did not affect theA-1-plus short-term debt rating of Denmark or its wholly ownedDanish Oil and Natural Gas.    Similarly, the AA ratings on the long-term debt obligationsof Copenhagen County Authority and I/S Elsam were affirmed. Reuter&#3;
