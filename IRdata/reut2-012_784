Finance Ministry proposals forabolishing bourse transaction taxes for non-residents have beenblocked in cabinet and will not be re-submitted for severalweeks, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.    Government sources said the blockage would also delay anannouncement of measures that would simplify the procedure fornon-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding tax levied oninvestment income in Belgium.    Finance Minister Mark Eyskens told Reuters yesterday thathe hoped the cabinet would approve the bourse transaction taxproposals today.    Eyskens also said he would in the next few days announceplans to simplify and eventually stop the procedure for foreigninvestors to reclaim witholding tax.    Financial analysts said the current procedure is so slowthat it effectively acts as a barrier to foreign investment inBelgium, especially in the bond market.    They said the move to simplify it would be far moresignificant than the abolition for non-residents of the boursetransaction taxes. These are set at three rates -- 0.07 pct,0.14 pct and 0.35 pct -- according to the security transacted.    Government sources said abolition of the bourse taxes forforeign investors had been held up by concern in the cabinetover the budgetary impact of the move, put by the ministryspokesman at 125 mln francs a year.    The sources said it was likely that this proposal and plansto simplify the witholding tax procedure would now be submittedtogether to the cabinet in several weeks.    Eyskens said abolition of the transaction taxes fornon-residents would make Brussels one of the few stockexchanges in the world where foreign investors were notsubjected to such a tax. REUTER&#3;
