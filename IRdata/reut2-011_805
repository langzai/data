An official at the Ministry of Post and Telecommunicationstold Reuters the ministry's position is unchanged despitemounting pressure from London and Washington. He declinedcomment on local press reports which said the ministry wouldback a plan aimed at cooling British anger on the issue.    The press reports said Fumio Watanabe, head of theFederation of Economic Organisations, would propose thatBritain's Cable and Wireless Plc be given a five pct stake in atelecommunications firm and a seat on the board.    Watanabe was unavailable for comment.

In London yesterday, a Cable and Wireless spokesman saidthe latest reported proposals are unacceptable.    Cable and Wireless has a 20 pct stake in one of the twocompanies involved in the mooted merger.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has personallytaken up the company's cause, charging that Japan isdiscriminating against foreigners.    The United States also has vented its anger at what it seesas Japanese attempts to limit foreign participation.    Watanabe originally proposed Cable and Wireless be given upto 3.0 pct of the merged firm. The press reports said thiscould be raised to 5.0 pct, equal to the largest share of anyJapanese firm.
