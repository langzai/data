Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interimpayment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in amove aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 cropunder way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.    Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 cropindicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)crop year.    The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced486,790 tonnes.    For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayedharvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from theGovernor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.    Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would makea payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment forthe 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growersfor commencement of harvesting would be completed at all millsby June 23.    Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.    The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is thefull amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceedsreceived to-date. The balance will be paid in October.    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery tothe mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlledFiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of theforecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all caneharvested by November 30, he said.    Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance ofthe expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. Thebalance of the second payment will be made six weeks after theend of crushing."    Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that anestimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.The FDB rejected this request.    Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefullyconsider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases ofhardship on a case-by-case basis."    In response to a further demand that all soldiers beremoved from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the armywould restrict its presence in the cane areas.    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits toharvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unionsto hold the necessary meetings in preparation for thecommencement of harvest.    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers hadindicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,he added. REUTER&#3;
