The calls, to be made effective June 30 and September 30,affected respectively the 7-1/4 pct bond of 1975 for 250 mlnfrancs and the 6-1/2 pct bond of the same year for 300 mln.    A spokesman said the ministry had not yet decided whetherto convert the issues into new bonds, but it had outlined plansfor two new bonds, each of 250 mln francs.
