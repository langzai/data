New York Stock Exchange chairman JohnPhelan said the NYSE will continue to request that member firmsrefrain from using its order-delivery systems for programtrading until the record trading volume slows down.    He said the firms are free to use other systems to doarbitrage between stock-index futures and their underlyingstocks. "We are going to continue to get volatility for sometime to come," Phelan told a news conference.    He said program trading adds liquidity to the market but"at the extreme that adds to the volatility." He said furtheranalysis of the issue is needed.    Phelan said a significant number of corporations had begunbuying back their own stock in a move that helped blue chipsgain back some of Monday's losses.    Asked how the record decline on Monday and theunprecedented trading volume affected the financial health ofmember firms, Phelan said, "As far as we can tell, member firmsare in good shape."    He said he expects to appear at a Congression hearing inWashington later this week that will examine the question ofprogram trading.       Phelan said NYSE officials were in conference with otherfinancial leaders and White House chief of staff Howard Bakerfor much of the day, adding that "the whole system has beenvery supportive."    He said three or four of the NYSE's specialist firmsrequired and received help with capital. He said these firmswere no longer having capital problems but did not discussspecific figures. Asked why some stocks were delayed on openingwhile others traded, he said the exchange did not want to keepthe vast majority of the 1500 listed companies from trading. Reuter&#3;
