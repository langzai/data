The U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency said Borden Inc was fined 545,000 dlrs for the delay ofthe installation of pollution controls in its canning plant inLyons, N.Y.    The EPA said the U.S. District Court in Rochester, N.Y.,assessed the penalty in connection with its failure to complywith EPA-approved air quality regulations by July 1, 1980.    After Borden sought relief through the courts, a finalcompliance date was set for Dec 1, 1984, the EPA said.    The EPA said that Borden did not adequately correct theproblems by the date and rejected Borden's argument that it hadmade a good faith effort to rectify the problems.    Borden sold the facility to C-B Foods in January 1986, theEPA said. Reuter&#3;
