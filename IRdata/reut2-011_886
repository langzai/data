A spokesman for Jardine Matheson HoldingsLtd &lt;JARD.HK> said he could neither confirm nor deny anewspaper report which said Jardine was thinking of moving itslisted property subsidiary &lt;Hongkong Land Ltd> to Bermuda.    "I don't know how the report was originated ... I cannotcomment," the spokesman at Jardine's London office said whenasked to react to a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.    The report said Jardine, which moved its place of domicilefrom Hong Kong to Bermuda in the wake of the agreement totransfer the British colony back to China in 1997, wascontemplating a similar move for Hongkong Land.    The Daily Telegraph quoted Jardine chairman Simon Keswickas saying Hongkong Land was at a crossroads now that all itsnon-property assets as well as its major residential propertiesin Hong Kong are being sold off.    This left the company to focus its attention on prime sitecommercial property in Hong Kong's city centre only, it said.    "If we can't find any opportunities here we may have to lookabroad ... If we look abroad the structure of the companybecomes very important," Keswick was quoted as saying. REUTER&#3;
