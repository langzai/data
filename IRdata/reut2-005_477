France's state-owned Aerospatiale isworking on designs for a hypersonic plane to fly 150 passengersat five times the speed of sound, and plans to unveil computerstudies at the Paris air show in June, a company spokesmansaid.    The plane, which is similar in concept to the OrientExpress project announced by President Reagan last year, wouldhave four ram-jet motors, lacking the moving parts ofconventional turbo-jet engines, and each having 30 tonnes ofthrust.    It would cruise at an altitude of up to 30,000 metres,around three times higher than conventional aircraft and nearlytwice as high as the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic jet.    With a range of 12,000 km it would be capable of flyingfrom Paris to New York in one hour, compared with three hourstaken by Concorde, and Paris to Tokyo in two hours.    The aircraft could reach speeds in excess of 5,000 km anhour.    The Aerospatiale spokesman said its research scientists hadbeen working on the project for about two years, drawing on theexperience it gained from Concorde as well as experience inheat-resistant materials needed on high-speed aircraft which ithas developed from building French nuclear missiles.
