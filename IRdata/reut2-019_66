South Africa recorded annualisedreal growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of thisyear and the economy should achieve the government's target ofthree pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.    The South African central bank said in its quarterlybulletin that confidence in the economy improved from Januaryto May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in thenation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvementin the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.    It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in thethird and fourth quarters of last year.    It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreementreached with international creditors in March as evidence ofimproved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.    The accord effectively extends a moratorium on mostrepayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short termforeign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.    South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualisedsurplus on the current account of the balance of payments of7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplusof 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninthconsecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985. REUTER&#3;
