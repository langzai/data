Argentine President Raul Alfonsinmet for more than an hour with International Monetary FundManaging Director Michel Camdessus, and Argentine economyminister Juan Sourrouille said the two men discussedArgentina's economy and its commercial bank financing package.    Sourrouille told reporters that 91.5 pct of the 1.95billion dlr loan, which forms the core of the package, has beensubscribed.    Citibank, the chairman of Argentina's bank advisorycommittee, said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91pct.    The IMF has said that a "critical mass" of bank commitmentsis needed before it will start disbursing the 1.83 billion dlrstandby loan that it has approved in principle for Argentina.    Asked what the IMF has stipulated as a critical mass,Sourrouille said, "That has not been defined but anywhere over90 pct we are doing fine."    Although most of the money has been subscribed, officialsnoted that about a third of Argentina's 350 creditor banks hold93 pct of its debt. They are worried that it might take a longtime to persuade the other banks to join the deal.    Monetary sources said Alfonsin and Camdessus, who had notmet before, mostly discussed Argentina's political and economicsituation. Alfonsin, who is beginning a four-day private visitto the U.S., was in Philadelphia to speak to the private WorldAffairs Council, a non-partisan body dedicated to increasingpublic awareness of international affairs.    In his speech, Alfonsin said economic integration is theonly way for Latin America to overcome its current crisis.    "This (economic integration) is probably the most audaciouschallenge facing Latin America this century, perhaps the mostaudacious of our history," he said. Reuter&#3;
