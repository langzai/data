Du Pont Co, reporting lowerfirst quarter profits, said a drop in energy earnings was onlypartially offset by surging chemical and specialty products.    Du Pont earned 391 mln dlrs, or 1.62 dlrs a share, in thelatest quarter, down from 404 mln, or 1.67 dlrs a share, in1986's initial quarter.    It had sales of 7.13 billion dlrs, down from 7.17 billionlast year and total revenues of 7.20 billion dlrs down from7.29 billion dlrs.    Du Pont said after-tax operating income for its chemicaland specialty products businesses totaled 393 mln dlrs in thelatest quarter, rising 55 pct from last year's first quarterdue to improved results from most businesses, notably fibers,white pigments and specialty polymers.    Results benefited from improved worldwide demand and lowercosts attributable to lower energy feedstock prices, earlierrestructurings, and efforts to improve productivity.    It said sales of these businesses were up eight pct to 4.2billion dlrs on a sales volume increase of five pct and threepct higher average prices, reflecting a weaker dollar.    Du Pont said after-tax operating income from the petroleumsegments dropped 64 pct from a year ago to 55 mln dlrs in thelatest quarter.    These results reflect lower refined petroleum productmargins and lower worldwide crude oil and domestic natural gasprices. Coal earnings were down 27 pct on lower prices.    The company said it anticipates continued strong resultsfrom chemicals and specialty products as worldwide demandremains high. Improvement in petroleum will require flat orimproved crude oil prices and improved refined product margins. Reuter&#3;
