West Germany should take steps to increaseits official development assistance, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    A report by the organisation's Development AssistanceCommittee (DAC) said German aid levels had shown only amoderate increase in real terms in recent years, adding thatthere was a risk that growth over the next few years might slowfurther.    German aid, estimated at around four billion dlrs in 1986,represents 0.46 pct of the country's GNP. This is above theDAC's average of 0.36 pct, but might decline if correctivemeasures were not taken, the report said. REUTER&#3;
