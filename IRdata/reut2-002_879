Any European Community decision toliberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapiocaindustry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at theThailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).    He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move tocut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops morecompetitive than tapioca in the European market.    The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing morethan two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported byThailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25mln tonnes a year until 1990.    Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariffloophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pctimport duty.    Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI,suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.    He said: "If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they areclose to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappearcompletely."    He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because ithad recently joined other major commodity producers in callingon the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies. REUTER&#3;
