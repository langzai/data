&lt;General Partners>, controlled byprivately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, saidit has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorpInc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rightsfor 100 dlrs a share.    GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.    In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said theoffer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.    General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receiptof sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully dilutedbasis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners atleast 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.    It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeemingthe defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied thatthe rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtainingfrom the Federal Communications Commission a special temporaryauthorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorpshares.    General Partners said it would set up voting trustarrangements pending review of its long-form application forFCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp'sbroadcasting subsidiary.    The partnership said the offer is further conditioned onGenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend thecompany's articles of incorporation and code of regulations toprovide for an increase in authorized common shares, aclassified board of directors and the elimination of cumulativevoting.  The latter two changes would make it harder forminority shareholders to elect directors.    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for itsshareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making thevalue of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire&lt;Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew theoffer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of theTax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went privatefor 1.66 billion dlrs.    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospaceas well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to itstwo television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase itfailed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreignpayments and political contributions.    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area televisionstation WOR to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its LosAngeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license wouldalso receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.
