Two leading Senate Republicans haveurged the White House to name Commodity Futures TradingCommission (CFTC) Commissioner Kalo Hineman to replace outgoingChairman Susan Phillips, congressional sources said.    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen.Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking minority member on the SenateAgriculture Committee, both have endorsed Hineman for the topCFTC post, the sources said.    In addition, Lugar has urged White House Chief of StaffHoward Baker to recommend Mark Sullivan, White House associatepersonnel director, as CFTC commissioner, they said.    Phillips's departure July 24 will create a vacancy on thefive-person commission and require the White House to appoint anew chairman.    Earlier this month, Sullivan emerged as a leading candidateto replace Phillips, according to industry and congressionalsources.    But Sullivan's lack of experience in commodity markets hasbeen cited as a liability by industry representatives.    Hineman, a Kansas farmer, has drawn support from Dole andother members of the congressional Agriculture Committees whoare eager to have farming interests well represented on CFTC. Reuter&#3;
