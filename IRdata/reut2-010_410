Several dealers had expected the Bank of England toannounce further issues of index-linked bonds today in thelight of strength seen in this sector of the market over thepast few days. Some prices advanced by as much as 1-1/2 pointsyesterday as the rest of the market eased back further.    However, one or two traders expressed surprise that theauthorities had issued further bonds of any kind in the lightof the nervous conditions prevailing in the market.    In such relatively small amounts, the new issues wereunlikely to have a significantly harmful effect on Governmentbond prices in general, dealers said.    Prices of index-linked bonds fell back slightly after thestock tranches were announced, with the 2-1/2 pct index-linkedstock due 2016 quoted at 102-25/32 stg pct after 102-29/32shortly before the announcement.
