West German President Richard vonWeizsaecker called on creditor banks to ease pressure onArgentina's foreign debt repayment terms.    "We cannot remain indifferent to the pressure of creditorbanks, since there is correlation between political stabilityand the economic situation," Weizsaecker told reporters.    Argentina said last month it would suspend debt payments ifcreditor banks did not loosen repayment terms and grant a new2.15 billion dlr loan.    Argentina's debt is Latin America's third largest at 51billion dlrs.    Weizsaecker, on a four-day official visit to Argentina,said: "Argentina's problems require joint action from creditorand debtors countries," and not prepared recipes from creditorbanks.    A group of ecologists staged a demonstration to protestArgentina's plans to build a fourth nuclear power plant and aGerman company's role in the project as a contractor.    Earlier, Weizsaecker said that the potential of Patagonia,the barren tableland covering a third of Argentina, couldassure the economic future of the country. REUTER&#3;
