The Canadian Import Tribunal said thecountervailing duty on U.S. corn imports should be cut to 30Canadian cts a bushel from 1.10 dlrs a bushel.    In a report to the Canadian finance department, thetribunal said the duty is hurting Canadian farmers and foodprocessors. The duty was imposed last year after the revenuedepartment found U.S. corn production was subsidized.    It is now up to the government to decide whether to changethe duty. Reuter&#3;
