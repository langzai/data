The European Community (EC) shouldwatch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War andtheir consequences on the oil market, EC Energy CommissionerNicolas Mosar said today.    Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in theGulf, Mosar warned, "An escalation in the Gulf would increasetensions in the oil market."    "But I do not want to be alarmist," he told a news conferenceafter an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.    He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf haddeclined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the firstthree months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period lastyear. "There are also other potential sources of supplies in theworld," he added.    The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at theministers' meeting, he added.    A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oilsupply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annualmeeting on June 19, he said.    But any major decisions would have to be reserved for ECforeign ministers, diplomats said.    West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasmfor backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchantships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oilsupplies. Reuter&#3;
