Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mlnounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mlnin 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for JohnsonMatthey Plc said.    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisationin Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase inconsumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largestsingle application for platinum.    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was releasedin London today.    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest furtherincrease in investment buying and may well be cautious.    He said South Africa was the most likely source ofadditional supplies and will need to increase output by about500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.    The capital investment required to produce the additionaloutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the politicalclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,Clark said.    "The very probability of a growth in demand set against themassive investment required for expansion - and that expansiononly being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me toconclude that the price of platinum will be substantiallyunderpinned in the medium to long-term," Clark said.
