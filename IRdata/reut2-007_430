Provincially-owned Hydro-Quebec saidit had no obligation to supply electricity to other Canadianprovinces if it could sell it at a higher price to Americans.    The utility told a National Energy Board hearing that U.S.utilities generally offer higher prices for electricity thanthose in Canada because the Americans want firm energysupplies.    Hydro-Quebec is seeking regulatory approval to sell 70billion kilowatt hours of firm power a year to the New Englandpower pool over 10 years starting in 1990. Utilities inOntario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland oppose the sale. Reuter&#3;
