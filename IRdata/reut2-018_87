The White House has completed a newreview of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has notyet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan lastApril should be lifted, U.S. officials said.    They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked atJapan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pactyesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to behonoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.    But they also noted that the White House has said it wasunlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of theworld's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.    The officials added that while the curbs complicatedU.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was nottaking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation forJapan's failure to honor commitments to end dumpingsemiconductors in world markets at less than production costsand to open its own market to U.S. goods.    The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese televisionsets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.    Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted assoon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adheringto the pact. reuter&#3;
