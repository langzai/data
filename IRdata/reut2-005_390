The city of Amsterdam launched a 300mln guilder commercial paper program in the Dutch market, leadmanager Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV said.    The issue has denominations of one mln guilders andmaturities ranging from two weeks to one year. Clearing anddelivery is through the facilities of the Dutch central bank.    Amsterdam is the third Dutch municipality to use acommercial paper program as credit facility. The Hague andRotterdam preceded with programs arranged by Algemene BankNederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS>. Details of the first tranche of theprogram are still unknown.    "At the moment, commercial paper is a cheaper form of creditthan the traditional "kasgeldleningen'," said Amsterdam'sfinancial alderman Walter Etty after signing the contract.Current regulations allowed the city to acquire only half ofits short term borrowing requirement with CPs, he added.    Kasgeldleningen or short term advances are a widely usedinstrument in the Dutch market which has faced competition fromCPs since the Finance Ministry approved them in January 1986.    "CPs and CDs are currently slightly cheaper than traditionalcredit lines for promotional reasons," Amro board member DickMeys told journalists at the signing ceremony.    Despite the lower cost to borrowers, the Dutch market forcommercial paper and certificates of deposits is growing onlyslowly in the face of the well-developed kasgeld market andinstitutional investors have hardly discovered this instrument,Meys said.    Foreign interest in guilder CPs and CDs is almostnon-existent due to the strong position of the guilder, butAmro's London-based subsidiary EBC Amro Bank Ltd joined thesyndicate in case such interest emerges, Meys said.
