Colombia's coffee export registrationsremain open and there are no plans to close them since a newmarketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'association said.    "The philosophy of the new policy is not to closeregistrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he toldReuters.    On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April andMay for an unlimited amount.    Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exportershad registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than theaverage in recent years.    He estimated the amount of bags registered by the nationalcoffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a totalof about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month byColombia.    "The only change that could happen is, because of thevolume, we would be told that from such a date, registrationswould be for June shipment, etc" Arango said. Reuter&#3;
