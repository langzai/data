The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yenin certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreementstoday to show its determination to maintain an easy moneypolicy, central bank officials said.    "Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek anannouncement effect, in which we would reassure the market ofthe fact that we have not changed our policy stance," a seniorcentral bank official told Reuters.    The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-monthcommercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in theinterbank market today, the officials said.    The central bank was concerned about growing marketexpectations of higher interest rates, which were in partresponsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,the officials said.    But money traders said the market generally shrugged offthe bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate farbelow prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-monthCDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bidwas 3.75 pct, they said.    The bank's bill buying operation also had little impactbecause it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.    The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CDbuying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan'spledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.    "We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit gripany further," a bank manager said, adding that the prevailingmarket expectation of higher rates will remain.    "If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stayabove four pct for the time being," he said. REUTER&#3;
