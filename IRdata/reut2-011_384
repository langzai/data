"To achieve this goal will require that the businessescomprising Canadian Pacific are leaders in their respectivefields," the company said in the report to shareholders.    "Although the steps already taken to reposition and solidifyCanadian Pacific point to a better financial performance in1987, more remains to be accomplished if the company is toproduce returns that meet shareholder expectations," it said.

The charges consisted of a 362.5 mln dlr writedownrepresenting permanent impairment in asset values, partiallyoffset by a gain of 102.6 mln dlrs on sale of its interest inCominco and a gain of 29.5 mln dlrs on sale of CP Hotels'flight kitchens.    Canadian Pacific said a further extraordinary net gain of172.5 mln dlrs from the airline unit sale will be included infirst quarter results.
