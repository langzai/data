U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said the stock market overreacted to a U.S. decisionlast week to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese computerproducts.    Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a HouseAgriculture Committee hearing, Yeutter said it is "difficult tocomprehend" that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrsin goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday.    "I have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that(stock market fall), including simple profit-taking," Yeuttersaid.    Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official fromits trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on thecomputer chip dispute.    "We will be glad to have him here, but that's not going toaffect a decision that's already been made," Yeutter said.    The decision announced last week would apply higher tariffson a range of Japanese products in retaliation for the allegedfailure of Tokyo to honor an agreement with the U.S. onsemiconductor trade.
