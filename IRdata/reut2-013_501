Malaysian and Indonesian palm oilproduction is likely to drop sharply this year, due to loweryields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    The publication expects total Malaysian output duringJan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. ForEast Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.    It said new plantings had slowed markedly in bothcountries, but the effects of this will not be felt until1988-90.    Above normal yields during recent years resulted in treesreacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more maleinflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.    Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affectedthis year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This couldespecially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April andJuly/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.    Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year'syields and bigger effects are expected within the next threeyears, Oil World said without elaborating.    Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this yearwere put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 inJanuary 1986, Oil World said.    West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of EastMalaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.    Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall abouteight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. OverallIndonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pctto 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however,are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.    Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements areboth running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects thecountry's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes duringJan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead ofthe April elections and the religious Ramadan festivalthroughout May, it said.    Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recentIndonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter thecountry but be transshipped to other countries to fulfillIndonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.
