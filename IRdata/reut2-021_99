"We are confident that whatever volume we have thisafternoon, we can handle it," said Richard Torrenzano, a vicepresident at the NYSE.    With two hours of trading left, a record 422 mln shareshave traded hands, far outpacing the volume on the market'sbusiet days. The previous busiest day was last Friday, when 338mln shares traded.    "Our systems have been tested and they can handle heavyvolume effectiviy and efficiently," Torrenzano said.    He said the Exchange has been in constant contact with theSecurities and Exchange Commission concerning today's recordbreaking decline and heavy volume. He declined to comment onthe context of those discussions.    Earlier today, SEC chairman David Ruder said a brieftrading halt has been discussed as one way of restoring orderto the market, but stressed he is not recommending one at thistime. He did not say if the option was discussed with the NYSE. Reuter&#3;
