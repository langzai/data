H.J. Heinz &lt;HNZ.N> chairman Tony O'Reillywould be interested in buying Guinness PLC &lt;GUIN.L>'s brewerydivision if it were for sale, a spokesman said.    The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports,said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer thebrewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put togethera consortium, nor has he been buying shares."    He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance assaying he would be interested if it came on the market and thathe had the support of two international banks if he decidedsuch a purchase might be worthwhile.    In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewingprofits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts,the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.    "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack forthe brewing division in the current Guinness situation," hesaid.    "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge,but not impossible," he added.    The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian andMalaysian breweries because "It could only be sold as anintegral unit if it was going to be sold at all," O'Reilly said. Reuter&#3;
