Finance Minister Roger Douglas saidNew Zealand would enact legislation to prevent local companiesand individuals from using overseas tax havens.    The government would also outlaw the practice of doublededuction of losses by dual resident companies, known as "doubledipping," Douglas said in a budget statement.    The anti-tax-haven legislation would affect non-residententities, such as companies and trusts, set up in low taxcountries and earning mainly passive investment income, Douglassaid.    A consultative document will be released in Septemberexplaining the proposed legislation, and a consultativecommittee will then receive public submissions and advise thegovernment on implementation, Douglas said.    The legislation would attack tax avoidance but not genuinebusiness activity, he added.    He said some New Zealand residents were avoiding NewZealand tax entirely by setting up non-resident entities in taxhavens, which intercepted and gathered income taxable in NewZealand.    In a move to counter "double dipping," the government wouldno longer allow dual resident companies to group their losses,Douglas said.    The proposed legislation would require them to carry taxlosses forward to be offset against future profits, effectivefor income years starting after December 17, 1986. REUTER&#3;
