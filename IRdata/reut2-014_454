The Reagan administration is secretlydeveloping plans for an early deployment of President Reagan'scontroversial "Star Wars" anti-missile system, according to aSenate study.    "Near-term deployment is an absurd and dangerous course forAmerica," said Sen. Bennett Johnston in a statement issued withthe report. "It would force us to break the bank, throw out theABM treaty and commit us to an arms race in space."    The Reagan administration is engaged in an internal debateover the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), as the land andspace-based anti-missile system is called, and may decide laterthis month to reinterpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missiletreaty to justify an acceleration of SDI research to includedevelopment and space testing.    Johnston, of Louisiana, and fellow Democrat WilliamProxmire of Wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accusedthe administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as apolitical ploy to commit the United States to strategicdefenses even after Reagan leaves office in 1989.    "This report exposes the fact that without a presidentialdirective or congressional consent, the SDI program ... isbeing changed to pursue a near-term deployment of strategicdefenses," Proxmire, chairman of the powerful SenateAppropriations Defense Subcommittee, said.    "In other words, they're covertly reorienting the SDIprogram without congressional approval."   Reuter&#3;
