Central Bank President Jose LuisMachinea said Argentina could adopt the same posture as Braziland suspend payments on its foreign debt if it failed to meetcreditor bank demands.    "If Argentina had the same difficulties in being unable torefinance (its debt) under the desired (creditor) conditions,that (Brasil's) is a path to take," Machinea said.    Brasil last month suspended payments on a large part of its109-billion dlr debt, the highest in the developing world.    Machinea said Brasil did not suspend payments because itwanted to but because it lacked reserves.    Argentina has since last month been negotiating a 2.15billion dlr loan with the steering committee for itsinternational creditor banks to meet 1987 growth targets.    But Machinea said the talks were difficult and Argentinawanted to conclude them as soon as possible.    "What the (creditor) banks are demanding is not the same aswhat Argentina is prepared to concede," Machinea said.    Argentina has a global foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs. Itsdebt with private banks is about 30 billion dlrs. Reuter&#3;
