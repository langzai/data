The Senate defeated a move to blockdlrs 40 mln in military aid to the Nicaraguan "contra" rebels,virtually assuring the aid will go through.    The 52-to-48 vote was a victory for President Reagan, whomade the contra program the centerpiece of his Central Americanpolicy.    The vote virtually guaranteed that 40 mln dlrs -- the finalinstallment of a 100 mln-dlr aid package approved by Congresslast year -- would reach the rebels fighting the leftistManagua government.
