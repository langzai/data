The Amsterdam Stock Exchange todaydeclined to comment on a press report saying Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc's request for membership had been delayed pendinginvestigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.    The Exchange was replying to Reuters inquiries after theleading Dutch evening daily NRC Handelsblad published a reportthis evening quoting an unnamed bourse official as sayingDrexel's application was delayed while the firm was underinvestigation by the SEC.    It usually takes the bourse one to two months to process amembership application, the official said, adding: "It's beengoing on for three to four months with Drexel, so draw your ownconclusions."   "We're not particularly worried about the contents of theapplication but we think the timing is somewhat unfortunate,"the NRC quoted the official as saying.   Drexel is currently under investigation by the SEC inconnection with insider trading activities by Ivan Boesky andDennis Levine last November, a month after the company appliedfor permission to deal in Dutch equity.   An exchange spokesman said there was nothing unusual aboutthe processing period of Drexel's application, adding that hewould not comment on any company before all documents had beenstudied by the bourse board.   A spokesman from Drexel's London branch, which is dealingwith the application, said the delay was of a purely technicalnature in Drexel's head office in New York. Reuter&#3;
