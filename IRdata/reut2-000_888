Japanese investor interest in Britishgilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectationssterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, andon calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.    Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have beenexpanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investorsseeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, whichhave been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.    Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct hasbeen getting stronger, the general manager of the local officeof a British securities firm said.    On the other hand, major long-term investors such asJapanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic aboutbuying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of theJapanese financial year, traders said.    These investors, who must convert yen into sterling throughdollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buyingin London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a Britishsecurities house said.    The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of230 to 234 late last year.    Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling willfurther appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit fromfurther declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.    "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds,suggesting further market improvement and continuing demandfrom brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant managerMachiko Suzuki.    She said she expected the yield on the actively traded11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London. REUTER&#3;
