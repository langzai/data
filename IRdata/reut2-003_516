Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> islikely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12pct of share capital, deputy general-director GuidoSchmidt-Chiari said.    The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previousyear and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's sharecapital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986from 2.7 billion a year earlier.    Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference whenthe bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profitof 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.    Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.    The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total roseto 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.    General director Hannes Androsch said higher investmentwould lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Lastyear's better profits had resulted from improvements inservices provided by the bank and also in profits on schillinglending.    Schilling lending had grown last year and interest ratemargins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory whencompared with those in other countries, he said.    Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home andabroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.    Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business hadfallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheettotal.    In an attempt to generate more foreign business,representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, HongKong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans toabolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares anddrawing dividends.    Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt roseeight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokerssaid improved results had been widely expected by investors.    Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria'slargest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized andlarge Austrian companies.    But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG &lt;SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similarto the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings. REUTER&#3;
