This year will see a pickup in U.S.economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committeesaid in its semi-annual policy statement.    The SOMC, a group of basically "monetarist" privateeconomists, said that "economic growth will accelerate in 1987in response to powerful stimulative actions by the FederalReserve."    The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As aresult, it said that "inflation and ultimately anotherrecession now loom on the horizon."    The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely onprogressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not leadto sustainable economic growth and stable prices.    The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic orinflation growth in its policy statement. However, theCommittee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it wasbasically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is amember of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.    Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentagepoint higher than in the past two years. He expects consumerprices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.    The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has beena principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costlyinflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to "abandonits inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetarybase on the path toward sustained lower inflation."    The Fed in February said it would no longer target thenarrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 andeconomic growth has been largely severed.&#3;
