All steers imported into the UnitedStates from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on theright jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its World Production and Trade Report, the departmentsaid the branding is necessary to improve surveillance forbovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way toidentify Mexican steers.    The requirement is not expected to affect the number ofMexican steers imported into the United States and the brandwill be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports ofentry.    Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an exportquota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87season (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States. Reuter&#3;
