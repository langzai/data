The gold mining industry hadanother "exceptional year" in 1986 with tonnage milled, revenuesand profits reaching high levels, the Chamber of Mines said.    Nearly 108 mln tons of ore was milled, three pct higherthan the prior year, while revenues rose 17 pct to 16.5 billionrand and profits increased 6.5 pct to 8.31 billion rand, theChamber reported.    The profit rise was achieved despite substantial costincreases and a 26.1 pct rise in capital expenditures to 2.42billion rand, it said.    The chamber said that a "comparatively buoyant gold priceallowed mines to continue the practise of mining lower gradeores which has characterised recent years."    It said the industry now mines to an average grade of 5.63grams per ton compared with 6.09 grams per ton in 1985.    Gold output for the year declined five pct to 638 tonscompared with the previous year's 671 tons. REUTER&#3;
