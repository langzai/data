Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd postedtheir biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stockmarkets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for thedebt-heavy company.    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange andgained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto StockExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as highas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Domehas normally moved by only a few cents per day.    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlrCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, butDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also stilltalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believedto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterdaystressed that its bid is "a Canadian solution to the financialdifficulties of Dome Petroleum."    "The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont&lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadianinterest in 1975 and could be getting back in," said Wilf Gobertof Peters and Co Ltd.    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that BritishPetroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despiteBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percentof Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has saidin recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talkswith Dome.    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "awfullyoptimistic," given TransCanada's offer to give current Domeshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10dlrs Canadian per common share.    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferredshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, whichwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanadawould own 80 pct.    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at thepotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. "TheTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"he said.    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "at theupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with anotherone billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available tosecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above acertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billionCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took onseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the companywanted to expand.    "There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capableof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on thatbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"Gobert said.    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that itis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holdsreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billioncubic feet of natural gas.    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acresof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, theheart of Canada's oil industry.   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres ofland across Canada.   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrsCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be thelargest ever by a Canadian company.    Reuter&#3;
