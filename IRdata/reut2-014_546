The ministries of Finance and Justicesaid they have presented parliament with a new law to makeinsider trading in shares a criminal offence.    A year ago, the Amsterdam Bourse announced its own rules,effective from January 1, 1987, aimed at preventing unfair useof inside information in the trading shares listed on theexchange, but said back-up legislation was essential.    The proposed law calls for up to two years imprisonment,fines of up to 100,000 guilders for an individual and onemillion guilders for a company, and repayment to the state ofprofits made from insider dealing.    The proposed fines are higher than any currently in forcein Dutch law, a joint statement from the two ministries said.    The draft law sets no limit to the illegal profits to berepaid. The amount would be determined by a court.    A Finance Ministry spokesman said the time-frame for theintroduction of the new legislation depended entirely on itsreception in Parliament.    In the meantime the Bourse's Share Trading Associationmonitors business closely, frequently suspending or evenrescinding dealings in a stock when price movements suggestthat foreknowledge of a pending announcement is beingexploited.
