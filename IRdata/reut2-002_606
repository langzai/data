The Mississippi River is now open forbarge traffic up to the Twin Cities in Minnesota after repairswere completed and the first barges moved upstream through Lockand Dam 20 near Quincy, Ill at 0600 CST today, an Army Corps ofEngineers spokesman said.    About 14 to 15 inches of ice were reported between locksthree and four on the upper Mississippi River, but othersections were generally free of ice, the spokesman said.    Midwestern weather has been so mild that barges probablycould have kept loading at Mid-Mississippi River terminalsthrough the winter, if Lock and Dam 20 had not been scheduledfor repairs, he said.    The Peoria and La Grange locks on the Illinois River arestill scheduled to close July 13, for two months of repairs. Reuter&#3;
