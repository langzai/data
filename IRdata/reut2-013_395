Industrial production in the EuropeanCommunity (EC) in January showed no growth compared withJanuary 1986, the EC statistics office, Eurostat, said in areport.    It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980,stood at 103.9 in both months.    EC officials said while the lack of growth may have beendue in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of theEC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend.    Eurostat said for the last three months for which figuresare known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared withthe year-earlier period.    Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about1.8 pct, well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12months ending last June, the office said. REUTER&#3;
