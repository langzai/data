Office of Management and BudgetDirector James Miller said President Reagan will reject the taxincrease called for in the House Budget Committee's 1988 budgetproposal which is before the House for a vote today.    "It's just completely unacceptable," Miller told a HouseAppropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service andGeneral Government Appropriations.    The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budgetcommittee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, ofwhich 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writingcommittees.    The House committee's budget proposal includes someincreases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs intaxes.    Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficitwould jeopardize the U.S. economy.    "If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place thiseconomic expansion that we've had in the last five years atrisk," Miller told the subcommittee.    "The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increasesubstantially the prospects that the expansion would come to anend," Miller said. Reuter&#3;
