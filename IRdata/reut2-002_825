USAir Group said it sought the helpof the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fightwith Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to orderTWA to sell its USAir shares.    "What they have done is in direct violation of the FederalAviation Act," USAir said.    It said TWA week filed a cursory application with theDepartment of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65billion dlr takeover of USAir.    USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Departmentof Transportation to dismiss the application.    USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoidedpre-merger notification requirements, and also did not providea competitive and public interest analysis required underregulations.    USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would belimited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstandingshares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10pct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir'sstock.    TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings tomore than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding.    TWA vice president general counsel Mark Buckstein said thecompany had made appropriate filings with the DOT and was incompliance with the law. Reuter&#3;
