A settlement could soon be reached in thedispute between European sugar producers and the EuropeanCommunity over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes,president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leadingthe protest, told journalists today.    "Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few daysindicate that we are moving towards a solution," he said, addingthat if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.    Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes ofsugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC'spolicy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failedto give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtainby offering sugar into EC intervention.    At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparentconcession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 Europeancurrency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producerssay is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate whichwas 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.    Vernes would not say what form any compromise between theproducers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed thelong-term desire of producers to export to the world market,providing they were not losing money by doing so.    Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, orat any time over the following five weeks before the officialpayment date.    The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internalmarket if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers. REUTER&#3;
