Gulf Arab states must coordinateeconomic policies more closely before moving towards their goalof a unified currency system, the President of the Arab BankersAssociation said.    Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of anArab currency traders meeting: "We have to start withcoordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a commonsystem of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to goyet."    He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be aplausible project.    The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- SaudiArabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United ArabEmirates --  have held a series of meetings this year toexamine linking their currencies to a single peg in a systemwhich bankers say could be modelled on the European MonetarySystem (EMS).    At present, five currencies are linked either officially orin practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar ispegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.    A common currency system or EMS-style "grid" would, intheory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stableexchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at avery low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remainsmall. "Capital markets in the Arab world are still in theirinfancy," he said.    Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, apaucity of financial instruments and a legal framework thatoften does not recognise the western banking concept ofinterest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.
