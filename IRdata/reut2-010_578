A senior Nicaraguan official said arecent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politicallydisastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.    Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuencawas in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)executive board producer members after a meeting last weekendin Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers todiscuss the fall in coffee prices.    London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.    Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failedto agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results onLatin America, both economically and politically.    He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers topave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.    Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices underan International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year agowhen prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.    Central American economic ministers have estimated theregion will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,Martinez said.    He said ICO quota talks broke down last month becauseconsumer members lack the political will to fully supportcommodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate toproducers. REUTER&#3;
