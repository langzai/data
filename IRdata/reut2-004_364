Morocco is likely to get an extra aidpackage exceeding 100 mln Special Drawing Rights (126 mln dlrs)in 1987 following a three-day Consultative Group meeting ofdonors chaired by the World Bank, Moroccan Finance MinisterMohamed Berada said.    Berrada said most of the extra aid sought to complete highpriority investments in agriculture, education, and publichealth had already been secured, and additional sums werelikely to emerge from forthcoming bilateral meetings withdonors.    A World Bank statement said the Consultative Group meetingattended by 15 donor countries and agencies noted withsatisfaction a marked improvement in Morocco's economicperformance and urged it to continue recent adjustment efforts.    It added that the Group saw as realistic Morocco'smedium-term goal of restoring creditworthiness on financialmarkets, and agreed to reconvene in a year to discuss Morocco'sfive year development strategy for 1988-92, introduced in itsbroad outlines at this week's meeting.    Morocco reached an agreement here last week with the ParisClub of western creditor governments to reschedule over 10years the 900 mln dlrs of debt due by mid 1988. That followedan agreement late last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs ofcommercial bank debt.    Morocco's foreign debt currently totals 14 billion dlrs,Berrada said, adding that Morocco intended to stop reschedulingits debts, and pay them off instead.    He told Reuters the forthcoming five-year development plan,designed to avoid the negative effects of adjustment withoutgrowth, could require further aid of 700 or 800 mln dlrs. REUTER&#3;
