French farmers are planning to cut theirmaize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this yearfrom the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French MaizeProducers' Association, AGPM, said.    It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicatedcuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region ofPicardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha lastyear.    In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantingswere estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested244,000 ha.    Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between ninepct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In thesouth-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similararea to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided watersupplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after thelast two years of drought.    Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL,said sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated atbetween 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested lastyear, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha againstlast year's harvested 48,000.
