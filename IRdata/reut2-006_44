&lt;Phoenix Canada Oil Co Ltd> said itintends to appeal a ruling in U.S. Federal District Court ofDelaware on its suit against Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, Chevron Corp&lt;CHV>, Chevron's Gulf Oil unit and their Ecuador subsidiaries.    The court ruled against Phoenix's claim that a royalty itheld should have entitled it to a share of the 160 mln U.S.dlrs paid to the defendants when they sold 62.5 pct of theirworking interest in Ecuador oil operations, Phoenix said.    However, the court did award Phoenix 1,250,000 Canadiandlrs in underpayments, the company said.    Phoenix Canada Oil said the fiduciary relationship thatexisted between Phoenix, as the royalty owner, and thedefendants, as the working interest operators, was fundamentalin the oil industry and was not reflected in the court'sruling.
