Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> , thebrewing group, has challenged a 5.2 mln stg payment to a U.S.Lawyer who says he organised its controversial takeover ofScotch whisky maker &lt;The Distillers Co Plc>.    But attorneys for lawyer Thomas Ward, a member of theGuinness board, told a court yesterday in the Channel Island ofJersey that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services inlast year's 2.7 billion stg takeover.    Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is investigatingthe takeover.    Guinness says its former chairman Ernest Saunders and Ward"breached their fiduciary duty" in authorising the payment toWard, via a Jersey-based company, Marketing and AcquisitionsConsultants and has gone to the Jersey court to recover it.    MAC said in defence documents that Ward was the mainnegotiator in the battle for Distillers against rival bidderArgyll &lt;AYLL.L> Group Plc.    "The bid would not have been successful but for the ...Services of Mr Ward," MAC attorneys said in the documentssubmitted in court. "The payment was, in all the circumstances,reasonable, proper and fully earned." REUTER&#3;
