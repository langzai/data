Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the systemon the expiry of a securities repurchase pact. But dealers saidthey expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow witha new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.    Commerzbank AG's management board chairman Walter Seippcalled on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protectthe mark through bringing the allocation rate for securitiesrepurchase agreements down.    But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease creditpolicies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreignpressure for lower rates and no signs of a change.

Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7billion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over thefirst 30 days of March, the exact requirement needed just oneday before the end of the month.
