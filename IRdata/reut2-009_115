Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumitasaid that current exchange rates are almost within the levelsagreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.    Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflectedeconomic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflectfundamentals.    Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated tobring about currency stability in line with the Parisagreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperateto that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene ifnecessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall waslikely.    But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currencylevels would be considered in line with underlying economicfundamentals.    In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to holdcurrencies around their then current levels.    Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behindthe fall of the dollar to a record low against the yenyesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as itnervously reacted to statements abroad and to developmentssurrounding trade tensions.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekendthat the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for thedollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter calledU.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.    The market reacted nervously because the dollar has beenmoving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate toremain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharprise of the yen.    The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange ratesin line with the Paris accord, he added. REUTER&#3;
