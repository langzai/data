Australian coal industry sources saidJapanese electricity utilities are demanding price cuts inannual coal contract negotiations underway in Tokyo.    But the sources said they were unable to substantiatereports here that one of the largest steaming coal customers&lt;Chugoku Electric Power Co Inc> threatened to stop takingdeliveries until new prices are set.    Coal exporters want to maintain last year's 32 U.S. Dlrs atonne price, which expired at the end of Japan's fiscal year onMarch 31, while the Japanese want to pay no more than the 27-28U.S. Dlrs secured with China and South Africa.    Ross McKinnon, general manager of &lt;Thiess Dampier MitsuiCoal Pty Ltd>, which annually exports about one mln tonnes ofsteaming coal to Japan, mainly to Chugoku, told Reuters he hadnot been informed of any refusal to take shipments.    McKinnon said he could not recall when a Japanese contracthad been settled before the previous one had expired, and said"controlled leaks" were commonplace during talks.    But Australian foreign currency markets took the reportsseriously enough for dealers to say it added nervousness totrading, with the local dollar settling on 0.7080 U.S. Cents atmidsession against its 0.7120 opening.    Coal was Australia's largest single export in the fiscalyear ended June 30, 1986 with shipments reaching 90.49 mlntonnes worth 5.21 billion dlrs, or 15.9 pct of total exports.    Japan is the largest customer for the crucial steaming coalsector and took 14.97 mln tonnes of total exports of 43.3 mlntonnes in calendar 1986.    Sydney resources analyst Ian Story said the appreciation ofthe Australian dollar against the U.S. Currency meant steamingcoal exporters were now receiving just 44.72 dlrs a tonneagainst 52.42 dlrs when last year's contract was negotiated.
