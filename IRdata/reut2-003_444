Ultramar Plc &lt;UMAR.L> said that whileits fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational pointof view, several special charges adversely affected results.    Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstreamoperations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices anddownstream operations also affected in the first half by largelosses on inventories.    But margins improved in the second half and in particularrefining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a goodrecovery.    The company was commenting on results that showed a netloss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in1985.    The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stgprovision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialledby Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquidnatural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownershipof Gulf Canada's marketing assets.    Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of afurther reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by awithdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling itsU.S. Flag shipping operation.    The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertainalthough it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increasein the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimisticprices would strengthen over the longer term.    Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas putit in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.    In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improveprofitability by selling or restructuring weak operations whilestrengthening core businesses and developing a soundoperational and financial base.    Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalledabout 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.    Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from181p at last night's close.
