Applied Biosystems Inc saidit has lowered its internal product sales forecast following areview of market conditions in Europe.    The company also said Chairman Sam Eletr has resigned forpersonal reasons.    The company said it now expects third quarter, ending March31, sales to approximate the second quarter's 21.1 mln dlrs andthird quarter earnings to be less than the second quarter's 2.7mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, due to unexpected Europeansoftness and previously announced new product delays.    Applied Biosystems earned 2,654,000 dlrs, or 20 cts ashare, in 1986's third quarter on sales of 13.4 mln dlrs.    Explaining European orders have not materialized at therate expectd, the company added "we believe that the slownessin orders reflects current conditions in the market forresearch instrumentation in Europe."    It said sales in the current quarter are also beingaffected by the previously announced delay in completion of thesoftware for the Model 900A Data Analysis Module. Theunavialability of that product also impacts sales of theassociated model 420A Derivatizer system.    Applied Biosystems said it presently expects this softwarewill be completed during the fourth quarter, but the resultinglack of demonstration units in the field may postpone somesales.    Due to the delays and European uncertainties, "we must nowview the coming quarters with caution," it said, adding "someearnings pressure is anticipated during the remainder of thisfiscal year."
