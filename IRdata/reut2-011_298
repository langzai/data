French channeltunnel consortium, needs to launch its planned 7.7-billionfranc third stage capital increase by end July to cover ongoingproject costs, French co-chairman Andre Benard said today.    If the proposed public share offering was delayed beyondthen, Eurotunnel would have to find bridging finance, he toldreporters during a visit by French parliamentarians to theconstruction site of the French tunnel terminal.    Early elections in Britain could cause such a delay, henoted.    Britain's lower house of Parliament last month passed abill endorsing the construction of the 50-km (31-mile) tunnel.The bill still needs approval of the upper house of Lords.    Benard said the consortium had decided after lengthydiscussion to issue an identical mix of securities in theLondon and Paris markets, but details of the precise packagehad still to be decided.    The offering would comprise approximately three billionfrancs in each market with another 1.5 billion offered in theUnited States, Japan and other European markets. Timing will beset to take account of the French privatisation program.   Earlier this month a Eurotunnel official said theratification bill should go before the National Assembly (lowerhouse) early next month before passing to the Senate (upperhouse) at the end of May.    Eurotunnel officials expect work on the sites to start inDecember or January. The tunnel should be completed by 1993 foran overall cost of 50 billion francs. REUTER&#3;
