First City Bancorp of Texas Inc &lt;FBT>said it was talking with several parties about its previouslyannounced efforts to bolster its capital position.    The statement, issued yesterday, did not say how close thebank was to a merger or recapitalisation program.    "Several parties have expressed an interest in working withFirst City," it said. "This exploration process has not beencompleted and therefore it would be premature to speculate onthe alternative that First City might pursue." First City had "sufficient time" to find a solution to itsfinancing problems, the statement added.    A spokesman said the statement was a response to severalrecent inquiries about First City's progress in strengtheningits weak capital position.    Its problems were caused in part by slumps in Texas realestate and oil prices.    First City, which lost a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, had afirst quarter loss of 44.5 mln dlrs. The bank earlier said itpredicted a smaller loss for 1987.    Banking analysts said First City is unlikely to attract asuitor unless federal regulators offer buyout assistance.
