New England Electric System's auditorshave again qualified the utility's annual report because ofuncertainty about whether its oil and gas subsidiary canrecover its investments.    The qualification was noted in the annual report which NewEngland Electric released at a security analysts meeting today.The auditors also qualified the company's 1985 report for thesame reason, noting the sharp drop in oil and gas prices inearly 1986.    President Samuel Huntington told analysts the utility willhave to take a write-down of about 235 mln dlrs if Federalregulators do not allow the company to pass on the losses citedby the accountants to its rate payers.
