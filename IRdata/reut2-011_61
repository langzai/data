Texas' cotton crop stands littlechance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight inthat state, as very little cotton has been planted, accordingto Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.    "It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pctof the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann,a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service inAustin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department.    Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting hadbegun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, withplanting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated tobegin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year,Stillmann said.    Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to dropto freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio GrandeValley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s,according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc.    The price of new-crop cotton on the New York cotton futuresmarket rallied today on weather-related fears. Reuter&#3;
