Dutch butter consumption rose at theexpense of margarine last year partly because of the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) cheap butter schemes, the Commodity Board forMargarine, Fats and Oils (MVO), said.    Butter consumption rose to 4.1 kilos per head in 1986 fromfour kilos in 1985, while margarine consumption including lowfat margarine, fell to 14 kilos per head from 14.3 kilos.    The low fat margarine figure remained static at 2.6 kilosper head, while ordinary margarine fell from 11.7 kilos perhead to 11.4 kilos.    However, cheap butter schemes may not be the onlycontributory factor in the changes. The MVO figures show afairly steady rise in total butter consumption and fall inmargarine consumption since 1973.    A graph produced in the MVO annual report shows total Dutchmargarine consumption in 1973 at just under 210,000 tonnesagainst around 165,000 in 1986.    The same graph shows total butter consumption in 1973 atjust over 30,000 tonnes compared with just short of 60,000tonnes last year.    However, during the same period total Dutch edible fat andoil consumption on a fat content basis has risen from around345,000 tonnes to 360,000 tonnes, or an average of 24.8 kilosper head in 1986.    The graph shows that most of the increase has come frombutter and household cooking oil usage. Reuter&#3;
