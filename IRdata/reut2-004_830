A proposal by the Chicago MercantileExchange's (CME) board of directors to restrict dual trading bystock-index futures floor brokers would not provide a solutionto alleged abuses in the market, House Small Business Committeechief economist John Helmuth said.    Helmuth worked on legislation offered earlier this week byRep. Neil Smith (D-Iowa) to ban dual trading in the Standardand Poor's 500 stock index futures trading pit.    Last night the CME board recommended curbing, but notbanning, dual trading in S and P 500 futures and options.    The CME board rejected a petition presented in February bysome members seeking an outright ban on dual trading, whereby floor brokers trade for their own accounts as well as forcustomers.    Helmuth said the board's proposal would not prevent tradersfrom falsifying the record that shows the times of theirtrades.    Helmuth predicted Smith's bill would be closely examined bythe House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. JohnDingell (R-Michigan). Dingell and his staff were unavailablefor comment.
