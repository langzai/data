Repligen Corp said it intendsto file an investigational new drug application to the Food andDrug Administration seeking permission to test its AIDS vaccinein humans by the early summer.    Repligen said the human tests could begin by the end of theyear.    "We are sufficiently encouraged and impressed by the workto date to go ahead with a clinical trial," said Michael Egan,manager of business development for Repligen, a biotechnologycompany.    Repligen's Egan said the vaccine contains a subfragment ofthe protein coat of the AIDS virus. In animal tests, whichincluded primates, Egan said the vaccine provoked neutralizingantibodies to the AIDS virus and broader cellular immunity.    Egan said the approach Repligen is using to deliver itsvaccine, using standard vaccine methods, may be safer thanvaccines using a live smallpox virus to carry proteins found onthe surface coat of the AIDS virus.    Yesterday, Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY> said it would seekregulatory permission to test its AIDS vaccine, which uses asmallpox virus, in humans by the end of the month.    Repligen's AIDS vaccine is a collaborative effort of thecompany, Centocor Inc &lt;CNTO>, Duke University Medical Schooland the National Cancer Insitutes. The research teams aredirected by John Ghrayeb of Centocor, Scott Putney of Repligen,Dani Bolognesi at Duke and Robert Gallo and Flossie Wong-Staalat the National Cancer Institute.    Although there are several AIDS vaccine candidates, expertsbelieve that development of a safe and effective vaccine is along ways away. Moreover, seeking approval to test a vaccine isonly the first step in a long process of verifying if thevaccine actually will prevent infection. Reuter&#3;
