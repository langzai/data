Congressional budget negotiators may reach an agreement this week on a 1988 budget plan, House andSenate Budget Committee sources said.    They held out hope that an agreement can be hammered out,especially over the thorny issues of taxes and defence spendinglevels.    "It may come this week," a Senate source said. "They aremaking progress," a House source said about back roomnegotiations.    Despite these new notes of optimism, earlier hopes forquick agreement had been dashed when negotiators stalled.          House and Senate negotiators, working on different budgets,have been stymied over proposals for new taxes and defencespending levels. Both measures seek 18 billion dlrs in newtaxes in 1988, but the Senate proposes nearly 119 billion dlrsin taxes over a four year span, while the House calls for only57 billion dlrs over three years.    The Senate plan would allocate about seven billion dlrs ayear for defence, a proposal not in the House plan which callsfor 1988 defence spending levels nearly eight billion dlrsunder the Senate plan.             The two sides have not had a formal negotiating meetingsince May 13. Both House and Senate would have to approve afinal compromise budget, which would be the working U.S. budgetfor fiscal 1988, starting Oct. 1.     Although the congressional budget proposes tax levels, theactual approval of specific tax plans must be implementedthrough legislationd rafted by the House Ways and MeansCommittee and Senate Finance Committee which have been cool tothe idea of higher taxes.
