Chicago Board of Trade, CBT,President Thomas Donovan said he was confident the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, CFTC, would not force the CBT andthe MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, MCE, to merge speculativeposition limits on futures contracts traded on the twoexchanges.    Last month CFTC proposed combining CBT and MCE contracts oncorn, wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and oats for the purposesof applying speculative position limits.    Donovan told Reuters he had spoken to CFTC officials aboutthe matter and believed they would modify the proposal.    CBT officials have complained the CFTC was reneging on acommitment made when the two exchanges formed an affiliation,and proposing to decrease spot month limits on the MCE contraryto congressional intent.
