Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats areprobably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cutto only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with10.6 mln a year earlier.    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin andcastor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,lard and tallow/greases.    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight productionincrease of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in theprevious two seasons.    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusuallylow prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demandfor both food and non-food purposes, it said.    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mlntonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higherif the Indian government did not artificially curb domesticdemand.    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax wereintroduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption. Reuter&#3;
