Soldiers killed one man andseriously wounded several others as they barred a group oflandless peasants from 120 acres of land seized from Canadianmissionaries in northern Haiti, a source at the Cap Haitienchurch radio said.    The soldiers, acting yesterday on orders from the Haitianattorney general, had used tear gas and fired warning shotsinto the air prior to the shootings, the source said.    There was no official confirmation of the report.    Seven men who refused to leave the land were arrested afterthe shootings and would be tried, he said.    The source said the peasants, who are illiterate, had heardthat Article 36 of Haiti's new constitution, ratified bypopular referendum on March 29, allows for land seizures. Infact, the constitution forbids land seizures except as part ofa court-sanctioned agrarian reform process.    The Canadian missionaries, the Sacred Heart Brothers, hadbought the land from the state during the government ofdictator Jean Claude Duvalier and had planted sugar cane on it,the source said.    "...the peasants are starving to death," the source toldReuters, "and they saw that the Canadians were working a largefertile property." Reuter&#3;
