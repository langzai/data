West German President Richard vonWeizsaecker said both debtor and creditor nations shareresponsibility for the Third World's foreign debt crisis.    Weizsaecker, in a speech on the first day of an officialvisit to Argentina, said: "Debtor and creditor countries havecreated this situation jointly. They also share responsibilityfor finding lasting solutions."    Local officials have payed great importance toWeizsaecker's visit because they consider him a key backer ofmore flexible repayment terms for Argentina's 51 billion dlrforeign debt, Latin America's third largest.    Weizsaecker, speaking at a reception held for him byPresident Raul Alfonsin at Buenos Aires' City Council hall,also said no one could overlook the enormity of the obstacleposed by the foreign debt to countries like Argentina.    "Democracy in Latin America must not be endangered becauseof misery or new injustices," he said.    Argentine officials said they might halt debt payments lastmonth if creditor banks did not agree to a new 2.15 billion dlrloan. An Argentine mission is now in the U.S. For talks with 11banks, seeking to win an easing of repayment terms and securethe loan.    Weizsaecker said Argentina has had difficulties with theEuropean Community over trade barriers and subsidies for grainexports.    "We are making efforts to eliminate them with the help ofbalanced interest from all parties," he said.    Argentina has said the barriers and subsidies cut unfairlyinto the country's traditional markets for its grain exports.    Weizsaecker arrived for a four-day visit, opening a LatinAmerican tour which includes Bolivia and Guatemala. He heldbrief talks on Sunday with Brazilian President Jose Sarneyduring a stopover in Brasilia. REUTER&#3;
