The European Community (EC) haseffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open itsmarket to imports before it decides on possible toughretaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives ofmember states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some ECpledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposingstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japaneseexports.    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would bediscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministerson April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepareproposals for possible retaliatory action.    They said the commission has powers to take some limitedaction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japaneseexports of electrical, photographic and other goods beingdiverted to Europe in the wake of possible U.S. Tariff moves.    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how toprevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as aresult of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obligesthem gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.    Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus with the Community hasgrown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch. REUTER&#3;
