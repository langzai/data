A key U.S. lawmaker in the securitiesfield said the insider trading scandal gripping Wall Streetreflects the attitude of the Reagan administration.    "They don't ask the question, 'Is it right or is it wrong?'They ask the question, 'Can you pull it off?'" Rep Edward Markey(D-Mass) told a state securities administrators meeting here.    Markey, Chairman of the House telecommunications andfinance subcommittee which oversees U.S. securities markets,said this ethic permeated Wall Street as well as the Reaganadministration.    He cited as examples a number of administration officialstainted by charges of wrongdoing including ex-Reagan advisorMichael Deaver, former national security aide John Poindexterand former Environmental Protection Agency official RitaLavelle.    Some Wall Street critics have blamed the insider tradingscandal on the so-called "Yuppie mentality", in which youngprofessionals strive for financial reward and neglect socialvalues.    But Markey said the inspiration for this attitude came fromthe administration. Reuter&#3;
