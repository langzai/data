Pakistan's decision to suspend teaimport licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short termwhile exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobibroking houses and exporters said.    Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colomboyesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences inorder to link tea imports to Pakistani exports.    The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports toPakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, whileimports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenyaprovides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports.    The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did notcome as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of thetrade imbalance for some time.    "We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ...(it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short termas Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market," a source at onebroking house told Reuters.    One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affectedKenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an averagefall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasalast Monday.    "The trend is likely to continue until other countriesreplace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,"he added.    Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan,Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as majormarkets for its tea, the sources added.    Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan wouldbe worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longerto find new outlets, they said. REUTER&#3;
