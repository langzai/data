Moody's Investors Service Inc said itmay downgrade Duquesne Light Co's two billion dlrs of debt.    Moody's said it would assess the likely financialconsequences of the 19 mln dlr rate reduction ordered today bythe Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.    The unexpected order raises significant doubts about thequality of Duquesne's regulatory support and financialprospects. The Commission's determination that Perry Unit 1'spower is not needed could depress Duquesne's earnings and cashflow well into the future. Duqusne has Baa-1 senior debt andpreferred stock and Baa-2 debentures and preference stock. Reuter&#3;
