A group controlled by EquitableBancorp Chairman Alfred Lerner said it has acquired a 9.6 pctstake in AmeriTrust Corp &lt;AMTR> and may buy up to 24.9 pct ifobtains regulatory approval.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,the group said it bought its stake of 2.0 mln Ameritrust commonshares, for 81.1 mln dlrs as an investment.    But the group, acting through Clevebaco L.P., a Clevelandpartnership, also said it would seek regulatory approval toincrease its stake. Lerner owns Clevebaco Corp, which is thegeneral partner of Clevebaco L.P.    The Lerner group said it filed with the Federal ReserveBoard on March 13 notice of its intent to buy more than 10 pctof the common stock of AmeriTrust, a Cleveland bank holdingcompany.    If the Fed approves, Lerner, whose Equitable Bancorp isalso in Cleveland, said he intends to buy more AmeriTruststock, subject to market conditions and other factors.    Since Lerner heads a bank holding company with assetsgreater than one billion dlrs, he said he is barred by law fromserving as a director or officer of AmeriTrust or of having hisrepresentatives on its board.    Lerner said he has no intention of influencing AmeriTrustmanagement or its policies.    The group said Clevebaco L.P. bought one mln of its sharesfrom Bear, Stearns and Co Inc on March 9 at 41 dlrs a share.    Lerner said he accumulated the other one mln shares throughMarch 3 and sold them to Clevebaco L.P., which he controls, onMarch 10 for 40.10 dlrs a share. Reuter&#3;
