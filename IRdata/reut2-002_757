In an interview with the Globo television network,transmitted from Rome, Funaro said the reception byrepresentatives of creditor countries with whom he met alongthe week was always to seek new ways.    "Brazil made several adjustments in its economy in the pastwhich affected the goodwill of its people. We now wish to keepthe country's growth in order to be able to face the problemsof the future," Funaro said.    The minister said that he had proposed a "four-year plan" tothe creditors, which would include a rescaling of thecommitments derived from its debt.
