A judge ruled that questions ofliability in the 1985 crash of a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747which killed 520 people near Tokyo will be decided in Seattle.    But he left open the possibility that monetary damagescould be awarded in a Japanese court.    The ruling, by King County Superior Court Judge GaryRittle, came in a hearing on lawsuits in which survivors of 77of the victims are seeking millions of dollars in compensation.    Rittle said after the liability problems are settled, hewill examine the question of where damages will be decided.    Lawyers for both the airline and the Seattle-based BoeingCo (BA.N> argued that the suits should be handled in a Japanesecourt, saying it would be more costly and time-consuming tohear them in an American court.    But lawyers for the victims' survivors said the twocompanies were trying to evade the liability question andreduce the amount of compensation they may have to pay.    Court officials said the case was likely to go to trialhere in eight to 10 months.    A draft report by a Japanese Transport Ministryinvestigation team said faulty repairs in 1978 by Boeing andinadequate inspection by ministry inspectors had contributed tothe cause of the disaster.    The report, obtained by Reuters this week, is expected tobe made public next month. Boeing has said it will probably notcomment on the report until it is officially released. REUTER&#3;
