Portugal's minority centre-rightgovernment was ousted in a parliamentary censure vote backed bythree left-wing opposition parties.    The Socialist Party (PS), Democratic Renewal Party (PRD)and Communist Party (PCP), who held 140 of the 250 parliamentseats, voted for the motion against the Social Democratic Party(PSD) government and their Christian Democrat allies.    President Mario Soares, who returns from a visit to Brazilon Sunday, was now faced with the task of either forming a newgovernment or calling an early general election. Reuter&#3;
