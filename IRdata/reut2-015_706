A further cut in West German taxes toovercome the current weakness of the domestic economy has beencalled for by Thomas Wegscheider, management board chairman ofBank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG.    He said in  an interview due in tomorrow's Die Weltnewspaper that tax cuts already decided by the governmentshould be expanded by implementation of the "Stability Law,"which allows tax cuts of up to 10 pct for a limited period.    Wegscheider also said a temporary rise in state borrowingresulting from such cuts would be tolerable, according toexcerpts of his remarks released early by Die Welt.    In line with a pledge made at the Paris monetary conferencein February, the government announced in March that 5.2 billionmarks worth of tax cuts would be added on to reductions of somenine billion marks already scheduled for next year.    Wegscheider said the Bundesbank should pursue its policiesaimed at lower interest rates and said a reduction in moneymarket rates could encourage private capital market investment.    Earlier today the Bundesbank's vice-president HelmutSchlesinger said the central bank saw no current reason tochange its monetary course. REUTER&#3;
