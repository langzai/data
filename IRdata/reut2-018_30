The House Agriculture Committee votedto make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiencypayments immediately instead of in the late fall.    A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senatefloor last week.    The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allowso-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather thanlate this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would notbe changed.    Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spendinginto fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected tomeet stiff resistance in the full House. Reuter&#3;
