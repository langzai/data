The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said itaccepted an economic offer from the Canadian division ofGeneral Motors Corp &lt;GM> in contract negotiations.    But union president Bob White said many local issues at the11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved aheadof Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.    "It minimizes the possibility of a strike," White toldreporters.    However, "if we don't have local agreements settled byThursday, there will be a strike," he said.    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,skilled trades and job classifications, White said.    GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strikewould be avoided.    "Even though there are some tough issues to be resolvedwe're on the right schedule to meet the target," Curd said.    "I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations," hesaid.    Union membership meetings have been scheduled for theweekend in case a tentative settlement, said White.    White said the union has also received assurances that ajob protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. doesnot threaten Canadian jobs.    The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matchesagreements at Ford &lt;F> and Chrysler &lt;C> in Canada, whichinclude inflation-indexed payments for future retirees andfixed annual payments for current retirees.    It also gives workers wage increases of three pctimmediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years. Reuter&#3;
