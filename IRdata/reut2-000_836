The Philippines must devalue the peso ifit wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic PlanningSecretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.    "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exportsmore competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question aboutit. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, SouthKorea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economiesdeliberately undervalued their currencies."    The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It iscurrently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government doesnot intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible andable to continue to respond to market conditions.    Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate fromthe point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher,our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so thefinancing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at itin terms of the economy."    She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.    "I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it tobecome uncompetitive because then we are dead."    Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate isa movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmeticthing."    Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pctin calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it wasexpected to touch five pct this year.    He said the government and the International Monetary Fundhad set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.    The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to thedollar when it was floated in 1984. REUTER&#3;
