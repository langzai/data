Remarks by Japan's Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed tostabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late toinfluence currency trading, dealers said.    After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yenfrom an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finishof 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,they said.    "I think (Nakasone's) desperate," said a U.S. Bank foreignexchange manager.    Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliamentthat Japan and other industrialized nations committedthemselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above150 yen.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committeethat the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. AndWest Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollarfell below 150 yen.    "His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and shouldhave had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150yen," said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust.    Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  andis likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145yen.    Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S.And Japan will continue to depress the dollar.    The trade issue has now become a political issue since theReagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress overth3pYgks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr tradedeficit, they said. REUTER&#3;
