Israel's central bank said in itsannual report the country made striking gains in 1986 under anausterity program, but warned a national election campaigncould harm the economy.    Elections are due by November 1988, but tension within thegovernment over a Middle East peace conference has led manypolitical analysts to predict the government may fall earlier.    Bank of Israel governor Michael Bruno told a newsconference the austerity since July 1985 had balanced thenational budget for the first time in 15 years, and pushedinflation from 400 pct a year to just below 20 pct in 1986.    But Bruno warned that if politicians followed their pastpractice of lifting customs duties and increasing governmentsubsidies on basic goods in order to curry public favour duringelections, the gains of the program could be lost.    "The great success of the national unity government inexecuting the economic programme ... Depends on its ability toshow proper judgement towards economic issues also whenelections are on the horizon," Bruno said.    He blamed a 12 pct rise in real wages in 1986 for a sharpincrease in private consumption, and said higher pay washarming attempts to push inflation to under 10 pct a year.    "The lowering of inflation was one of the striking successesof 1986," Bruno said.    "It is important to note that in this area of economicstability we still have to tread a delicate path to reach anannualised inflation rate of 10 pct in the second half of thisyear," he said. He added that this was achievable.    The Bank's report said Israel's gross domestic product grewby 2.2 pct in 1986. The business GDP, which most economistsview as a better indicator of economic growth, rose by 3.7 pct. REUTER&#3;
