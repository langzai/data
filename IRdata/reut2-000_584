Ford Motor Co's program to introduceair-bags in its compact cars is facing widespread resistancefrom both consumers and dealers, a trade paper said.    As of February 20, Automotive News said Ford dealers hadsold only 455 1987-model Ford Tempos equipped with airbags and294 similarly-equipped Mercury Topaz models compared with morethan 100,000 of the standard-equipped compact models.    Ford has projected output of 12,000 Tempo and Topaz modelsequipped with airbags in the 1987 model year, but AutomotiveNews said the current inventory of unsold cars represents adisastrously high 1-1/2-year supply at current selling rates.    Most of Ford's sales of the compact cars equipped with airbags have been made to fleet buyers such as the U.S.government, the paper said, with 11,000 having been sold sincethey were announced in late 1985.    Ford executives recently said their goal is to sellannually between 500,000 and one mln cars equipped with airbags by 1990 if the federal government will relax certainregulatory standards as has been urged by some traffic safetyadministrative staff.
