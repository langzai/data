Canada's softwood lumber will becomeunprofitable for some forest product producers if pricesdecline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of twoby four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman toldreporters.    Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a moveby Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct exporttax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for aU.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervailduty.    "I think that there has been a falling off in the market, soI think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,"Zimmerman said at a media briefing.    Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumberproduct prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canadafirst, migrating westward.    "The country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go offwhen times get tough," Zimmerman said.    He also said the federal government should maintain theexisting 15 pct export tax and not allow provinces to offsetthe tax with increased provincial fees for cutting lumber. Reuter&#3;
