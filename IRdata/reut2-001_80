The collapse of International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes theimmediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing thecustoms service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.    The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislationoffered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffeeimports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. Abill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).    However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reachagreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is notimmediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of thecoffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.    "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.
