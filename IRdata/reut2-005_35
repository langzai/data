Retail sales of new cars by U.S.automakers eased 2.2 pct in early March to the weakest levelssince 1983, with industry giant General Motors Corp &lt;GM> down9.3 pct.    Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both had gains.    The decline by GM continued its trend of weaker sales sincethe beginning of the 1987 model year, which has forced theworld's biggest corporation to cut its car production severaltimes through temporary and permanent layoffs at variousplants.    Relatively weaker sales by all of the Detroit Big Threecarmakers have compelled the companies to offer a string ofsales incentives including cash rebates and below-marketinterest loans in an effort to reignite the market.    Incentives apparently had some success, analysts said, asthe seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate improved to 7.5mln compared with about 7.0 mln in late February.

GM's Buick division was alsoup, by 11.4 pct, while Cadillac was down 7.8 pct, Pontiac wasoff 10.8 pct and Oldsmobile plunged 41 pct.    GM also showed an improvement in its market share to 53.6pct from 48.1 pct in late February, which analysts said waspartly due to the increasing sales for the new Chevrolets.
