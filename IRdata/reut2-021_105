Recent announcements from Moscow ofnext year's grain production targets indicate that the Sovietsare estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,Agriculture Department analysts said.    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, butsome earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst ofSoviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article inIzvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."    "This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213mln tonne (grain) crop," the analyst said.       In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figurepublished in a Soviet economic journal this month.    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects arange of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvestprogress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agricultureofficial Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would beas good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mlntonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems wouldbring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes. Reuter&#3;
