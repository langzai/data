The Securities and ExchangeCommission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futureson designated foreign debt securities on U.S. exchanges.    The move would allow the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, toapply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, forapproval of a futures contract on yen bonds.    The CBT has said it may apply for approval of the yen bondfutures contract, a CFTC spokesman said.    The SEC's action, which was approved by a 4-0 vote,specifically removes a regulation against trading futures ondesignated foreign government debt securities on contractmarkets that are not located in the country that issued thosesecurities.    Futures on the government debt securities of Japan, Canadaand Great Britain can already be marketed in the United Statesunder a designated exemption issued by the SEC.    But the new move would permit U.S. exchanges to apply tothe CFTC for approval of establishing futures contracts onthose securities, SEC officials said.    The new SEC move would also allow those foreign governmentdebt securities to be marketed in the United States bycountries other than those that issued the securities, theofficials said.    Since the foreign government securities underlying thefutures cannot be traded in the United States unless they areregistered with the SEC, settlement and delivery of the futureswould often take place in the foreign country, the SECofficials said.    The SEC is also considering expanding futures trading ofadditional countries' government securities to be marketed andtraded in the United States, the officials said. Reuter&#3;
