U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionistresponse in the United States.    "Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and thecountry, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be veryconcerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) mightbe very serious," Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen.    Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand "totalelimination" of the beef import quota by April 1988.    The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor maystrengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyngsaid, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S.    Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan mightretaliate against U.S. products as a result of thesemiconductor dispute.    "They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us," Lyngsaid, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japanhas more to lose in a trade war than the United States.    Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanesebeef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choicein food purchases.    He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press foreliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice aswell.    Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farmproducts, principally grains and soybeans. Reuter&#3;
