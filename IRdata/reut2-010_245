Four major Japanese steelmakers plan toform a seamless pipe export cartel for markets other than theU.S. And the European Community for a year from April to keepprices above output costs, company officials involved said.    The companies are Nippon steel Corp &lt;NSTC.T>, SumitomoMetal Industries Ltd &lt;SMIT.T>, Nippon Kokan KK &lt;NKKT.T> andKawasaki Steel Corp &lt;KAWS.T>, which together account for some95 pct of Japan's total seamless pipe exports.    The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry today and approval is expectedlater this month, the officials said.    Under the plan, the four companies will set floor pricesfor exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yen'sappreciation against the dollar, reduced world demand caused bylower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted inprice-cutting competition, the officials said.    In calendar 1986, seamless pipe exports fell to 2.34 mlntonnes from 2.99 mln in 1985 and 3.12 mln in 1981.    The officials declined to give any idea of floor prices,saying it depends partly on volume, but industry sourcesestimate average export prices would rise by around 20 pct tosome 800 dlrs a tonne.
