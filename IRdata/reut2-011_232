&lt;British Caledonian Group>, Britain'ssecond largest airline, has announced a 19.3 mln stg pretaxloss for the financial year ending last October, compared witha record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman SirAdam Thomson told reporters.    A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terroristattacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyldisaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected MiddleEast traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.    He said the poor results were caused by "a range ofexceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control" andpredicted a return to profitability this year.    Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sellsome of its assets and cut the number of its flights across theAtlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business. REUTER&#3;
