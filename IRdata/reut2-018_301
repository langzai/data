Assistant Secretary of State ElliottAbrams said he was "completely honest and completely wrong" whenhe gave assurances last October that the U .S. government wasnot involved in a flight by a contra supply plane downed overNicaragua.    He was being questioned by the congressional Iran-contrapanel about testimony he gave to the House Foreign AffairsCommittee on October 15, 1986, saying no U.S. intelligence,defense or other government official was involved in theflight.    "I made those statements and I made a similar statement onOctober 14 to Secretary (of State George) Shultz. And every oneof those statements was completely honest and completely wrong,"Abrams testified.    Two of the crew of the downed aircraft, operating out of ElSalvador, were killed. The third, Eugene Hasenfus, wascaptured, tried and sentenced to 30 years' jail, but laterreleased by the Nicaraguan authorities.    Abrams -- the highest-ranking member of the administrationto testify in five weeks of televised hearings -- said he didnot remember how he learned that the plane had been shot down,but thought it was probably from the CIA.    He said he made public statements within a couple of daysthat there had been no U.S. government involvement after makinginquiries of the CIA, the National Security Council and thePentagon.    "Everybody said, not only then but later, that there was noU.S. government role," he said. Reuter&#3;
