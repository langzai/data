Fourteen of the 40 have been in Texas, which has been hardhit by plummeting oil prices.    The FDIC said it approved paying off the insured depositorsof the failed Plaza National Bank, Del Rio, Texas.    The bank, with assets of 34.8 mln dlrs, was closed today bythe U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.

Owners of the uninsured deposits will share with the FDICas the failed bank's assets are liquidated.
