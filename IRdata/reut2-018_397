Uruguayan suppliers have agreed to supplyTaiwan with only 25,000 tonnes of soybeans out of a total70,000 tonnes agreed in April, a spokesman for the jointcommittee of Taiwan's soybean importers told Reuters.    He said a rise in world prices had made the Uruguayansreluctant to ship any soybeans at the agreed price of 226.56U.S. Dlrs per tonne.    The Uruguayans agreed to supply part of the shipment afterthe Taiwan committee threatened last week to cancel the order,but they postponed delivery to July 1-20 from the original June5-25, the committee spokesman said.    Government sources in Montevideo confirmed that Uruguayangrain exporting firms would ask Taiwan to reconsider prices onthe soybeans but said the government would not intervene in thedispute.    "The deal was agreed to between two private companies,without any participation whatsoever from the Uruguayangovernment," Uruguyan Agriculture Ministry spokesman AndresBonino said.    He added, "Uruguay is not going to export 70,000 tonnes ofsoybeans, since total production this year has been lower thanthat figure."    The contract called for the Uruguayans to deliver the70,000 tonnes in two shipments between June 5 and August 10.    Taiwan's ambassador in Montevideo, Henry Wang, toldreporters, "Both countries are finishing details to arrive at asatisfactory price."    He said the price would be "very advantageous (for Uruguay)because it will be above the international price."    Taiwan bought some 36,000 tonnes of soybean last year,making it Uruguay's biggest customer for the oilseed.    Taiwan's joint committee holds a tender today for twoshipments of U.S. Soybeans totalling 87,000 tonnes. REUTER&#3;
