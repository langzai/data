Ecuador will resume limited crude outputnext week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oilto a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state EcuadoreanPetroleum Corp (CEPE) said.    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuadorwould begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude innortheastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week inpreparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up toneighbouring Colombia.    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when anearthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacificport of Balao.    It will take at least until the end of July to repair thepipeline and return output to normal levels. The country waspumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador isconstructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting pointof Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.    The original target date to resume limited crude output wasMay eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the LagoAgrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesmansaid. Reuter&#3;
