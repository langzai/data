U.S. Agriculture Departmentinspectors have refused entry to parts of two lots ofAustralian beef because of pesticide residues, a spokeswomanfor the department said.    She said USDA has notified Australia, which assured it thatstricter controls would be implemented.    The Australian government had already imposed residuecontrols and it is believed the meat with the presticideresidues was already in the pipeline before the controls wereput in place, the spokeswoman said.    There have been five other cases of Australian meat whichhad residue levels above U.S. allowable limits this year, shesaid. Reuter&#3;
