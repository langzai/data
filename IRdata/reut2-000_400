A Taiwan mission will leave next week forWashington to renegotiate an agreement severely limiting thegrowth of the island's textile exports, a Board of ForeignTrade official said.    Under the agreement signed last July, Taiwan's textileexport growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988,based on the value of 1985 exports.    The official said the pact was unfair because the UnitedStates had signed more favourable agreements with Hong Kong andSouth Korea. They were each given about one pct growth until1991.    He said Taiwan now found it difficult to compete with itstwo main rivals and the problem had been made worse because ofthe surging value of the Taiwan dollar. Reuter&#3;
