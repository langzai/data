The Commerce Department publishedrevisions to monthly data on factory orders indicating somesubstantial changes to published figures for recent months.    The revisions take account of several factors includingadjustments to unfilled orders levels, recalculation of neworders estimates and updating of seasonal adjustment factors,the department said.    As a result, December factory orders reported as rising 1.6pct rose on the revised basis by 3.2 pct, while November ordersreported as 3.6 pct were up only 0.8 pct on the revised basis,the department said.    Commerce has already reported January factory orders fell4.0 pct. The report on February orders is due next week andthat figure will be revised then.    The revisions, which cover the years 1982-1986, also affectthe key category of durable goods orders. The department saiddurables orders reported as 1.5 pct higher in December were up5.3 pct on the revised basis and November orders reported 5.1pct higher were up a revised 3.0 pct.    The department reported January durable goods orders fell7.5 pct and is scheduled to release February orders on Tuesdaymorning.    The January durable goods orders will be revised andFebruary orders reported on a basis consistent with therevisions, Commerce said.    For all of 1986, factory orders were originally reported asbeing unchanged from 1985 levels, but the department said afterrevisions orders fell 0.6 pct last year.    Among changes in the orders survey, the department said itwas changing inventory values to reflect current costs ratherthan book value of unsold goods. Reuter&#3;
