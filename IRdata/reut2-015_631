Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests. Reuter&#3;
