House Ways and Means Committeechairman Dan Rostenkowski said he was ready to support an 18billion dlr tax increase to help balance the budget but doubtedit could pass Congress without President Reagan's support.    Rostenkowski, the chief House taxwriter, said his committeewas reluctant to back a tax increase without certainty that itwould pass the full House and this would require Republicanvotes.    "Chairman Rostenkowski still says its an uphill fight unlessthe president signs on," the Illinois Democrat said in remarksfor delivery to the Tax Executives Institute.    Rostenkowski predicted the tax increase will concentrate onincreases in federal excise taxes while leaving the income taxintact.    The taxwriters will not consider delaying the income taxrate cuts for upper income persons scheduled to take effect in1988, he said. The top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pctnext year.    In addition, he said "they don't have the energy or appetiteto endorse a radical new tax like a VAT (value added tax),"which he also opposes. "The real question is where theRepublicans will be when the tough vote comes," he said.    Rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any taxcredits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax ortrade bill this year.    He added that no extension or expansion of the research anddevelopment tax credit for business is expected since it wouldcost billions of dollars.    And, Rostenkowski told the tax executives that Howard Bakeras Reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the WhiteHouse will ultimately back a tax increase this year. "There arestrong suspicions that the Baker boys will lead the presidentdown the slippery slope of moderation," he said. Reuter&#3;
