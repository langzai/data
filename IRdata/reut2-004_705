Dutch port and transport union, FNV,has called off the strikes against planned redundancies thathave hit Rotterdam port's general cargo sector for the pasteight weeks, strike leader Paul Rosenmuller told a massmeeting.    The decision followed yesterday's ruling by an Amsterdamcourt preventing the sector's employers continuing with currentplans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits againon May 7, Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargosector's 4,000 workers today.    The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in thecomplicated legal procedure for obtaining official permissionfor the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed.    "There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment nowthe immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted,"Rosenmuller said.    But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 inprotest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, couldresume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any movesto re-apply for permission for the redundancies.    SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said theywould be meeting their lawyers today with a view to re-applyingfor this permission next week in the hope of gaining approvalfor the redundancies within a month.
