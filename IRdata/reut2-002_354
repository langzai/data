He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe andthe United States, is the result of "confidence in thedirection this country is going in."    "That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today ishigher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (whenit was) a little over 69 cts," Wilson told the House of Commonsdaily question period.    Figures released this week show foreigners purchased arecord 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more thandouble the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5billion dlrs in the market.    Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about apossible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investmentabroad.
