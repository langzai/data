The Belgian National Bank said it cutone, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by0.10 points, effective immediately.    The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two monthrate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, thecentral bank said in a telex.    A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was madeafter a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, andwas not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pctdiscount rate.    The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especiallythe three-month rate, have been the National Bank's mainmonetary policy instrument for the last two years.    The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate ratherthan a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currentlylittle used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.    The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates onJune 5, also by 0.10 points. REUTER&#3;
