Sales of U.S.-made cars duringmid-March, the traditional start of the spring selling season,dropped 3.9 pct behind last year's level, analysts say.    Automakers sold about 204,000 cars in the March 11-20selling period, 10,000 fewer than last year. Analysts said thedecline may auger poorly for the rest of the spring season.    Buyers shied away from the showrooms of American MotorsCorp &lt;AMO>, the target of a 1.5 billion dlr takeover bid fromChrysler Corp &lt;C>. Analysts said consumers were anxious aboutthe whether Chrysler will retain some American Motors models,causing a 62 pct drop in American Motors sales in mid-March.    Chrysler's mid-March sales fell 3.6 pct.    "During the spring selling season, you usually look forsome kind of seasonal uplift in sales. It doesn't look likeit's happening," said Joseph Philippi, analyst with E.F. Huttonand Co.    "There may be less bloom to the spring selling season thisyear than last," one auto company official conceded.    General Motors Corp &lt;GM>, still working to regain consumerinterest in its cars, led the drop with a 14.8 pct decline.    Ford Motor Co's &lt;F> sales increased 15.2 pct for theperiod. But analysts said the rise compares to a 1986 periodfor Ford, leaving it down 10 pct in two years.    "The total industry (mid-March sales) was slightly lessthan expected," the company official said.    American Motors' decline caught analysts eye. "AmericanMotors took it on the chin--big," said Philippi.    Given the prospective takeover by Chrysler, "people mightbe a little leary about going to (American Motors) dealers," hesaid.    American Motors sold 790 domestic cars in the period,meaning each of American Motors 1,050 dealers "is selling a carabout every other day," Philippi said.    Potential American Motors buyers are afraid their carmodels "might disappear," he said.    Chrysler, in its purchase agreement with American Motors'majority stockholder &lt;Renault>, has agreed not to undercutsales of American Motors' new Medallion and Premier cars, madeby Renault.    On a company by company basis, sales of U.S. made cars fromthe March 11 to 20 period were--GM 105,438, down 14.8 pct, Ford67,672, up 15.2 pct, Chrysler 30,909, down 3.6 pct, AmericanMotors 790, down 6.2 pct, American Honda 7,447 compared with5,031, Nissan Motor Corp, 3,358, up 10.7 pct, Volkswagon U.S.Inc 1,330, down 35 pct.
