West Germany takes "very seriously" therecent undertaking by major industrial countries to promoteexchange rate stability around current levels, Finance MinistryState Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.    Talking to journalists before a meeting of EuropeanCommunity Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyerdeclined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by theGroup of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreementsfor stabilising currencies.    But he noted the official communique said the participantsagreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchangerates around current levels. "We're taking this sentence veryseriously," he said.    Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved againstthe mark since the meeting.    He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had beencaused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Parisagreement should help in this respect.    Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said theBonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster theeconomy but was paying close attention to the slower growth andhad not ruled out "appropriate and timely" action if necessary.    Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussionby the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on theeconomic situation in the 12-nation bloc.    The Commission has sharply revised down expected Germangross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pctpredicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any ECcountry to stimulate economic activity.    Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowedin the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend inview that would make quick remedial action necessary.    He said a number of favourable indicators such as highlevel of investment and a good climate for consumption meant arecovery could be expected, while exports would pick upslightly during the course of the year.
