Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> said that the orderfor McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD> MD-11 long haul jets confirmedthis morning was worth a total 1.2 billion Swiss francs.    President Robert Staubli told a news conference it had notyet been decided whether the planes would have General ElectricCo &lt;GE.N>, Pratt and Whitney &lt;UTX> or Rolls Royce engines.    The airline said it chose the U.S. Plane rather than therival A-340 of the European Airbus consortium because it metbetter the Swissair requirements and would be able to enterservice in 1990 giving a smooth transition from the DC-10s itreplaces.    Staubli said Swissair planned to have replaced its wholefleet of 11 DC10s by 1992 at the latest, entailing the order offive more long-haul planes in addition to the six announcedtoday. He said it would decide on the basis of the developmentof traffic whether these five would be MD-11s or Boeing 747s.    However, Staubli ruled out the possibility that Swissairmight eventually choose A-340s. "We cannot afford to operatethree different types of aircraft," he said.    Swissair also had no short term plans to exercise itsoption to buy Airbus A-310s, of which it already operates nine,officials said. But it would still hold the options open.    Staubli declined to say how much it paid for each of theMD-11s. The total 1.2 billion franc figure was not only for theplanes but also for spare parts and other related expenditure.    Company officials said that Swissair intended to coveraround 75 pct of the costs of its entire DC-10 replacementprogramme with internally generated funds. It hopes to raisethe remaining 25 pct on the Swiss and other capital marketsthrough issuing straight or equity related bonds and/or througha capital increase.    The first such bond issue would likely come this year, theypredicted. REUTER&#3;
