General Acquisition Co said it wasdisappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer andquestioned how the company might give better value toshareholders.    Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr pershare tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagnerand Brown and AFG Industries Inc. The company said it wasstudying financially superior alternatives.   The partnership called the response inflammatory andunproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discussthe offer with Gencorp.     The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it wouldprovide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt toprevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poisonpill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that maketakeovers more expensive.    Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date itsrights will trade separately from the common stock was extendedto April six from April three. It said the extension wassubject to further extensions by the board and is conditionedon no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more ofGencorp prior to April six.    General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can becompleted in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.    The partnership in its statement again urged management towork with it to facilitate a transaction.    Reuter&#3;
