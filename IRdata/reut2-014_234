In a letter to the commission detailing actions taken as aresult of that order, the utility said the Operations Engineerhad been reassigned to corporate headquarters on April 6.    Releasing its letter to the NRC, Philadelphia Electric saidit "will have no future comment on this response pendingNuclear Regulatory Commission disposition" of the case.    Effective April 11, the utility said, it is establishing24-hour coverage of operations by at least one independent,nuclear experienced engineer or physicist per shift postedwithin the control room complex who will report directly to thecompany's Superintendent of Nuclear Operations QualityAssurance Division at corporate headquarters.
