WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management,Pesch, the closely held health care and investment concerncontrolled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch, and other AMIshareholders.    It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues --selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try-- were discussed with which group.
