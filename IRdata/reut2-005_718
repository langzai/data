Finland's Conservatives emerged withmajor general election gains after a swing away from the left.    Conservative Party leader Ilkka Suominen told reporters"they can't keep us out of government now" after the Party gainednine Parliamentary seats in elections held on Sunday andMonday, taking its total to 53 seats.    With 99 pct of votes counted, Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa'sSocial Democratic Party had lost just one seat despite a 2.5pct drop in support.    The Social Democrats held 57 seats in the last 200-seatparliament, the Conservatives 44 and the Centre Party 37.    It may take weeks for the political complexion of the newgovernment to take shape as major parties negotiate to seewhich grouping can form a majority. But the result is expectedto be a change from the outgoing centre-left coalition.    Political commentators said the results will havefar-reaching implications as they showed a significant swingfrom the left, which has dominated post-war Finnish politics.    Despite the Conservative revival, commentators said therewould be no immediate change in foreign policy, which ismoulded by Finland's sensitive position in the shadow of theneighbouring Soviet Union.    The environmentalist "Greens" doubled their seats inparliament to four, although opinion polls had forecast theywould win 10.    The Communists split for the first time into pro-MoscowStalinists and Eurocommunists. The Eurocommunists retainedtheir 17 seats, while the Stalinists, expelled from theofficial Communist Party in 1986, lost six of their 10 seats. REUTER&#3;
