The Senate this week might take upproposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod toexpose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy.    The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that wouldallow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pctof their income support payments if flooding last yearprevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987crops, Senate staff members told Reuters.    Also pending is a bill extend the life of the NationalCommission on Dairy Policy.    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendmentto one of the bills that would suspend the minimum plantingrequirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and riceproducers, an aide said.    Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct oftheir base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of theirdeficiency payments.    Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard againstmaking any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out offear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems tobudget-cutting pressures.    Representatives of these farm groups have said they alsofear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on abill that would require large acreage set-asides in return forsharply higher support prices.    However, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sponsor of the bill, toldReuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a flooramendment but to bring it through the committee. Reuter&#3;
