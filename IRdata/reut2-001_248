Assistant Treasury Secretary DavidMulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavilyindebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help easetheir debt burden.    "In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equityor local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debtrelief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined withmeasures to encourage new equity investment and therepatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommitteeon International Development Institutions.    Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions tothe debt problems effecting many developing countries, rangingfrom debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutionsfor lending.    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, theyare impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said.    He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effectivebecause they eliminate the interest service on converted debt,create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that canhelp indebted countries overcome their own problems.
