The United Auto Workers and AmericanMotors Corp agreed to resume talks on a new labor contract forthe company's threatened Kenosha, Wisc. assembly plant despitea breakdown in talks last weekend, UAW vice-president MarcStepp said.    Stepp told reporters that issues which caused the talks tobreak off are being discussed between the two sides and that amain table bargaining session has been scheduled Friday inMilwaukee.    France's Regie Nationale des Usines Renault has acontrolling stake in American Motors.    Stepp said the union intends "to exert full efforts" toreach an agreement that would keep the plant in operation past1989, when AMC has said production will end unless the UAWgrants concessions on labor costs.    The UAW leader said the company and the union agreed inprinciple in 1985 to pattern a future contract covering some6,000 Kenosha workers after lower-cost UAW contracts coveringMazda Motor Corp's new U.S. plant in Michigan and the NewUnited Motor plant in California operated by Toyota.    Stepp said there is such deep hostility between the companyand union locals in Milwaukee and Kenosha that communicationbetween them is very difficult.    But he said it is possible to reach agreement on a newcontract to save the jobs of UAW members at AMC's Wisconsinoperations despite the impasse.    AMC has said it will resume talks, but only for 24 hours toascertain whether the union was willing to agree to theconcessions it wants.    The Kenosha plant builds AMC's Renault cars and a line ofChrysler Corp &lt;C> vehicles under a contract assembly deal. Reuter&#3;
