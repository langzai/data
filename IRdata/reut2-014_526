Finland's national oil company Neste Oy&lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firmsto study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.    The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mlnCanadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether(MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.    The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese CanadaInc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe LineCompany Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materialsavailability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and theimportant capital and operating advantages gained by locatingon an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plantproducing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancerthat can replace tetra ethyl lead.    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United Stateswhere lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because ofhealth concerns, the statement added.    Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as theU.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination inCanada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,it said.    Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over fivebillion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has amajor investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.    The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go onstream in late 1989, the statement said. REUTER&#3;
