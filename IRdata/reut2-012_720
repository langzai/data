A top Japanese official has insisted thatthe country was living up to its microchip pact with the US.    "It cannot be thought, nor should it be thought, we aretrying to dominate semiconductors," Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry (MITI) vice minister Makoto Kuroda said in anewspaper interview.    Kuroda, who will head a Japanese team going to Washingtonnext week for emergency talks on semiconductors, told the TokyoShimbun that he would try his best to convince the UnitedStates of Japan's case.     Washington last week announced an imposition of tariffs onJapanese electronic products in retaliation for what it sees asTokyo's failure to abide by the pact. Under the agreement Japanwould stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and try tobuy more American chips.    Kuroda told the newspaper that Tokyo has already takenmeasures to back up the pact, including production cutbacks.    While Japanese users are trying to increase chip imports,Tokyo cannot guarantee the United States a specified share ofwhat in Japan is a free market, he said. REUTER&#3;
