Senate Finance Committee ChairmanLloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries tomake a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cutinterest rates.    "I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to betrying to do is to get the other major industrial nations thatare involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"Bentsen told NBC Television's "Meet the Press."    Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take "billions offthe debt service of the Latin countries" and help easeprotectionist pressures in the industrial countries.    Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured torevalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.    "You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperationthere," he said.    Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told thesame television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had notfallen enough against the currencies of some countries.    "I think that more does have to be done there innegotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs(newly industrialized countries)," he said.    Darman said such negotiations with newly industrializedcountries were underway privately.    Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agreeon a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22billion dlrs in new revenues.    The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would beconsidered by Congress, including an extension of the telephonetax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.    Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that itwould not happen without President Reagan's support.    Darman called for a "top level negotiation" between the WhiteHouse and Congress on a budget compromise that would includeasset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-classentitlement programs, "a reasonable, steady rate of growth indefense" and reform of the budget process.
