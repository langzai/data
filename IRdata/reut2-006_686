World food production over the next decadewill exceed population growth, but because of unequaldistribution, many parts of the world will go hungry, the U.N.Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said.    In a report to be considered by its agriculture committeeat a meeting later this month, FAO said: "The long term trendspoint towards a further polarisation of the world food system.    "Some regions and commodities will continue to be troubledby chronic surpluses that cannot find outlets...Some of thepoorer countries and regions will still be faced by thecombined problem of low nutritional levels, rapidly risingpopulations, inadequate growth in both food production andincomes...," FAO said.    FAO set out several long-term goals to be considered by thecommittee, which meets between March 23 and April 1.    These included improving the international tradingenvironment for agricutural commodities, reducing foodsurpluses in developed countries, conserving natural resourcesand speeding up the increase of food production in developingcountries.
