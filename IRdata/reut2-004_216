David Rockefeller, chairman of theinternational advisory committee of Chase Manhattan Bank NA,said an accommodation would be found between Brazil and itscommercial bank creditors to solve the problem of the nation'srecent interest payment halt.    "I think one will find that the banking community, theBrazilian government and the international banking authoritieswill be talking for the next several weeks and I am veryhopeful that we would find an accommodation." Rockefeller toldbankers at a luncheon.    Brazil announced on February 20 that it was suspendinginterest repayments on about 68 billion dlrs of private sectordebt owed to commercial banks.    Rockefeller said the recent tour by Brazilian FinanceMinister Dilson Funaro of major industrial nations was a signthat Brazil wanted to be cooperative. But it was notable thatFunaro did not meet with the creditors immediately affected,the commercial bankers, he added.    Brazil's moratorium on commercial debt becomes critical byend-May, when payments would be 90 days overdue, obliging U.S.Regulators to downgrade Brazilian debt, financial sources said.    This would require banks in turn to cease accruing interestand set aside expensive loan loss reserves.    Rockefeller reminded bankers of the depth of concern overLatin American debt at the Toronto World Bank/InternationalMonetary Fund meeting in 1982, and said an accord would bereached in the current circumstances just as it had been then.    "(Brazilian authorities) have no more interest in seeingtheir credit sources cut off then we have in seeing theirobligations stop," he added. REUTER&#3;
