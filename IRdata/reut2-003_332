Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said thegovernment was considering selling Petro-Canada and the salewould proceed if it were in the national interest to do so.    Mulroney told the House of Commons assets of the huge oilcompany would be examined before a decision was made, just asother state-run companies were studied before being sold underOttawa's privatization program.    "The government is going to examine assets of this natureto ascertain if they continue to play an appropriate role inpublic policy and we will make a determination as we have inother cases," Mulroney told the daily question period.             Asked by opposition members to clairify Finance MinisterMichael Wilson's statement on Friday that Petro-Canada nolonger has any pubilic policy role, Mulroney said hisgovernment has long promised to sell off companies that couldbe better run by the private sector.    Outside the House, Energy Minister Marcel Masse saidPetro-Canada would be worth between three and four billion dlrsand, because of the size, could be difficult to sell.    He also said he would prefer to see Canadians participatingin any privatization, but would not give any details on timingof a sale.           Reuter&#3;
