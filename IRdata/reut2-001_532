Governor Cuomo said the agreement with Con Ed, which mustbe approved by the State Public Service Commission, wasnegotiated by the State Consumer Protection Board, PublicServcice commission Trial Staff, the State Attorney General,the City of New York and several other parties.    He said the agreement "will produce the first base eldctricrate decrease for Con Edison in more than 20 years.
