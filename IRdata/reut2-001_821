Opportunities for medium-sized banks tocompete in the face of the increasing centralization of thefinancial services industry may be dwindling, according to JohnRau, president of the Exchange National Bank of Chicago.    "We're going to see a continued shaking-out of the bankingindustry," Rau told Reuters after a speech to securitiesanalysts and investment advisors.    Rau said Exchange National Bank has concentrated itsresources on financial services for medium-sized Chicago andMidwest businesses, asset-based lending to middle-marketcompanies, and sales and trading of financial services.        "Most commercial banks depend on relatively low costconsumer deposits for their income. We decided to move ourfranchise into a less susceptible niche," Rau said.    "Nichemanship is a very difficult thing, especially inurban areas where inevitably banking franchises are mass-marketoriented," Rau said. "The odds are against other banks doingwhat we have done."    Exchange National Bank is the principal subsidiary of TheExchange International Corp. With total assets of 1.9 billiondlrs, it is Chicago's fifth largest bank. Net income totalled10.2 mln dlrs or 1.10 dlrs a share in 1986, up from 7.7 mlndlrs or one dlr a share in 1985. Reuter&#3;
