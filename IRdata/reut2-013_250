Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency said.    Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by aroundone pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,the IEA said in its latest monthly report.    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if averageconsumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth forthese fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.    The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain narcurrent levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.    If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some ofthe market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECDarea at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. Thisis about the same as at the begining of the year.    The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.    The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with company stocks rising, more or less in linewith consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.    Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were putat 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January oneand equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, downfrom the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to94 days of consumption.    The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that companystocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the firstquarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd inMarch.    And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said.    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have alsobeen a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, theIEA said.    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by abouttwo bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpdin January and to the seasonal drop in exports from CentrallyPlanned Economies, the IEA said.    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the firstquarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three monthsof 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd asagainst 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largestfactor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter&#3;
