A key U.S. House member said heopposed a Reagan administration plan to shift the cost ofsurveillance of futures exchanges to the private sector.    "I just think user fees are the wrong way to attack aproblem of this sort," said Rep. Ed Jones (D-Tenn.), chairmanof the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Creditand Rural Development.    The White House budget office has asked the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, CFTC, to draw up a plan fortransferring the three-mln dlr cost of monitoring futurestrading to either exchanges, futures commission merchants orusers of the markets.    CFTC Commissioner William Seale said the proposal was amove in the wrong direction. "I would prefer to see(surveillance) paid for through the appropriations processrather than through taxation of market participants," he said.    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips told the panel the commissionwas preparing the proposal, due to be completed April 15, atthe request of the Office of Management and Budget. Reuter&#3;
