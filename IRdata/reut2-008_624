The 1992 deadline for abolishing economicbarriers within the European Community should help Frencheconomic growth and create jobs, president of the Frenchemployers' federation CNPF Francois Perigot said.    "Having a market at our disposal which is as homogeneous andaccessible as that of Europe is an incredible piece of luck," hetold Le Figaro in an interview.    He said that the majority of French business leaders wereenthusiastic about the abolition of barriers and saw it as anopportunity rather than a danger for their companies.    "It can permit us to return to a growth rate which is muchbetter than we could achieve in isolation. We know that we haveto reestablish growth at three pct a year to solve the enormousproblems confronting us -- and I am referring mainly tounemployment," Perigot added.    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday thatFrench growth would be just two pct this year, the same as lastyear and compared with the government's original 2.8 pcttarget. REUTER&#3;
