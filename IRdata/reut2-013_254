U.S. Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige said the dispute between the U.S. And Japan overcomputer chips will not develop into a full-scale trade war.    "I think both sides will try and make sure that this doesn'tstart a trade war -- as a matter of fact I'm positive thatthere won't be a trade war with Japan," Baldrige said in atelevision interview.    President Reagan last week imposed penalties over Japan'salleged failure to adhere to a July 1986 agreement to stopselling semiconductors in third countries at below cost and toopen its own market to U.S.-made chips.    Despite Tokyo's displeasure with the penalties, Baldrigesaid Japan would refrain from taking retaliatory steps thatwould lead to a trade war, largely because Japan itself wouldhave the most to lose in such a conflict.    "Japan, I think will -- because they have the means to do it-- face up to the fact that as the second largest industrialtrading power in the world they have to live up to theirresponsibilities of free trade," he said.    "I think we'll work our way out of this," he added. "It's notgoing to be easy. But I guarantee you, we're not going to havea trade war." REUTER&#3;
