Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated anagreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of itsFairchild Semiconductor operations.    The company said the rising political controversy in theU.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale ofthe Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonabletime.    The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Departmentand the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national securitygrounds.    The company said termination of the agreement opened otherpossibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of thesemiconductor maker by Fairchild management.    In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoingbusiness within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concernsaid.    Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of theFairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge inthe fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended uprecording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourthquarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.    Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, butindustry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about200 mln dlrs.    The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservationsabout the transaction since it was announced.    Government officials have expressed concern that the salecould reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by puttingkey advanced technology into Japanese hands.
