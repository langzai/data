The African Development Bank plans toraise about 200 mln dlrs via a U.S. Domestic bond this year,Milan Kerno, vice president of finance said at a presentation.    He said the Bank planned to borrow about 700 mln dlrs inworld capital markets in 1987 and roughly the same amount in1988. Because of the weak condition of the euroyen market,plans for a bond in that sector, which would comprise part ofthe 700 mln dlrs,  have been put on hold, Kerno said.    "But we should complete our programme (this year), marketswilling," Kerno said, adding the Bank's 1987 borrowing so fartotaled about 400 mln dlrs.    The Bank's board of directors will meet on October 26 todiscuss plans to begin Bank trading in unspecified securities,with desks in Abidjan, Kerno said.    Trading would be conducted along similar lines as existingWorld Bank and Asian Development Bank operations, he said.    The Bank now has roughly 1.2 billion dlrs in availableliquidity to serve as a basis for trading, although not all ofthis will be traded at the start. The Bank plans to use thefunds gradually over the next three or four years, he said.    To facilitate lending increases the Bank tripled paid-incapital to about 18 billion dlrs from six billion in June.    German bankers at the presentation criticized the Bank forits overly conservative lending, adding the Bank would dobetter to invest more capital in loans. Total net equitycapital, consisting of subscribed capital and reserves, rose to1,282 pct of its funded debt in 1986 from 552 pct in 1985, theBank's statistics showed.    Other Bank figures from 1986 showed the InteramericanDevelopment Bank's net equity totaled 302 pct of funded debt,and the Asian Development Bank's 295 pct. Reuter&#3;
