Taiwan imposed currency controls todayin what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculationas the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency.    The strict controls will require proof that largeremittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactionsrather than currency speculation.    Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying theywere a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for fasterappreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar,which would slow exports to the United States.    Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports,shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need governmentapproval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs fromany other source.
