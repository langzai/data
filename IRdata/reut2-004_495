Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said severe problems remain in some sectors of the U.S.economy despite progress in others.    "Severe problems in some sectors of the economy are all tooobvious," he said in remarks prepared for delivery to aluncheon of business leaders here.    He said oil exploration and development, as well asagricultural prices, have been heavily affected by worldwidesurpluses.    Commercial construction, he said, is suffering from earlierover-building in many areas.    More broadly, he said, there are distortions and imbalancesin the U.S. economy that cut across many sectors.    "Unless dealt with effectively and forcibly, they willundermine all that has been achieved," Volcker warned.    He said one problem is that economic activity over the pasttwo years has been supported largely by consumption.    He said that rising consumption was achieved at the expenseof reduced personal savings. At the same time, he said, thehuge Federal budget deficit is absorbing a disproportionateamount of the savings generated in the U.S.    Volcker said the adverse consequences of the combination oflow savings rates and high Federal budget deficits have beenescaped by drawing on capital from abroad.    He noted that the net flow of foreign capital into the U.S.in 1986 exceeded all the savings by U.S. households.    "That is a graphic demonstration of the extent to whichour financial markets are hostage to possible changes inexternal attitudes and circumstances," Volcker said. Reuter&#3;
