Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcycourt will hear its request today for a restraining order tostop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by &lt;TransAmericanNatural Gas Corp>.    TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcyproceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuitto block Coastal from taking control.    Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, whichis an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present itsown reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court.    Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reservesand pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for anundisclosed amount.    TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company valuesits total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at aboutone billion dlrs.    The company, the second-largest natural gas producer inTexas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet andover 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.    About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spotmarket sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.    Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repayits 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. Thelawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and onebillion in punitive damages from Coastal.    Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas marketsince 1979, when it was forced to sell &lt;Lo-Vaca Gas GatheringCo> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texascustomers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.    Coastal, a natural gas producer and pipeline company,earned 71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion in 1986, abouthalf the its 1985 profits, due to slumping energy prices. REUTER&#3;
