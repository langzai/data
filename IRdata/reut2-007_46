The U.K. Treasury said its 1987/88budget arithmetic which was unveiled on Tuesday "took fullaccount of likely proceeds" from the sale of the government'sremaining 31.7 pct stake in British Petroleum Co PLC (BP.L).    A statement issued by the Treasury said "the BP announcementtherefore makes no difference to our estimate of privatisationproceeds in 1987/88, or to subsequent years, which remains 5.0billion stg a year."    "It makes no difference to the PSBR (Public Sector BorrowingRequirement) which the Chancellor set in the budget," it said.    "It has nothing to do with the future scope for tax cuts."    The Treasury's move was prompted by press speculation,officials said, which followed last night's surpriseannouncement by the government. It currently holds about 578.5mln shares in BP.    The Treasury statement said that the sell-off "is simply apart of the government's continuing privatisation programme,the overall size of which was announced in the Autumn(economic) Statement" (last November).    It said the BP proceeds "will be received in installments,of which the first will be in 1987/88."    News of the privatisation weighed down both BP's shareprice in London and the equity market overall, market sourcessaid.    The prospect of so much more BP paper in circulation hadcut BP shares at 1340 GMT to 824 pence from yesterday's Londonclose of 828 pence. The company's shares had been down as lowas 802 pence before rebounding, stock market sources said.    Worries over the ability of the London stock market todigest the BP and other privatisation issues sent the FinancialTimes/Stock Exchange 100 Share Index down 9.1 points by 1340GMT to 1997.5 from last night's close. At one point the indexwas as low as 1989.1, the sources said. REUTER&#3;
