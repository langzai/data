The massive stock market correction onWall Street will force a decline in Japanese share prices but adecline of similar proportions will not occur due to economicfactors, said Setsuya Tabuchi, chairman of the board of NomuraSecurities Co Ltd.    "There are less inflation worries in Japan and lesspossibility of interest rate rises," Tabuchi told reporters.    He also said Japan had a higher savings rate which providedmore funds for investment than was the case in other countries.    "If interest rates rise worldwide, Japan may raise thediscount rate, but the possibility of a Japanese rate increaseis smaller than in the U.S., Britain and West Germany," Tabuchisaid.    However, he noted that the Nikkei Dow stock index of theTokyo stock exchange and the Dow Jones Industrial average havemoved in tandem in the past four years.    The Dow fell 508 points to 1738 on Monday, its largestpercentage decline since the First World War.    The Tokyo index fell 620.18 to 25,746.56 on Monday, thesixth largest decline on record.
