The Agriculture Department must makea decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loanor more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to thegovernment and foreign soybean production will increase, thepresident of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.    "The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) asmuch as they want, but they have to eventually address thisproblem," David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters.    USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, andAgriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on thesoybean loan, Haggard said.    "I don't know if USDA is really very serious aboutaddressing the soybean loan problem," he said.    At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASAleaders refused to change their official position on the  loan-- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.    The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson,R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.    Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backedproposals have but said, "in all honesty, we do not want to seethe farm bill be torn apart."    He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition toa market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA couldchange the loan without new legislation.    Making the loan partially in certificates which would nothave to be paid back would be one option, he said. Reuter&#3;
