It said as part of the agreement, its current directinvestment in its existing non-consolidated joint venture withAjinomoto will be converted into a cooperative arrangement forthe long-term utilization of technology and trademarks.    The company said the change in the Japanese arrangementwill give Ajinomoto full equity ownership while leaving CPC acontinuing earnings stream and cash flow.    The transactions are subject to definitive agreements andgovernment approvals.    CPC said not included in the 340 mln dlr consideration areproceeds from the sale of some smaller Asian investments,including a 51 pct equity interest in an oat-based food ventureto an Australian partner.    The company said the actions being taken under itsrestructuring program, including the sale of its European cornwet milling business and other assets, overhead reductions andother expense items and the Asian transactions, will have aone-time positive effect on 1987 earnings.
