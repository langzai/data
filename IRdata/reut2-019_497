Canada has threatened to stop importsof Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinaryinspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danishagriculture ministry official told Reuters.    The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at therequest of the European Commission, which Denmark approachedfor support.    Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in aninterview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: "Denmark will notaccept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reachan understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC."    Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crownsin 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Communitytotalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.    Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicionthat the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by ECveterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.    But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen saidthe inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on ECregulations. "Canadian officials are very concerned about thetrade implications. We are holding active discussions with theEC and bilaterally," she added. REUTER&#3;
