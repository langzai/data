A forecast 379 mln N.Z. Dlr surplusin the government's 1987/88 budget will allow a significantreduction in the government debt program, Finance MinisterRoger Douglas said in a statement.    "There are however good reasons to maintain a higherborrowing program than the Budget numbers require," he said.    The government will borrow a further 950 mln dlrs thisfiscal year, down from the further 1.75 billion originallyplanned.    "The amount of foreign currency debt generated by previouseconomic mismanagement is too large," Douglas said. "It would notbe sensible when presented with an opportunity to repay somedebt to do so only in respect of domestic debt."    The government also has an interest in keeping enough of adomestic borrowing program going to keep the secondary marketefficient, he said. That will give the government betterborrowing terms in future, he added.    Douglas said the revised debt program also meant thegovernment would be able to retire over 650 mln dlrs ofdomestic debt and 600 mln dlrs of foreign debt. REUTER&#3;
