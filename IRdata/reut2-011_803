The restructured London Stock Exchangehas proved itself an unqualified success in less thansix months of operation, according to exchange chairman SirNicholas Goodison.    More than 95 pct of the business has left the trading floorand is now conducted in the offices of member firms, Goodisonsaid in remarks prepared for delivery in New York.    "Competitive bids and offers can now be seen on screens allover the country and business done is displayed on those samescreens," he said, reaching more investors than before.    Goodison said the new system has helped investors bypromoting greater competition that in turn has led to reducedcommissions and spread.    He said the exchange is now working on a small orderautomated execution system and a system to transfer securitieswithout certificates.    New laws to be enacted in full later this year will helpthe Securities and Investments Board investigate suspectedabuses and punish wrongdoing, Goodison said. He believes it isa misconception to say that the U.K. system of self-regulationis not as good as the U.S. system.    He noted that any violations of the rules are a criminaloffense. "There is no fifth amendment plea to offer a U.K.inspector hot on the trial of an insider dealer," Goodisonsaid, in a reference to the U.S. legal system which allowsindividuals to remain silent on the grounds that they mayincriminate themselves.    Goodison said a major goal of the London exchange is topersuade multinational corporations to seek a listing inLondon. He said about 200 U.S. companies are now listed inLondon, enhancing their ability to raise capital.    Reuter&#3;
