Ivory Coast rainfall this season hasbeen less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffeeproduction has not suffered, the official Ivorian dailyFraternite Matin reported.    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dryconditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant ifthere is good rainfall in coming weeks.    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowestin northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop hasespecially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matinsaid.    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier thismonth 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculturehad been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does notneed very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants havebeen affected in some regions, it added.    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It describedearly development of the new main crop as patchy.    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this yearforecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coastdue to drought in the western part of the country. It estimatedthe crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's4.33 mln bag harvest.    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffeecrop as "normal." REUTER&#3;
