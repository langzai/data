Peptide T, a minute chemicalstructure that can be easily manufactured, effectively blocksthe attack of the deadly AIDS virus on human cells, researchersclaimed.     The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health announced atthe third annual International Conference on Acquired ImmuneDeficiency Syndrome that Peptide T, first identified byinstitute neuro-scientist Dr. Candace Pert, "potently blocksentry of the AIDS virus into cells..."        The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has quickly approvedclinical testing of the naturally-occurring brain chemical. Thedecision  makes possible tests on AIDS victims.      Dr. Frederick Goodwin, the institute's scientificdirector, said in a joint interview with Pert, that "my gutreaction is that we are onto something."      He said that based on initial findings Peptide T may holdmore promise as a treatment for those already suffering fromAIDS, but could also have some value in the search for avaccine to prevent the spread of the disease.       A research team has found that Peptide T is capable offully reversing brain cell damage caused by AIDS under avariety of laboratory tests.    Pert said that she sent doses of Peptide T last autumn to aSwedish doctor who provided the chemical to four AIDS patients.One died, but the three survivors showed some improvement, shesaid.       Goodwin said that three major drug firms, which he declinedto identify, are anxious to win permission to produce thePeptide T substance that he said has potential for finding avaccine to safeguard against the deadly disease that hasthreatened the lives of over a million people thus far.    Pert said that the clinical testing in the United Stateswould involve at least a dozen AIDS patients in a controlledenvironment, probably starting next month, which wouldhopefully verify the chemical's usefulness.
