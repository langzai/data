Federal Deposit Insurance CorpChairman L. William Seidman told a bankers' meeting he thinksmore banks will follow Citicorp &lt;CCI> and Chase Manhattan &lt;CMB>in building up their reserves to meet Latin American debtproblems.    Seidman, speaking to an American Bankers Association tradeconference, said he did not think regulators would play as biga role in encouraging banks to build up their loan-lossreserves as the marketplace would.       My guess is that we as regulators won't become the keyfactor. I think the market system will get most of the otherbanks to follow suit," Seidman told some 3,000 executivesattending the ABA's National Operations and AutomationConference.    In the past two weeks, Citicorp has added three billiondlrs and Chase Manhattan, 1.6 billion dlrs, to their loan-lossreserves.       "I think that most banks are going to find it irresistibleto move forward on the same type of reserving because, if theydon't, their future earnings will be penalized as they hold uptheir reserves on a quarter-by-quarter basis," Seidman said.    He said Chase and Citibank, by setting aside huge amountsat one time,  have put their losses behind them and will showmuch better future earnings.    That, he said, will put pressure on more banks to followsuit. Reuter&#3;
