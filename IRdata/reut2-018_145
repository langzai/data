Finance Minister Edouard Balladur isundecided over his future in office after next Spring'spresidential election, his spokesman said.    "He (Balladur) has taken no definitive decision about hisactivities in a year's time," his spokesman said in answer to aReuters question.    He was responding to questions on a comment made byBalladur, a close political associate of right wing PrimeMinister Jacques Chirac, in a radio interview.    Balladur told a Radio Monte Carlo interviewer "From nextyear I shall rediscover the freedom of private life."    France is due to hold a presidential election in April orMay next year. Under the French political system, the primeminister and his cabinet tender their resignation to theincoming President, giving him freedom to appoint a newgovernment.    Chirac, leader of a two-party coalition government iswidely assumed to be a presidential candidate, while incumbentSocialist President Francois Mitterrand is tipped by mostopinion polls to win if he decides to stand again.    Balladur's stringent economic policies have come underincreasing criticism inside and outside the coalition partiesin recent months as official statistics and forecasts haveshown slowing growth prospects and rising inflation.    But the spokesman said Balladur was having no secondthoughts about the direction of his policies. "The Minister ofState (Balladur) has one current ambition, which is to achievehis mission of national economic recovery," he said.    "He refuses to prejudge the future a year from now." REUTER&#3;
