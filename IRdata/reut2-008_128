A 10 percentagepoint reduction in the Australian government's maximum crudeoil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,resources analyst Ian Story said here.    A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Straitoutput to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrelsper day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum ExplorationAssociation annual conference.    Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydneystockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.    Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longerappropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.    The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discoveredbefore September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty CoLtd &lt;BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp &lt;XON> partnership to shut-inproduction, accelerating the decline in output and reducinggovernment revenue, he said.    He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrsif the levy was cut to 70 pct.    "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractiveat oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said.    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higherlevels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boostexports and provide incentives for exploration and development,he said.    The government is currently reviewing the oil taxstructure. REUTER&#3;
