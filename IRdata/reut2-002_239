Federal Reserve Board Vice ChairmanManuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability wascritical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in theworld and said that progress was being made.    "It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve'spromotion of price stability is critical to the successfulimplementation of virtually all of the important ingredientsfor growth," he told the Eastern Economic Association.    Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety offronts. "Federal Reserve monetary policy, theGramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and theBaker debt initiative for example all have moved us in theright direction," he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.    On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precisenumerical goals was less important than a continuing commitmenttoward slowing the growth of federal spending.    There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross NationalProduct were declining and would continue to drop, he said.    But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreigncapital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keepinterest rates stable.    "This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessivefederal spending," he said.    A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be themain objective of the Fed, Johnson said.    He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment ofexchange rates was needed for long-term growth.    On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against "quick fix"solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciationor protectionist trade legislation.    "What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthyreturns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuineeconomic growth," he said.    Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allowfor its gradual resolution over time. Reuter&#3;
