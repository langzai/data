Guyana hopes to overcome its financialproblems within three to five years and is now seeking helpfrom donor governments, Finance Minister Carl Greenidge said.    He said Guyana took its problems in January to theCaribbean Group for Cooperation and Development, which includesgovernments and multilateral agencies, with a view to finding along-term recovery plan.    Guyana's arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)are now 70 mln dlrs and it would not be eligible for new loansin the near future, Greenidge told Reuters during theInter-American Development Bank (IADB) annual meeting here. MORE    Greenidge also said a World Bank mission would visitGeorgetown this week to assess prospects for a rescue plan thatwould enable Guyana to revive its economy. But he said thegovernment does not expect to be able to reduce its arrearsthis year.    Arrears to the IMF and the World Bank are projected to riseto 100 mln dlrs by the end of 1987. About 90 mln dlrs of this,equivalent to nearly half Guyana's annual exports, would beowed to the IMF.    "Expecting us to pay arrears is like asking a dying man togive a pint of blood," Greenidge said.    But Greenidge said Guyana has taken steps to reduce itsfiscal deficit, which now amounts to 65 pct of GDP. It hasincreased taxes, reduced public expenditure and refinanced itsinternal debt.    He said the World Bank would meanwhile look at investmentrequirements for potential export-earning projects such as goldmining, timber, oil and kaolin.    Because of its arrears, Guyana has been unable to draw downa 40 mln dlr World Bank loan for a bauxite industryrehabilitation project. Bauxite accounts for 90 mln dlrs ofexports, or 40 pct of the total. REUTER&#3;
