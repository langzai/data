An oil import fee could costconsumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-termU.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said.    The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that afive dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil importswould increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs ayear.    After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against thecosts, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee wouldhave a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cutthe federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energyconservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs wouldreduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domesticoil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.    "Any attempt to increase our energy security by limitingimports will actually reduce our long-run energy security byspeeding the depletion of domestic reserves," the study said.    The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domesticpetroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year,increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said.    Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistentlyopposed government regulation of the oil industry at the stateand federal levels.    "This study backs up my belief that government regulationand interference with competition hurt both the market andconsumers," FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement. Reuter&#3;
