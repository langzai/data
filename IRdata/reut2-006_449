Most of the cattle now being placed onU.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain onfeed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattleprices through the summer because of reduced beef supply.    The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for alonger time blunted the market impact of the high placementsreported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestockanalysts said.    After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed inseven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade hadexpected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.    Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts notedreports that many cattle put on feed were relativelylightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lightercattle into the autumn, rather than market them during thesummer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normallyplaced on feed.    Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult toobtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledgethat lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.    The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month fromFebruary, 1986.    University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimessaid, "The probabilities are high that in order to place thatmany cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go tolighter-weight cattle.    The only statistics available are from some terminalmarkets which represent only a small percentage of the totalcattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbsin February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.    Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.    If the average weight is down, and there is no priceweakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed atlighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much asthree pct.    Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerlyLBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainlybecause of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattleprices.    Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grainsupplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattleprices have been encouraging early movement of cattle fromwheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said.    Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheatpasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions.    Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann andGraham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trendis to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in hisarea benefited from a dry, mild winter.    To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter andsome cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs lessthan normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter. Reuter&#3;
