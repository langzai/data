Japan today announced another mammothmonthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure tointensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.    "The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for notmoving more quickly," Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economistEric Rasmussen said.    The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplussoared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion inJanuary and 4.77 billion a year ago.    The current account surplus, which includes trade inservices as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs lastmonth from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.    After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figureslook a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the tradesurplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs froma record 9.58 billion in January.    "In the medium term we expect this modest improvement tocontinue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward offfurther protectionism or further yen strength," said WilliamStirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.    A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive onworld markets while making imports into the country cheaper.    "On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making someprogress on getting exports down," Jardine's Rasmussen said.    But imports do not seem to be picking up much because theJapanese economy remains sluggish, he said.    Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slowerimport growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners workedoff stocks they had built up in January.    The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume ofexports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increasein January.    This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yenagainst the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impacton exports, they said.    But economists warned that may not be soon enough forJapan's trading partners. REUTER&#3;
