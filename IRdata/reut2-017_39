Japan's Lower House passed the 1987budget after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed to amediation proposal that could kill its plan to introduce acontroversial sales tax, political analysts said.    The move was seen as a major blow to Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, the leading advocate of the five pct tax.    Some analysts predicted Nakasone might be forced to stepdown just after the June summit of leaders from majorindustrial democracies, well before his one-year term is due toexpire at the end of October.    The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budgetbefore Nakasone leaves next week for the U.S. so that he couldtell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost toboost the sagging economy and imports.
