Bank of England governor RobinLeigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast couldjeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.    In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen inBirmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment aremore favourable, relative to those on financial assets, thanfor a good number of years.    "It would surely be foolish to put that favourableconjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely orexcessively," he said.    "We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at therisk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony ofhigh inflation," he added.    Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who wouldargue that interest rates are still too high and deterinvestment in industry.    "But we should not forget that less than a year ago we wereintervening to support sterling and had some temporarydifficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase inbase rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy atthe time," he added. Base rate is currently nine pct. REUTER&#3;
