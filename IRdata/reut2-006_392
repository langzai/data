Cable and Wireless PLC &lt;CAWL.L> and thePacific Telesis group &lt;PAC.N> may take part in a proposedmerger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan'sinternational telecommunications market, a senior industryofficial said.    Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee withthe Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told anews conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiumsagreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited toparticipate in the new merged firm.    The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that onlyone private company should enter the market.    The two consortiums, &lt;International Digital CommunicationsPlanning Inc> (IDC) and &lt;International Telecom Japan> (ITJ),were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly &lt;Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.    Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministrywanted only one competitor for the time being because of thesize of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreigninvestors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.    He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the mergedconsortium at less than three pct and added that even thelargest shareholders could own only some five pct .    Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house &lt;C. Itoh andCo.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium whilePacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. &lt;MER.N> jointlyhold 13 pct .    ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Severalfirms including Toyota Motor Corp. &lt;TOYO.T>  belong to both.    Watanabe said progress was being made towards a mergeragreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with thegovernment on having only one private consortium as twocompanies might invest "excessive" amounts.    He said talks with Cable &amp; Wireless will continue thisweek. REUTER&#3;
