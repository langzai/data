Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman HowardMacdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling itsstake in Dome Mines.    Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor EnergyCorp Ltd>, Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment forDome, and we have no intention of selling it."    Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question thathe was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward thesale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.    He also declined to specify at what price the company wouldconsider selling it shares.    "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (ofDome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.    "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a timewhen the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. Aprice of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairlyattractive," Annesley said.    Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its DomeMines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be anopportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would bevirtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said.    Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 onthe Toronto Stock Exchange.    Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructuredebt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56major creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.
