The Chicago Mercantile Exchange'sboard of the directors has decided to drop a proposal to placea limit on daily price movements of its Standard and Poor's 500futures contract, CME President William Brodsky said.    Brodsky told the Futures Industry Association that theexchange's board decided Tuesday to withdraw the proposal,which aimed to quell price volatility in the popular contract.    He said the proposal to establish a one-year pilot programhad generated much negative reaction among users of thecontract and that the CFTC "was not comfortable" with the plan.    "Now, given the CFTC's posture on our filing, we feel thenegatives outweigh the positives," Brodsky said.    Brodsky said market users were concerned that limits could"become self-fulfilling because they could force sales to(allow users to) avoid becoming locked into the market."    He also said the board was concerned that the one-yearpilot price limit might become permanent. "Rules when put inplace sometimes don't come off," he said. Reuter&#3;
