A prolonged dry spell has damaged111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provincesin the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officialssaid.    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produceestimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack ofrainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailingconditions continued until next month.    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped thelosses would be offset by the expected increase in output inother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dryspell.    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has beenhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national totalthus the damage is considered negligible.    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled byproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversifiedinto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut productionin the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were noreports of actual damage.
