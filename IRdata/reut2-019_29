Indonesia has increased its share in a434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhudsaid.    The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raisedits share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yenin government loans to the company for an equity stake.    The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas EconomicCooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.    Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yendebt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciationof the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold indollars.    Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago toabout 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even ifprices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.    Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes ayear, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan. REUTER&#3;
