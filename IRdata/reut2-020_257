The European Community's farmers'pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a taxon vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats taxwhich has already been proposed by the EC Commission.    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference onTuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanismfor cereal substitutes.    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with theDanish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chairmeetings of their EC colleagues.    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would helpthe EC's budget problems and would provide some price stabilityfor producers.    This would in turn help the market position for certaincrops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peasand beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severeoutput restrictions.    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats taxon imported and domestically produced oils and marine fatssucceeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual ECprice fixing.    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains itsproposals for a tax.    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursueinternational negotiations on farm trade with the aim ofbridging the gap between EC and world prices. Reuter&#3;
