Delegates from the National PorkProducers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs forcontrol and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of anational safe drug use program.    The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress inIndianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradicationprogram at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC'sPRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.    The PRV committee received results of a three year, fivestate pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate ineradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The projectwas jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.    "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states todeal with their own problems according to a timetable thatsuits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRVoversight committee said.    In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a planasking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe druguse program.    The program would establish better relationships betweenproducers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a qualityassurance program in pork production, according to the plan.    "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we areconcerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugssafely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue ineffect," Wehler said.
