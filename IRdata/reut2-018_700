The Securities and ExchangeCommission began proceedings in which it will consider allowingoptions trading on exchange-listed securities on more than oneoptions market.    In a three-nil decision, the SEC voted to seek publiccomment on a proposed rule removing restrictions that preventthe options from being traded on more than one market.    Exclusive trading rights in options on exchange-listedstocks are now determined by a lottery system among optionsexchanges.    The SEC also voted to ask the New York, American, ChicagoBoard Options, Pacific and Philadelphia Exchanges tovoluntarily postpone an options allocation lottery scheduledfor June 22 while the matter is under consideration.    Richard Ketchum, head of the SEC's division of marketregulation, said the exchanges are not required to adhere tothe request. Reuter&#3;
