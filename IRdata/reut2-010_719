Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou haswithdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at anAmerican army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oilrights in the Aegean eased.    A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened totackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea keptto Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potentialclash.    Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefingopposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.    The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request toWashington to close down its telecommunications base at NeaMakri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which hadprompted it to make the request were no longer valid.    Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece hasthe right to ask for suspension of operations at times when itsnational interests are threatened.    The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it wouldsearch for oil round three Greek islands off its coastfollowing an announcement from Greece that it planned to drilleast of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-ledoil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.    Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreementunder which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in theAegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.Athens says it considers the accord inactive.    The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it hadreceived an assurance from Greece that it would not carry outoil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declinedcomment on the statement.    Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take thelong-standing continental shelf dispute to the InternationalCourt of Justice at The Hague.    Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis saidhe had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO GeneralSecretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row. REUTER&#3;
