U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no presentpurpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price.    Asked in an interview if it was time to consider amarketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, "I don't think so. Idon't think the world price is lower than our price anyway."    However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditionsof surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate toconsider a marketing loan.    "I suppose that under that condition there is a danger ourexports will continue to drop and that the government willcontinue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans," he said. "Itmight be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there werea world market that was lower than our market." Reuter&#3;
