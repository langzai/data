Henry Kaufman, managing director ofSalomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist AlanGreenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income andcurrency markets.    "The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. Thefundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward,interrupted by intermittent rallies," Kaufman said in astatement. He said the implication for equity markets inneutral to bullish.    Kaufman said, "Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the officeof the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility bothdomestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have todemonstrate both his competence and policy independence beforehe can gain full confidence of the financial markets."    Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.economy, while his professional skills in the internationalarea are much more limited, Kaufman noted.    "Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his viewson issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initiallycarry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker." Reuter&#3;
