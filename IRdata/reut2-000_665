UAL Inc's United Airlines was accused ina congressional hearing today of locking blacks out of keyjobs, but the company said it had made tremendous progress inminority hiring.    The issue was aired during a hearing of a House GovernmentOperations subcommittee whose chairman, Rep. Cardiss Collins,called the treatment of minorities by the country's largestairline "pathetic."    "It strikes me odd," said the Illinois Democrat, "that thenumber of white women pilots is more than double that of blackpilots, and that white women are more fairly represented inupper management."    United has been under a court order since 1976 to increaseits minority employment.    David Pringle, United's senior vice president for humanresources, said "We take a very aggressive approach to minorityhiring and have made tremendous progress ... we will continueto pursue even wider goals."
