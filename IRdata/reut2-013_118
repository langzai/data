Rising demand for U.S. rice maygradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should helpincrease the U.S. share of the world rice market despitesluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, thedepartment said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mlnhundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt onJuly 31.    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage isexpected to decline this year, the report said.    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grainacreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grainrelative to long grain have increased, the loan differentialhas been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yieldsrelative to those of other classes have leveled off.    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from themarketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at afaster rate, USDA said.    "Development of new products and increased promotion havehelped make rice more available and visible to a wider range ofconsumers," USDA said.    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 becauseof large production and stocks but a weaker market shouldaffect competing exporters more than the U.S.    "The United States has already recovered a substantial shareof the European Community market and made inroads into marketsin the Middle East and Africa," the report said.    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levelsin 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,increased domestic production and low import prices haveallowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarsegrains.    China, India and South Korea have increased output, whilethe Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since themid-1970s, the report said. Reuter&#3;
