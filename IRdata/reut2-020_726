Texaco Inc said removal ofsulphur emissions from the hot coal gases inside Texaco's coalgasifier will be studied under a two-phase, five-year programagreed to with the U.S. Energy Department.    Texaco said the program could total some 17 mln dlrs injoint government/industry funding. The company has agreed tpcontributed a minimum of 20 pct of the cost, it said.    The agreement calls for the DOE to fund the remainder,Texaco said, adding the private sectors share could grow ifother organizations joint the test prgram.       Texaco said the experimental technique involves injecting"sorbents" such as iron oxide or calcium compounds directlyinto the gasification vessel used in its proprietary CoalGasification Process.    Such in situ sulphur capture could reduce or eliminate theneed for separte clean-up devices after syhthetic gas isproduced from coal, the company explained. Reuter&#3;
