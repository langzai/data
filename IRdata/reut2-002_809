Exxon Corp said that forgeries of a20-year zero-coupon Euronote issued by its Exxon Capital Corpsubsidiary have been discovered in the European market.    The issue involved was launched in 1984 and matures onNovember 15, 2004. About 1,900 notes with a total face value of19 mln dlrs and a market value of about four mln dlrs have beenidentified so far, the company said.    Exxon said that Morgan Guaranty Trust Co, the fiscal andpaying agent for the issue, Euro-clear and Cedel (the two majorEuropean securities clearing systems), and police in London andBrussels are investigating the case.    Indications of forgeries came to light on Wednesday atMorgan Guaranty Trust Co in London, which acts as Euro-clear'sdepositary, and Exxon said they were confirmed today.    Euro-clear told Exxon that it has examined to itssatisfaction all the notes at the depositary and is checkingthe authenticity of new deposits of the notes as they enter theEuro-clear System.    Cedel is also reviewing all notes within its system, Exxonadded. At Exxon's direction, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co standsready to validate any notes in order to establish theirauthenticity, Exxon said.    A spokeswoman for Exxon was unable to say whethersecondary-market trading in the notes had been affected or whowould have legal responsibility for reimbursing defraudedinvestors.    Zero-coupon forgeries have turned up in the Euromarketbefore. Because there are no interest coupons attached to thebond certificates, they are easier to forge than coupon issues,market sources said.
