The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securitiesrepurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bankspokesman said.    Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buyback securities pledged on May 6.    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today asan earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectivelywithdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market withtoday's allocation.    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that thewithdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of creditpolicy, but was to be seen in the context of plentifulliquidity in the banking system.    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbankover the first six days of the month, well clear of the likelyApril minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banksthemselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too muchliquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt theeffectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its mainopen-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Twofurther pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside thatrange are possible, dealers said. REUTER&#3;
