Representatives from 26 Latin Americancountries ended a United Nations trade meeting here today witha call for greater economic integration between developing andindustrialised countries.    "(We) urge the international community to recognise the ...difficulties which confront the region," a statement released bythe group, termed the San Jose Communique, said.    The meeting was held under the auspices of the LatinAmerican Economic System, CEPAL, a United Nations affiliate,and aimed to develop a joint regional position ahead of July'sconference in Geneva of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development, UNCTAD.    The communique said Latin America's priority remained theneed for sustained economic growth and for easier terms on its400 billion dlrs external debt.    Within that framework the region would be pressing inGeneva for more access to industrialised markets for itsexports and for compensatory capital inflows when world pricesfor its mainly agricultural exports were low, it said.    The communique also said the group would press for thegeneralised system of preferences -- easy entry terms fordeveloping country exports -- to be expanded.    UNCTAD was set up in 1964 to promote better internationaltrading conditions for developing countries and help raisetheir standard of living. Reuter&#3;
