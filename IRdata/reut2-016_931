Japan is faced with a mounting crisisover its huge trade surplus and recognizes that it must actmore quickly to refocus its export driven economy, a seniorForeign Ministry official said.    "The sense of crisis among the Japanese public as well asthe government is increasing," Deputy Director General HiroshiHirabayashi told reporters. "The need to accelerate the efforts(to restructure the economy) is well recognized."    Hirabayashi said that gradual progress had been made torefocus the Japanese economy, but admitted that it might notseem all that spectacular to foreign observers.    Difficulties had been encountered in implementing theso-called Maekawa report since it was unveiled a year ago, hesaid. But, he added, foreign governments should appreciate theefforts that have been made.    The report, named for its principal author, former Bank ofJapan governor Haruo Maekawa, called for a shift in Japan'seconomy away from its dependence on exports for growth. TheJapanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since itsrelease.    According to Hirabayashi, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasonetold his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the directionset out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieveit.    Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough hadbeen done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocusits economy.    Listing some of those actions, Hirabayashi said imports ofmanufactured goods have increased, interest rates have fallen,and coal, steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced.    He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in thefuture to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion thatit would take ten years for Maekawa's goals to be met.    "It will not take very much time to fulfill the (goals) setout by the Maekawa report," he said. REUTER&#3;
