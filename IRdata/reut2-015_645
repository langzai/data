Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Cal, saidhe introduced legislation to triple the federal excise taxes onbeer and on two types of wine which have the least alcohol.    His bill would raise the tax on beer from nine dlrs to 27dlrs per 31-gallon barrel, an increase of about 32 cents persix pack. The tax on the two types of wine would go from 17cents to 51 cents per gallon and from 67 cents to 2.01 dlrs pergallon respectively, he said in a statement.    "Raising the tax rates on beer and wine is an entirelyjustifiable means of reducing the deficit. It would alsomodestly discourage excessive drinking," Beilenson said. Reuter&#3;
