Cominco Ltd has nocontract negotiations scheduled this week with any of the fivestriking locals at the Trail smelter and Kimberley lead-zincmine, union spokesmen said.    However, leaders of the negotiating teams are trying to setup an informal meeting to discuss the stalemate, said JohnOwens, spokesman for United Steelworkers of America local 480,which is one of three locals that represents 2,600 productionand maintenance workers.    Owens also said Cominco has said the strike is costing itfive mln Canadian dlrs a day in debt service costs that are notcovered by revenue. He said the company has not estimated totallost revenue and Cominco spokesmen were not immediatelyavailable for comment.    The strike, which began May nine, also involves two localsthat represent 600 office and technical workers.    The production and maintenance workers three weeks agorejected a tentative three-year agreement that provided cost ofliving adjustments but no basic wage increase.    Each of the five locals has a separate contract thatexpired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and110,000 long tons of lead last year.
