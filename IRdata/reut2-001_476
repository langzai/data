A one billion stg issue of nine pctExchequer stock due 2002 which became available for tradingonly this morning was exhausted in mid-afternoon trading on theU.K. Government bond market, dealers said.    The Bank of England said the issue was no longer operatingas a tap. The issue was announced Monday at a price of 96 stgpct and dealers said the Government broker's supplies were soldout this afternoon at a partly-paid 20-20/32 stg pct. The bondsstarted trading this morning at 20 stg pct.    Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demandthroughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength.    Dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap fromboth domestic and overseas sources, including from Japan andthe U.S.    Although the issue had not been designated as free of taxto residents abroad (FOTRA) widespread bullish sentiment forthe market in general had generated foreign buying.    The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when itwas announced and dealers said that even first thing thismorning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparableexisting stocks.    However, sterling's continuing firm performance hadprompted interest in the tap right at the outset.    The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paidstructure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment ofthe major part of the price until April 27, but also conferreda substantial gearing element.    This meant, dealers explained, that investors who boughtthe bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by themarket in general, although only 20 stg pct of the totalpurchase price was tied up initially.
