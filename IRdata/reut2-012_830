American Motors Corp said itwill ask Jeep dealers to inspect about 20,000 Cherokee,Wagoneer and Comanche vehicles equipped with 4.0-liter,6-cylinder engines to determine whether the air control valvefor the fuel injection system is out of design tolerance.    The company said it will seek about 5,000 affectedvehicles, all 1987 models, manufactured between Jan 15 andMarch 3, 1987.
