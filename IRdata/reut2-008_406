Martin T. Sosnoff said his &lt;MTSAcquisition Corp> to date has received only a "negligible"number of Caesars World Inc shares in response to its 28-dlr-per-share tender offer for all shares.    Sosnoff also said he has held preliminary talks with PrattHotel Corp &lt;PRAT> and Southmark Corp &lt;SM> on forming a jointventure to enter into talks to acquire Caesars in a friendlytransaction in which Sosnoff would have a 50 pct interest andPratt and Southmark the remainder.    Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are notbeing actively pursued at the presentand may or may not becontinued in the future.  He said there could be no assurancethat a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars wouldagreed to talks.  "Several preliminary contacts withrepresentatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indicationthat it wishes to enter into such negotiations," Sosnoff said.    He said based on talks with staff members of gamingauthorities, there can be no assurance that the necessaryregulatory review of its bid for Caesars World can be completedby the original April Three expiration date.    Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15.  Thebid remains subject to regulatory approvals and the arrangementof financing.    Pratt, which owns the Sands Hotel and Casino in AtlanticCity, N.J., where Caesars operates the Boardwalk Regency Hoteland Casino, recently waged an apparently unsuccessful campaignto acquire control of Resorts International Inc &lt;RTA> againstNew York developer Donald Trump.  Southmark owns about 37 pctof Pratt Hotel.    Caesars World's boasrd has urged rejection of the offer onthe grounds that it is inadequate and has said it wouldinvestigate alternative transactions.  Sosnoff currently ownsabout 13.3 pct of Caesars World. Reuter&#3;
