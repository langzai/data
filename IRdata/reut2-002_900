The value of China's industrial output inJanuary and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in thesame 1986 period, the New China News Agency said.    Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.    The agency said the most recent increase was largely due tolast year's poor performance. "No significant improvement wasmade in economic results," it said, adding that some successeswere reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in thelast quarter of 1986.    The agency said the amount of tied up working capital roseand sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.    It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987industrial production to increase at a proper rate and withbetter results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underwaythroughout the country.
