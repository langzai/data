The European Parliament threatened toblock European Community spending plans for next year andimplied it could also hold up attempts to solve anever-deepening budget crisis this year.    The Parliament voted unanimously in favour of a resolutioncondemning the annual haggling and compromising between theCommunity's 12 member states on spending levels.    "It is no longer possible to resort to short-term measuresor to provisional budgetary solutions. It is no longer possibleto accept a budget in which real expenditure is not covered byrevenue," the resolution said.    Parliamentary blocking could jeopardise efforts to solve afinancing crisis over a five billion European Currency Unit(ECU) shortfall for this year, diplomats said. EC ministers aredeadlocked on the issue.    It also would plunge the EC into an ever-deepening crisisnext year. Without parliamentary approval of the 1988 budget,the Community would be forced into emergency measures, withspending set according to the previous year's levels.    British conservative parliamentarian Peter Price toldreporters that parliament could delay an emergency packageuntil EC ministers prove they are ready to find a long-termsolution. Reuter&#3;
