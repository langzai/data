Turkey pulled warships back from closeescort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflictwith Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated.    The semi-official Anatolian Agency said naval vessels endedtheir close protection of the ship as it continued work inTurkish waters but were following it at a distance.    Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkishresolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull backfrom planned exploration in disputed international waters.    "Intense United States and NATO efforts bore fruit: Greecewill stay in its national waters," said the daily Gunes. Thetop-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: "Our resolutestand made Greece see reason."    But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted inidentical headlines -- "Crisis Frozen" -- that the basicdisagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved.    The confrontation eased after the Turkish government saidit had been assured Athens would not begin prospecting indisputed waters. REUTER&#3;
