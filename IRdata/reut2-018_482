Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> and Sharp Corp&lt;SHRP.T> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personalcomputers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels,despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmentold Reuters.    They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at avertingEC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeansfeared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets afterWashington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.    Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of thepersonal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.    Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computerswould continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.    Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-toppersonal computers would continue at last year's level of12,000 to 16,000 units a year.    Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's allegedfailure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade. REUTER&#3;
