Treasury Assistant Secretary DavidMulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrialnations is intended to produce "reasonable stability" in exchangemarkets over the next few months.    He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Fivenations and Canada agreed in Paris to "see if there can't be aperiod of reasonable stability instead of volatility" to givetime for the committments in Paris to take place.    Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. interventionwas not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied thatthe administration judged that after economic adjustments,current exchange rates reflect underlying economicfundamentals.    In particular, the stability sought by the nations wouldallow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economiesdomestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulfordsaid in his testimony.    He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar wouldhurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.    Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy wasaffected by international developments.    He also said increased Japanese domestic growth wouldresult in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarilylead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Grammasserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.    Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, "I thinkexchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's andJapan's) efforts can be carried out.    Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domesticgrowth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lowerdollar.    Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a patternof higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. tradedeficit.    Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolvedeither through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, bothalternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable. Reuter&#3;
