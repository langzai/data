Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightlylower growth, higher unemployment and an increased tradedeficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) said.    But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast aslightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Lastyear Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growingeconomies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.    The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.    The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around fivepct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround inimport prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labourcosts and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the reportsaid.    This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demandshould be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumptionmade possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.    Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration inItalian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports andadversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result ina sharp negative contribution to the currrent account. REUTER&#3;
