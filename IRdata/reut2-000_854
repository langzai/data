Comalco Ltd &lt;CMAC.S> said its returnto profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminiumprices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for theyear ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 wasalso aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt andgreater sales of bauxite and aluminium.    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents pershare final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage ofproposed dividend imputation laws.    This would make five cents for the year against a first andfinal of one cent in 1985.    Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to sufferfrom low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australiandollar had helped earnings.    Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> jointventure had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New ZealandAluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;SumitomoAluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increasesin liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said.    As previously reported Comalco's &lt;Commonwealth AluminiumCorp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter atGoldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregonto &lt;Columbia Aluminium Corp>.    Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinaryprovision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that ifthe sales agreement were completed it would reduce theprovision made in the 1986 accounts.    The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchangelosses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision. REUTER&#3;
