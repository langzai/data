Japan's economy remains sluggish but isbeginning to show signs it may bottom out soon, the EconomicPlanning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinetministers.    But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on theyen's exchange rate trend in the immediate future, Agencyofficials said.    The officials told reporters industrial production, down0.5 pct in January from December, is likely to turn positive inFebruary and to rise thereafter, raising hopes for a brightereconomic outlook.    The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2.5pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 0.7 pctin the previous quarter.    A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourthquarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct, theofficials said.    They also said an expected upturn in exports would be amixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth butwould increase the chance of trade friction.    Japanese exports contracted five pct in February fromJanuary but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizesaround current levels, the officials said.    They predicted exports will increase by 2.3 pct in theJanuary/March quarter from the October/December quarter.    "But the problem is imports are not expanding," said oneofficial. Imports fell by 9.4 pct in February from January. REUTER&#3;
