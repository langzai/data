The Nuclear RegulatoryCommission said its staff has ordered Philadelphia Electric Coto shut down the Peach Bottom Nuclear Power Plant at Delta, Pa.    The NRC noted that one Peach Bottom unit is shut down forrefuling and said the other must be brought to cold shutdownwithin 36 hours. Neither unit may be restarted without thecommission's approval, the regulatory body said.    The NRC said it received information on March 24 thatcontrol room operators at Peach Bottom had been observedsleeping while on duty in the control room.    It said the information indicated this conduct waspervasive and has been occurring for some time, and that shiftsupervision had knowledge of this situation.    In response to this information, the regulators said, theyinitiated 24-hour inspection coverage of the plant's controlroom, which is ongoing.    To date, the NRC said, its inspection has establishedoperations control room staff has at times during variousshifts, particularly the 2300 to 0700 shift, slept or otherwisebeen inattentive to duties over the past five months.    The commission said it also found management either knewand condoned the sleeping and inattention, or should have knownabout it, and either took no action or inadequate action tocorrect this situation.
