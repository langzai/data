The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates.    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977.    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990.    "However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction," Lichtblau said.    He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration.    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.    "An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.    Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.    A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.
