World oil prices would remain stabledespite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms andgrowing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister ArturoHernandez Grisanti said on Monday.    He described the situation as "extremely tense," but saidGulf military activity would not significantly affect pricesbecause supply and demand were roughly equal.    Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were nowpumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.    Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance wasprecarious and prices were in danger of falling from theircurrent average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproductioncontinued.    Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation ofPetroleum Exporting Countries were "overproducing in anexaggerated manner" above their assigned quotas, he said.    OPEC's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd. REUTER&#3;
