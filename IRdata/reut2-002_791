The National Pork Producers Council,NPPC, announced at this year's American Pork Congress, APC,that the Congress and trade show will be divided into two partsin 1988.    Next years APC, held in Atlanta, will be a business sessiononly and will continue to be the first week of March.    The trade show is being changed into a new internationalevent called the World Pork Expo. The first expo will be heldin June 1988 in Des Moines with an expanded format, they said.    Executive vice-president Orville Sweet said the decision tospilt the show and Congress came about because there areproducers who never get to see the trade show floor.    "It makes sense that we divide the business session fromthe trade show," Sweet said. Reuter&#3;
