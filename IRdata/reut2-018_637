Dutch consumers and food processorswould be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dickde Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fatsand oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.    The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine andfourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.    The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers andsteeply increase the costs of industries such as potatoprocessing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.    "A move by these industries to countries outside the ECcannot be ruled out," he added.    De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fatswould be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugelyexpensive administratively.    He also said the proposed tax contravened not only articlethree of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theLome Convention, and the United Nations Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty.    The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but alsohave consequences for employment and investment, he added. Reuter&#3;
