The federal Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) proposed new rules that would requireaccounting firms that audit public companies to submit to aperiodic outside review of their operations.    The SEC voted unanimously to seek public comment on theplan, under which an accounting firm would have to hire anotherfirm to conduct a so-called "peer review" every three years orlose the right to audit public companies.    SEC officials conceded peer review would not end allaudit failures but said they hoped it would eliminate audits byclearly unqualified firms and individuals.    "Peer review will not stop all bad audits; we recognizethat," SEC Chief Accountant Clarence Sampson told the five SECcommissioners.    "But we hope the rule will go far to eliminate auditsperformed by individuals without the necessary skills toconduct a proper audit," Sampson said.    The move is largely symbolic, since firms and individualsresponsible for auditing 84 pct of all public companies alreadyvoluntarily undergo peer review every three years, under anaccounting industry self-regulatory plan.    But the SEC has been under pressure for years from somefederal lawmakers to make the accounting industry more open andaccountable to the public.    Agency officials estimated that a peer review would costthe average accounting firm between 1,500 and 2,500 dlrs, or500 to 750 dlrs a year.    "I don't think that (cost) is a dispositive issue," SECChairman John Shad said. "It's within a reasonable range ofcost."    The proposal would exempt foreign auditors of non-U.S.companies required to file financial reports with the SEC. Reuter&#3;
