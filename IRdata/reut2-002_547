South Africa's director-general offinance Chris Stals said he was optimistic about reaching amutually acceptable agreement with foreign bank creditors indebt renegotiation talks scheduled to begin next month.    Stals, the country's chief foreign debt negotiator, said "weare busy finding out how they (banks) feel. They all havedifferent opinions. There is no consensus."    But asked if he was optimistic on agreement for a new debtrepayment plan, Stals replied "yes" in a telephone interview fromhis Pretoria office.    He declined to comment further before the major review ofthe interim debt agreement regarding the moratorium onprincipal repayments on 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's 24billion dlr external debt.    The agreement on the moratorium with some 330 creditorbanks expires on June 30. "We have had a series of discussionswith a great number of banks both bilaterally and individuallyon the foreign debt situation in preparation for April," Stalssaid.    He said no date has been set for the meeting and declinedto comment on published reports in the past few months thatbanks may demand accelerated repayments.    Banking sources here said only an escalation of SouthAfrican political unrest would increase foreign pressure onrepayments.    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said last month that inthe forthcoming talks South Africa would give a fair deal toall creditors but not agree to "unrealistic demands." REUTER&#3;
