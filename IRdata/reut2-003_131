The U.S. Department of Agriculture willprobably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orangecrop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes,analysts and industry sources said.    The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today.    Analysts said the market is anticipating a downwardrevision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted.    The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged sinceOctober, should be affected this time by recent evidence of ashortfall in the early and midseason crop now that thoseharvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDAprojections, the harvests should have been five to seven mlnboxes larger than they were.    "They are going to cut their estimate," said Bob Tate, anFCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. "The onlyquestion is whether they will admit the whole thing in thisestimate."    Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimateby a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue todrop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop pictureclarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly ofValencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted.    "They'll temper it," said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst withShearson Lehman Bros. "The main drop will probably come inJuly."    She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes. Reuter&#3;
