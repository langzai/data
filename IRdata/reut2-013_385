Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita saidhe would support the issuance of Reagan bonds, yen-denominatedU.S. Government securities, if it was considered appropriate, aJapanese daily paper reported.    The Sankei Shimbun quoted Sumita as saying in an interview"It (Reagan bond) is a very feasible idea," speaking in thecontext of the effectiveness of such bonds in halting thedollar's decline.    Asked how he would respond to the idea if it were broughtup at any Group of Five meeting in Washington later this week,the paper quoted him as saying "I will back it up."    But Sumita said the market still has confidence in thedollar, and one must be careful in associating the currentdollar decline with anything like a free fall, the paper said.    In 1978, the administration of then president Jimmy Carterfloated government securities worth four billion dlrs in marksand Swiss francs to try to halt the the dollar's depreciation.    A Bank of Japan spokesman confirmed that the newspaperreport was basically correct.    But a senior central bank official told Reuters that as faras he knew, the idea was not being seriously considered now,either in the U.S. Or in Japan. REUTER&#3;
