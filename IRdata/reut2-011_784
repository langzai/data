International Coffee Organization, ICO,producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a generaldiscussion of the market situation, producer spokesmanLindenberg Sette said.    The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested themeeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executiveboard's regular session this week has so far been confined toroutine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers torevive export quota negotiations, delegates said.    Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month whenproducers and consumers failed to resolve differences on howquotas should be allocated.    Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency amongproducers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with mostcountries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual Septembercouncil session to restart negotiations.    Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called fortoday's producer meeting to exchange views on the marketsituation, the producer delegates said.    The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this weekwas cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee pricesin London and New York futures, traders said.    Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said.    The executive board session looks set to end today,following a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when aconsultancy report of the operation of the ICO will bepresented to producers and consumers, delegates added.
