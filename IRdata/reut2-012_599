The Nigerian naira firmed  against thedollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreignexchange auctions at the central bank were changed.    The marginal rate set at today's auction, from whichreporters were barred for the first time since the sessionsbegan last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said.    Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operationfor the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreignexchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at therate of the lowest successful bid.    The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from biddinghigh and thus driving down the naira's value. But bankingsources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchangeremained sharply higher than the available funds.    Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight,instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offercompared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week.    The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact onbids. Today's highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared witha top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago.    Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able topass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal ratewill only act as a marker for transactions. REUTER&#3;
