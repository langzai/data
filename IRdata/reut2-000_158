Brazil's 14-bank advisory committeeexpressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator AntonioPadua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interestpayments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibankto creditor banks worldwide.    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep angerand frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral movelast Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrsof short-term trade and interbank lines.    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreigndebt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibankexecutive William Rhodes and representatives from committeevice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,told the banks that the government was preparing a telex toexplain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,bankers said.    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plansfor Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercialbankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker and International Monetary Fund managing directorMichel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.    Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoonwhat impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with aninitial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary MarioBrodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs innew loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. Argentinahas threatened to emulate Brazil's payments moratorium if thebanks do not grant its request. Reuter&#3;
