Grain handling at Rotterdam port'smain grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of thelargest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike forthe third day running.    Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan ElevatorMij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through theport, said their main Europoort terminal was out of actionbecause of a strike by technical staff.    The actions, in support of union demands in negotiationsover a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grainhandlers stopped work.    Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today'sscale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdamwould face delays, but this was not happening yet.    Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pctoperational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday.    Talks between unions and employers yesterday and todayproduced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the unionwas prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour workingweek, at the bottom of the agenda.    Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a rangeof issues were far in excess of the management's final offer. REUTER&#3;
