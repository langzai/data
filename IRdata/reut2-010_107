Royal Bank of Canada Chairman AllanTaylor said Ottawa and the provinces risk weakening thecountry's financial system if they do not agree on a harmonizedregulatory regime for financial institutions.    Taylor also said it was vital that the federal government retain its existing powers under Ottawa's major new proposalsto revamp the country's financial system.    "Unless great care is taken now, in the detailed draftingand implementation of regulatory change, we could actually endup weakening our financial system," Taylor told a businessluncheon.    "Also, we must avoid costly and inefficient duplication ofregulation and supervision between federal and provincialauthorities," Taylor continued.    Earlier this week Federal Minister of State for Finance,Tom Hockin, said progress was being made with his provincialcounterparts on the proposals that involve removing thetraditional barriers separating the banking, securities and insurance sectors.    The governments are attempting to resolve a jurisdictionaldispute over who regulates what under the new system. Theprovinces have traditionally had authority in the securitiesfield while Ottawa oversaw the banking sector.    But the Chairman of Canada's largest bank stressed that Ottawa should retain its regulatory powers to "preserve anefficient, competitive, national financial system."    On the free trade talks under way with the U.S., Taylorsaid Canadian negotiators must insure banks have as much accessto the American market as U.S. institutions are granted here.    He told a new conference later he was "reasonablyconfident" the Canadian side was making reciprocity infinancial services an issue at the negotiating table. Reuter&#3;
