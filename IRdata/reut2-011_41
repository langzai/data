TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp, whichhas been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection sinceJanuary 1983, said it filed an amended and restated negotiatedplan of reorganization.    A hearing on the adequacy of the disclosure statement isscheduled for April 29 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for theSouthern District of Texas.    Basic terms of the amended and restated negotiated planhave not changed from the original plan filed last October, thecompany said.     The amended filing reflects adding ancillary documents tothe plan filed in October, it said.    Assuming the plan is found adequate on April 29,TransAmerican would then seek acceptance from creditors whichis relatively assured since they participated in thenegotiations, the company said.    Liabilities in excess of one billion dlrs are beingreorganized under the amended plan which provides for fulldebt-repayment to secured bank lenders.    Unsecured creditors would receive either 100 pct repayment,secured by liens on assets, or one-time lump sum payments of 25to 35 cts on the dollar, in cash, shortly after confirmation ofthe plan by the court.    TransAmerican is vigorously resisting efforts by CoastalCorp &lt;CGP> to acquire its assets through a subsequent plan ofliquidation.    The spokesman said the company is confident its plan willbe confirmed and is optimistic that it will emerge from Chapter11 as early ninety days after the April 29 confirmation.    A Coastal spokesman said it will file a plan in April withthe court and will request the court to review its plan.    On March 17, the company said that as a creditor, which isowed 625,000 dlrs, it has a right to file its own plan whichwill better serve the other creditors in a shorter time.    A TransAmerican spokesman said the net worth of Coastal'soffer is less than 25 pct of the fair market value ofTransamerican's assets which are in excess of one billion dlrs.      Reuter&#3;
