Trading on the London potato futuresmarket will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of theLondon Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statementto floor members.    It was in response to strong representations by the PotatoMarketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion ofprice which they say will result in large deliveries into thephysical market when the April futures position expires.    The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futurestrading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore therelationship between futures and physicals.    Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and corneringof the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigationsby the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), theInternational Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and otherparties, found no evidence to substantiate this.    The main complaint from some sections of the physicalmarket is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium overthe PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded thismorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB'saverage price of 104 stg.    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there isa two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said qualitypotatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been payingbetween 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesserquality grades have traded below 100 stg.    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be deliveredagainst the April futures contract between now and the end ofthe month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the managementcommittee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpracticeand he assured the committee is monitoring the situation. Reuter&#3;
