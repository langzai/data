The U.S. Department of Transportationsaid it gave final approval to USAir Group's proposed 400 mlndlr acquisition of Pacific Southwest Airlines.    The department said the acquisition is not likely tosubstantially lessen competition and would not harm the publicinterest.    The department had given its tentative approval of theacquisition in January.    The department said it decided to make final its tentativedecision after reviewing the public response to it.    The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air NorthAmerica, which currently is not operating but plans to startservice to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that theacquisition would lessen chances of new entry into thosemarkets by other carriers.    The agency said Air North America provided no support forits claim that the transaction would give the two carriersmonopoly power in some markets.    The transportation agency said Air North America alsofailed to show that there are barriers that would prevent newentrants into those markets or prevent other carriers fromincreasing their service.    The agency noted in its final order that PSA operatesexclusively in the West and Mexico while USAir serves the Westfor the most part with some long-haul flights from the East andMidwest.    The two carriers serve five point in common; Los Angeles,San Diego, San Francico, Phoenix and Tucsonm, the agency said.     The transportation department also rejected a request bythe Teamsters Union, which represents some PSA workers, torequire protections for PSA workers.    The agency noted that USAir has promised to give protectivebenefits to PSA workers and that unions representing PSAworkers have collective bargaining agreements that provide suchprotections.
