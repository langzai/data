Caterpillar Inc said it expects 1987full year sales and profits to be "substantially better" than1986 results, following improved third-quarter performance.    Third-quarter earnings of the heavy machinery manufacturerincreased to 146 mln dlrs, or 1.47 dlrs a share, from net lossof 26 mln dlrs, or 26 cts, in the 1986 quarter. Sales rose to2.25 billion dlrs from 1.82 billion dlrs last year.    A weaker U.S. dollar strengthened Caterpillar's positionagainst foreign manufacturers and permitted price increases andboosted sales, while a cost-cutting program lowered costssignificantly, the company said of third-quarter results.       Continuation of the cost-reduction program, which is topare costs by 15 to 20 pct from 1986 to 1990, and a furtheranticipated improvement in its price competitiveness areexpected to contribute to higher full year 1987 profits,Caterpillar said.    In 1986, the company earned 76 mln dlrs or 77 cents ashare. Reuter&#3;
