Rising service payments on Kenya's threebillion dlr external debt will absorb nearly all the 1.1billion dlrs of foreign aid likely over the next four years,President Daniel arap Moi said.    "While we expect to receive 18.3 billion Kenyan shillings inthe form of external loans for our development programs in thenext four years, we will be repaying more than 13.5 billion...By way of external debt servicing...," Moi told a conference ofAmerican businessmen in Nairobi.    The president added that if developing countries continueto experience foreign exchange outflows on this scale, manywill be unable to sustain a level of imports necessary toensure economic growth. He called on the internationalcommunity to ensure a real transfer of resources from theindustrialised to the developing countries.    Moi said Kenya had so far met all obligations regarding itsforeign debt, which his government has never tried toreschedule. REUTER&#3;
