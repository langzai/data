Eastman Kodak Co said it willreduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiberoperations of its Eastman Chemicals division.    A company spokesman said the company will take "somewriteoff" in connection with the action in the first quarterand there will probably be a further "carryover" writeoff inthe second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs ofplants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connectedwith the staff cuts.    Kodak said the division will discontinue production ofpolyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at itsCarolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,mostly in Columbia.    The company said about 350 jobs will be affected inColumbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant inKingsport, Tenn.    Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achievedthrough an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement planfor employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical ProductsInc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten DefenseCorp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to becompleted by April 30.    Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performancehave led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POYproduction will be shut down as a result of its exit from thebusiness. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastmansince last year.    The company said annual capacity for production of Kodelpolyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from500 mln due to lesser demand.    It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phasein a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.    Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsportunits affected about 10,800.    The company spokesman later said the charges will beinsignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.
