France's growth rate is expected tostrengthen in the second half of this year after a poor firsthalf, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECDforecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said therate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantlyhigher than in the first half of this year.    The OECD said France's economic situation has deterioratedsomewhat during the early months of 1987.     Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventoryadjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflationhas reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely toreach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demandpick up in the second half of this year. But both data arelikely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices forthe second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first sixmonths. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pctfor the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct. REUTER&#3;
