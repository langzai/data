U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigesaid U.S. Sales of high technology to China are rising despitePeking's complaints they are being restricted.    He told reporters at the airport on arriving here for talksthat technology transfers to China had increased every year andwould continue to do so.    The official Peking Review yesterday accused the UnitedStates of delaying approval on high-technology sales to China.    Last year, Washington approved only 60 pct of the exportsChina applied for, the magazine said.    "The COCOM-listed kind of export controls are just afraction of the technology that the U.S. Is transferring (toChina) by other means, such as joint ventures," Baldrige said.    COCOM is the Western coordinating committee formed afterWorld War Two to limit the export of advanced technology toCommunist nations.    Baldrige said he was sure U.S. Firms could compete againstfirms from other countries for high technology sales.    He added that protectionism would hurt the economies oftrading nations and said the Reagan Administration would fightprotectionist legislation in the U.S. Congress.    Baldrige and China's Foreign Trade Minister Zheng Tuobinwill act as chairmen of the fifth session of a commission oncommerce and trade that will review bilateral trade relations.    A U.S. Official said other issues to be raised duringBaldrige's talks are trade deficits, which each country says ithas with the other, and the problems facing U.S. Companiesinvesting in China.
