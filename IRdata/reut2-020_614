Former Treasury Secretary William Simonsharply criticised President Reagan for irresponsible fiscalpolicies that contributed to this week's stock price collapse.    "(Reagan) fell for that siren song that you can cut taxeswithout cutting spending and that we would 'grow our way out ofthis,' and everything would be wonderful," Simon said, in anapparent reference to the massive U.S. budget deficit.    "Every time we hear that nonsense we ought to howl withpain as we were howling yesterday and are howling today," hesaid in an interview taped this afternoon for the MacNeilLehrer Newshour which will air at 1930 EDT (2330 GMT).    Simon, who held his post under presidents Nixon and Ford,said Reagan's tax cuts are positive for saving and investment.    And he blamed Congress for causing the U.S.'s fiscalproblems by putting self-interest ahead of national interest.    "It's not only the president. It's Congress ... underRepublicans and Democrats alike," he said. "They're a bunch ofhypocrites who have one credo -- that credo is 'more.'" Reuter&#3;
