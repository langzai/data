Ford Motor Co said it is developing analuminum space frame for its Probe V concept car using extrudedstretch-formed aluminum that could lead to new techniques forbuilding production cars in the future.    It said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and costwhile maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness. Theframe has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, Fordsaid.  The company said the lighter weight would allow smallerpowertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight andimproving fuel economy.    Ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000dlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars forsteel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number ofwelds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.
