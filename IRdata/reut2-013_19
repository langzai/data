The United Food And CommercialWorkers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of theunion will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquartersprotesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover ofSupermarkets General &lt;SGL>.    Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain ofsupermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area andalso owns Rickels home centers.    The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bidbecause "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in thecurrent takeover mania."    A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow ourmembers to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executivesand the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions."    Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, whichlast year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.The Hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs inprofits, analysts estimate.    The union said that Dart's Safeway bid forced a majorrestructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers andcaused a loss of thousands of jobs. Reuter&#3;
