A U.S. Bankruptcy Judge ruled that&lt;TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp> can not seek an injunction inTexas State court to block Coastal Corp &lt;CGP> from presenting aplan of reorganization in TransAmerican's bankruptcyproceeding.    However, U.S. bankruptcy judge Manuel Leal also ruled thatTransAmerican could pursue its two billion dlr lawsuit againstCoastal that alleges the Houston based gas company isattempting to unlawfully gain control of Transamerican's Texasgas reserve and pipeline system.    Leal told both Coastal and TransAmerican that he plans tomaintain jurisdiction over TransAmerican's bankruptcyreorganization proceedings that began in 1983.    After the hearing, John Nabors, a lawyer for TransAmerican,said the company would pursue its state court lawsuit seeking2.0 billion dlrs in damages from Coastal.    Nabors contends that Coastal has unlawfully attempted toreplace TransAmerican's negotiated reorganization plan payingsecured creditors in full with a plan of its own.    "They're not going to pay any money under their plan,they're just going to operate (the gas wells) and give profitto the creditors," Nabors said.    He said Coastal's plan, which has not yet been submitted tothe Bankruptcy Court, offered to pay creditors 50 mln dlrsannually for seven years.    TransAmerican's plan would repay a total of 770 mln dlrs indebts to secured creditors and the equivalent of 30 cts on thedollar to unsecured creditors.     A Coastal unit is among Transamerican's unsecuredcreditors and is owed about 600,000 dlrs.    Transamerican said it is the second largest producer ofnatural gas in Texas with reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feetand more than 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.    Coastal, one of the nation's largest gas producers, earned71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion dlrs in 1986. Reuter&#3;
