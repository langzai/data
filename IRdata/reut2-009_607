France's right-wing government nowexpects to raise about 40 billion francs this year from itsprivatisation program, 10 billion more than it targetted, PrimeMinister Jacques Chirac said.    The success of the program, launched late last year, meantthe government would be able to go beyond the 30 billion francfigure it estimated in its 1987 budget, he said in a televisioninterview.    About 75 pct of the additional revenue would be used to cutstate debt and 25 pct to provide additional funds for publicsector investment, he said.    Chirac said Finance Minister Edouard Balladur proposed tomake two billion francs of supplementary funding available fora five biillion franc accelerated motorway building program.    The remaining three billion francs for this would come froma motorway loan now in the domestic market.    Balladur also proposed to make some extra cash available tothe French national railways, SNCF, for the construction ofhigh-speed rail track, and to boost research in the aerospaceindustry, he added.    An estimated 15,000 jobs would be generated by speeding upmotorway construction, Chirac said.    Reaffirming his long term strategy of cutting the statesector deficit and easing taxes, Chirac repeated governmentpledges to cut the corporate tax rate to 42 pct from 45 pct inthe 1988 budget.    Personal income tax would also be reduced but details hadstill to be worked out, he added.    The government aimed to make France the leading economicpower in Western Europe within five years, he told histelevision interviewer. Reuter&#3;
