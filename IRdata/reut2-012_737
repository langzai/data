The Soviet Union conducted an undergroundnuclear test aimed at perfecting military techology, theofficial news agency Tass reported.    Tass said the test was carried out at 0120 gmt at theSemipalatinsk testing ground in Kazakhstan, Soviet CentralAsia.    It was the third Soviet underground blast since Moscowhalted an 18-month nuclear test moratorium last February,saying Washington's refusal to join the ban had forced it toresume testing.    Moscow began its unilateral nuclear test moratorium inAugust 1985, calling on the United States to agree to a totalban on testing as the first step to nuclear disarmament.    Last December it announced that it would end the freezeafter the first U.S. Test this year.    Washington had continued testing, saying the blasts werenecessary to maintain its nuclear deterrent and that problemsremained concerning the monitoring of a test freeze.    The United States staged one test on February 3 and anotheron February 11. Moscow responded with a blast on February 26and a second on March 12.    Soviet officials and the state media blamed the resumptionof testing on the U.S. Decision not to join the freeze. Reuter&#3;
