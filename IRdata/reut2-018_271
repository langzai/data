Sears, Roebuck and Co's stock wasdowngraded one notch from a neutral rating, said E.F. Huttonanalyst Bernard Sosnick.    The company's stock closed at 50, off 1-1/4.    Sosnick said "sluggish sales cloud the economic picture andconcern about the outlook for credit income diminish Sears'near-term investment prospects." He said the retail sales inMay were weak, which would mean sales have been below plan forthe past two months.    Sosnick said indications are that Sears may not be asstrong a performer as other retailers.    However, he said his earnings estimate for the company for1987 remains unchanged at 4.50 dlrs a share compared to 3.62dlrs a share in 1986. He added that "as a result of weakeningsales momentum, we have less confidence in that estimate."    The analyst said it projects second quarter earnings in the1.05 to 1.10 dlrs a share range, up from 77 cts a year ago. The1987 estimate includes an 18 ct a share gain from the sale of50 savings bank branches and strong earnings contribution fromAllstate Insurance. Reuter&#3;
