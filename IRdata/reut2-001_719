The chairman of the U.S. Housesubcommittee on dairy, livestock and poultry issues, Rep.Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.), said it is likely the U.S. dairysupport price will be cut next year.    "It looks like the price cut may take place," Stenholm saidat a hearing today on dairy issues.    Under the 1985 farm bill, the Agriculture Secretary canlower the U.S. milk price support to 10.60 dlrs per cwt fromthe current 11.35 dlrs if government purchases of dairyproducts are forecast to exceed five billion lbs in 1988.    The U.S. Agriculture Department forecasts governmentpurchases of dairy products will total six to seven billion lbsin fiscal 1987, but says the level of purchases beyond 1987will depend on the production decisions of dairy farmers.
