Most economists expect the seasonally-adjusted annualizedrate to ease to about 1.75 mln units in February from justunder 1.81 mln in both January and December.    "The level of housing starts is likely to have declinedmodestly but still have remained at a relatively high level,"said Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc.    Unfortunately, meaningful comparisons between February'sand prior months' underlying trends may prove difficult.    "Caution should be used when interpreting (December's andJanuary's) increase," cautioned Smith Barney's Greenbaum.    "Although underlying fundamentals remain strong -- mortgagerate stability, healthy income gains -- warmer than usualweather undoubtedly also had some influence in pushing startshigher in both months," he added.    Economists at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc were moresuccinct in a weekly newsletter: "a slight decline across theboard, no particular economic reason, mostly weather."    Charles Lieberman of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corpsaid single-family homes would account for most of the housingstarts drop although Smith Barney's Greenbaum saw signs ofstabilization in both the single- and multi-family sectors.
