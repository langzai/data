The continued strength of the Swiss francagainst the dollar will largely deprive Swiss exporters of thebenefits of the upturn in the world economy, a quarterly studyby the Economics Department said.    It said the export industry would scarcely get a boost fromthe upturn in the economies of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), and predicted declines innew orders for highly export-orientated firms.    However, domestic demand, which stagnated in the lastquarter of 1986, would resume its growth, fuelled by higherreal incomes and buoyant consumer sentiment, it said.    The study, which was drawn up by the department'sCommission for Economic Questions, said industrial productionwould scarcely increase, with most firms apparently happy withcurrent numbers of workers.    However, an increase in labour demand in the service sectorshould help push up total employment, it said.    The Commission also predicted an increase in inflation fromcurrent low levels. REUTER&#3;
