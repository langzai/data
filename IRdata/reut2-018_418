OPEC has regained its former role asprice-setter in the oil market following last year's price war,acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said.    But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand forOPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continuedsacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries.    Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, saidthe December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr perbarrel reference price gave the market a signal that theproducers' group was serious.    "It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and thishas restored its credibility," said al-Chalabi, who is inCaracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors.    Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded theproduction quotas which took effect on February 1 and spotmarket prices are now near or above official OPEC prices.    Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basicdilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said."The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price andrisk losing its market share? Or defend its market share andlet the price drop?" he asked.    "OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question ishow long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?" he said.    Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring upprices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw noquick end to restraint in production.    He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oilbecause increased non-OPEC production, combined withconservation and the use of alternative energy sources, hascaused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.
