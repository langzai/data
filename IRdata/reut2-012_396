Chemicals group BayerAG &lt;BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.    The company said that this was despite the mark's furtherstrengthening against the dollar and other currencies anddespite an increase in competitive pressure.    "The further progress of our business will depend largely onthe extent to which threats to free trade materialise and onthe developments of exchange rates, raw material and energycosts.    Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billionmarks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72billion from 1.62 billion.    The company gave no net profit figures or any indication ofthe likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985results, up one mark from a year earlier.    Bayer said that world group operating profit declinedslightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showeda further improvement.    Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainlythe sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.    Lower prices on the raw material side had also broughtpressure on selling prices, it added.    In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against1985, the company said without giving details.    "The western Europe, North America and Far East regionsdeveloped well in local currency, but here too the translationof local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,especially in the case of North America," it said.    Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.    Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combinedwith savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offsetfalling prices and cost increases in other areas.    The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lowerextraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating rawmaterials all developed well, it said.    Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that worldgroup turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last threemonths of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.    Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pctto 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower andforeign turnover 8.6 pct lower.    Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarteragainst 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985. REUTER&#3;
