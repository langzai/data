The House of Representatives voted217 to 206 to raise the national speed limit from 55 to 65miles per hour on rural sections of interstate highways.    The legislation would give state governments the authorityto raise the speed limit on about three-fourths of the 43,000miles interstate system.    The Senate has already approved the speed limit increase aspart of an 88 billion dlr federal highway and mass transitfunding bill. The bill must go back to the Senate for finalaction. Congress set the 55 mile per hour limit in 1974 as anenergy conservation and safety measure. Reuter&#3;
