Global Yield Fund, in a review of itsdividend policy, told shareholders that under the InternalRevenue Code of 1986, the fund must distribute substantiallyall of its net income by the end of each year.    Under the new tax law, the company said annual net incomeincludes net investment income from interest less expenses, pluor minus any ordinary currency gains or losses realized inconnection with the sale of debt securities.       The company said its present dividend policy is to makedistributions of net investment income to stockholdersquarterly and to accumulate any realized ordinary currencygains for distribution as net income at the end of the year.    At present time, the company said such currency gainsamount to about 40 cts per share.
