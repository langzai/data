The Semiconductor IndustryAssociation urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctionsagainst Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor TradeAgreement.    In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the groupsaid sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers asof April 1 and continue until the U.S. is satisfied there isfull compliance with the agreement.    The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductorexports is not what is required.    "America's interests require that agreements be honored andthat U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistentunwillingness or inability of the government of Japan todeliver on its commitments," the trade group said.    The White House Economic Policy Council is expected todiscuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduledfor Thursday.    The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms ofthe agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanesedumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets toforeign-based manufacturers.
