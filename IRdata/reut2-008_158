French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is49.6 pct owned by Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise itscapital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-oneissue of shares and investment certificates to financeexpansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts.    For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mlnfrancs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.    The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans.These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Productsmaize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernessaid.    Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all ofCorn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the Frenchplant, these include three factories in each of Italy and WestGermany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlandsand Denmark.    Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on theinstallations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of theHaubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernessaid.    If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring anddeveloping two other French plants, either in the maize orwheat starch sector.    Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansionfor its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for itscapital increase.    Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division ofBeghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year,has been holding talks with other European companies onpossible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could beintroduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future. REUTER&#3;
