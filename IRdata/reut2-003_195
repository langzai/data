Engineering industryemployers in North Rhine-Westphalia state said they made anunprecedented offer on pay and working hours.    The offer, which came amid warning strikes by some 33,000workers, was the first time since World War Two that employershave proposed cutting working hours and is seen as averting arepeat of the nationwide strike of 1984 which brought the autoindustry to a standstill for seven weeks, union sources said.    The employers propose a half-hour cut in the 38.5 hourworking week from July 1, 1988 and a pay rise of 2.7 pct fromApril 1 and a further 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.    The engineering union IG Metall, Europe's largest union,wants a five pct wage rise and a 35-hour week at full pay.    It called today's warning strikes, mostly involving workstoppages of up to one hour, after more than 50 rounds of talkssince December failed.    The employers' offer was seen breaking the deadlock innegotiations, even though the union said the half-hour cut isnot enough, union sources said.    The offer applies to workers in North Rhine-Westphalia andit was unclear if further offers would be presented in talksbetween unions and employers of other West German states. REUTER&#3;
