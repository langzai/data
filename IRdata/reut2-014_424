Energy Secretary John Herrington toldCongress that a federally chartered corporation would be thebest way to manage and operate the government's uraniumenrichment program.    He said in a letter to Congressmen that unless the program,now run by the Energy Department, is improved, sales worth fivebillion dlrs could be lost between 1990 and 2000.    The program now has annual commercial sales of about onebillion dlrs and holds 50 pct of the free world market forenrichment services.    A department official said the world market for enricheduranium for reactors for power utilities is increasinglycompetitive and private entity could better tap it.    The Administration's plan to spin off the department's uranium enrichment operation is in line with it effort toreduce the federal government's role in areas where it feelsprivate enterprise could be more efficient. reuter&#3;
