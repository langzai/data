Cooper Development Co said itrevised results for the year ended October 31 to a loss of 61.7mln dlrs, or 2.33 dlrs per share, down from thepreviously-reported loss of 12.1 mln dlrs, or 46 cts per share.    The restatement was made because of change in the method ofaccounting for a combination of several company-controlledconcerns that resulted in a 53.5 mln dlr charge, CooperDevelopment said.    Last August Cooper Development combined its CooperBiomedical Inc unit and its Cooper Laboratories subsidiary withTechnicon Instruments Corp, a company acquired from Revlon Inc&lt;REV>, a Cooper spokesman said.    The spokesman said the transaction was accounted for as anacquisition, but the Securities and Exchange Commission tookissue with the accounting method and said it should beaccounted for as a reorganization of entities under commoncontrol.    This treatment requires that the costs associated with thetransaction be expanded rather than capitalized as anintangible asset, the company said.    It also said that, since the charged required an expensingof previously accrued liabilities, the company will experienceno resulting material change it its cash flow. Reuter&#3;
