The Reserve Bank of New Zealand saidthere was no evidence to suggest the fall in share prices hadaffected financial stability and it would maintain its firmmonetary policy.    Governor Spencer Russell said in a statement the centralbank did not accept arguments that the battle against inflationshould now take a low second priority after the sharemarket'splunge.    Russell said the bank had two statutory responsibilities --to implement the government's monetary policy to bring downinflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability.    "Unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetarypolicy will continue because it is very much in the nationalinterest that it do so," he said.    "And there is yet no evidence available to the bank tosuggest that the fall in share prices has affected thestability of the financial sector."
