The five-nation &lt;International AeroEngine> (IAE) consortium has decided not to go ahead with theproposed launch of its Superfan engine, a spokesman forconsortium member &lt;Rolls-Royce Plc> said.    He said a group board meeting had concluded that a launchwould have been premature given the risks involved in trying tomeet an availability date of Spring, 1992 required by airlines.    However, he added that the project had not been cancelledand could be offered later on.    The engine was originally proposed for fitting on the&lt;Airbus Industrie> A340.    IAE's members are Rolls, United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N>Pratt and Whitney, Fiat SpA &lt;FIAT.MI> &lt;Japanese Aero EnginesCorp> and &lt;MTU> of West Germany.    Airbus said this week it would switch to the Franco-U.S.CFM-56-S3 alternative because of doubts whether the Superfanwould be ready on time.    Rolls, which has been state-owned since 1971, launches its"pathfinder" prospectus giving preliminary details of its publicflotation later today.    Analysts said that the timing of the postponement ofSuperfan -- an 30,000 pound thrust upgrade of the consortium'sV2500 engine fitted to the A320 -- was embarrassing but shouldnot be considered a serious blow. If anything, it indicated thefinancial prudence of the group, one added.    The Rolls spokesman added that the decision did not affectthe V2500 programme itself. Equally, there was the possibilitythat the consortium would go ahead with the Superfan later on.    Rolls RB211 engine was not available for fitting to earlyversions of the Boeing Co &lt;BA.N> 747 but had since capturedabout 25 pct of the market, he noted. REUTER&#3;
