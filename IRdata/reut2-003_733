Attorney General Edwin Meese said hesaw some benefit in the proposed purchase of American Motors Co&lt;AMO> By Chrysler Corp &lt;C> in that it would return the smallestof the U.S. auto manufacturers to American hands.    Meese told the House Appropriations Subcommittee thatconsideration would be part of the Justice Department's reviewof the proposed merger. He said the agency has not yet receiveda formal notice of the merger which would start the reviewprocess.   Chrysler has made a 1.3 billion dlr bid to buy AMC from itsFrench parent Renault.    "I think one of the things that has to be recognized in thatmerger is that it appears, at least, that a good portion of theownership of American Motors, which has been in overseas handswill be put back in American hands," Meese told thesubcommittee.    "That may be one of the factors that would be weighed in thejudgment," he added.    Renault currently holds about 46 pct of AMC. Reuter&#3;
