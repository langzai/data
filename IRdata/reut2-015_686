U.S. retailers' lackluster March saleswere due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect arecovery in April.    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, butunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate," saidBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.     Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. Thisyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is threeweeks later than last year.    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted5.7 pct last year.    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicatethat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appearto be because liquidity and employment are rising," saidanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming inaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expectedto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticketitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to manyanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as theholiday nears.    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect acontinuing strength in the housing market," said EdwardBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported anoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women'ssportswear were also excellent.    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but evena modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishmentdue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.     J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> wereamong the weaker performers with comparable stores salesdeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store andcatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson'soverall sales rose 4.8 pct.    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continuedstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged fromvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressedsouthwest."    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activitywear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of BearStearns.    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter forthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a toughercomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lowerthan last year.    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories arebeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but salesare coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning ofthe year.    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle ofMay.
