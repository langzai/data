Genentech Inc said it fileda suit against the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S.District Court for the District of Columbia over an unresolvedissue relating to genetically engineered human growth hormone.    At issue, said Genentech, is whether Eli Lilly and Co's&lt;ELI> recombinant human growth hormone and its new recombinantgrowth hormone, are the same drug. Both drugs are under reviewby the FDA.    Since 1985, Genentech has been marketing Protropin, arecombinant human growth hormone for treating abnormally shortchildren.    The biotechnology concern said it has the right to sevenyears of exclusive marketing for Protropin, granted orphan drugstatus by the FDA. Orphan drugs are a special category of drugsthat are used to treat rare diseases.    Genentech said the suit seeks clarification of whatconstitutes a drug under the standards of the orphan Drug Act.It suggested that without the "clarification," companies thatdevelop orphan drugs may not recover development costs duringthe period of marketing exclusivity.    It said Lilly's growth hormone and its new growth hormonediffer slightly, and are produced by different processes. Reuter&#3;
