Spanish farmers took their tractors tothe roads today and blocked a border crossing with France in aprotest against the Socialist government's EC policies,officials said.    Protestors set cars ablaze and cut off traffic in the Riojawine growing district, while they blocked roads with tractorconvoys in other northern regions such as Saragossa, where5,000 farmers joined the demonstrations.    Farmers blockaded the border crossing with France at LaJunquera near Barcelona, refusing to allow lorries from otherEuropean countries to enter Spain.    Spanish farmers have been protesting for the past two weeksto demand a better deal within the Community. The farm protestcame in the wake of demonstrations last night in over 30 citiesin which workers marched for wage rises and against job losses.    But the turnout, regarded as a dress rehearsal for ageneral strike next month, disappointed the communist-ledWorkers Commissions union organisers. The ruling SocialistParty's trade union arm, the General Workers' Union, did notjoin in.    More than 20 strikes are planned for this month and next inthe transport sector, with stoppages at the state-owned Iberiaand Aviaco airlines and RENFE railways. Reuter&#3;
