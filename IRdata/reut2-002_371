Azpurua was commenting in a television interview onFriday's agreement to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct overLibor from 1-1/8 pct and extend the period to 14 years from12-1/2.    He said in addition to the reduction in amortizations overthe next three years sought by the government, agreed at 1.35billion dlrs instead of 3.335 billion, Venezuela will also payless in the subsequent three years. The accord runs till 1999.    Azpurua said that in 1990, payments of restructured debtare lowered to 1.05 billion dlrs from 1.339 mln, to 1.25billion from 1.994 mln in 1991 and to 1.45 billion from 2.403billion in 1992.    He said the contingency clause implemented by Venezuelasoon after the original rescheduling was signed in February1986 stays in effect and that the new payment schedule is basedon an assumption of oil prices varying between 15 and 18 dlrs abarrel.
