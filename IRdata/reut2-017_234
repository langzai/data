Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawatold a parliamentary Upper House budget committee that he doesnot think the dollar is in a freefall.    He said concerted intervention is only a supplementarymeasure to moderate volatility in exchange rates and repeatedthat policy coordination among major industrial nations isnecessary. "We cannot expect currency stability only throughcoordinated market intervention," he said.    Miyazawa also told the committee the U.S. Has not called onJapan to cut its 2.5 pct discount rate.    Miyazawa said the government is not considering investingin U.S. Government bonds to help stabilize exchange rates. Thismatter has to be dealt with carefully because it involves thepublic's money and exchange rates are moving widely, he added.    The ministry will consider where to invest its funds whenexchange rates become stable, he said.    Asked if Japan is considering a request to the U.S. For itto raise its discount rate to stabilize exchange rates,Miyazawa said the U.S. Has not been able to take action nowbecause it has to maintain its economic growth.
