Stocks of tobacco companies rosesharply as investors grew more confident that an excise taxwould not be imposed on tobacco, traders and analysts said.    They also said the stocks are relatively inexpensive sincefear of the tax and of pending litigation regarding warninglabels for tobacco products have kept many investors awayrecently.    Philip Morris Cos &lt;MO> rose 2-5/8 to 87-3/4, RJR Nabisco&lt;RJR> 1-1/4 to 57-1/2 and U.S. Tobacco &lt;UBO> 7/8 to 27.    "The near-term activity of these stocks has been dominatedby external factors such as smoking restriction legislation,concern over liability suits and the possible imposition ofexcise taxes," Dean Witter analyst Lawrence Adelman said. "Butthe feeling is that many of those externals have beendiscounted in the price of the stocks."    Adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on PhilipMorris earlier this week, said there have been indications thatthe Reagan Administration's staunch opposition to tax hikeswould short-circuit attempts to tax tobacco.    "The tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumerstocks because of these external factors," Adelman said. "Theyare not for the weak-hearted, but they offer a lot of value forthe aggressive investor."    In a market where everyone is looking for affordablestocks, trader Drew Schaefer of Kidder Peabody said, it is nothard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressedfor a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.    Adelman believes one of the better buys is Philip Morris."It is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividendsand free cash flow. And the stock is cheap now," he said.    Adelman expects Morris to earn eight dlrs a share this yearcompared to 6.20 dlrs a share earned a year ago. In 1988, thecompany should report a profit 10.30 dlrs a share. Reuter&#3;
