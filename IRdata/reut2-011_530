Undersecretary of State MichaelArmacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings withhigh-level officials that will include talks on the growingtrade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products.    He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japansince President Reagan announced last week plans to imposetariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods onApril 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live upto a pact on microchip trade signed last September.    Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said thetrip is set for April 6 to 8.    U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held eachyear at this time, she told reporters.    The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign MinisterRyohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus onU.S.-Japanese foreign aid programs and political securityissues of mutual concern, she added.    "Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations isexpected, the talks are not directly related to U.S.-Japanesetrade relations," she insisted.    But, in response to questions, Oakley acknowledged thattrade will be discussed.   Japan's 58.6 billion dlrs trade surplus with the UnitedStates last year has come under fire in Congress, which isconcerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition andwith the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. Trade deficit in 1986.
