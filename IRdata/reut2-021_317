IC Industries Inc said its board approveda second major step in the reorganization and restructuring ofthe company.    To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus onconsumer goods and services, the company will give seriousconsideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace anddefense company, if it can realize a price which will returnmaximum value to shareholders.    In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrson sales of 900.5 mln dlrs.    IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale toinvest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods andservices field.    The company said it authorized a program to repurchasebetween 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stockfrom time to time when conditions warrant.    It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reductionprogram to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs.    An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved"across-the-board" cuts rather than specific about targetedareas.    IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off thecompany's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad to shareholders. Thecompany's other major subsidiaries are Pet Inc, Pepsi-ColaGeneral Bottlers, Midas International Corp and Hussmann Corp. Reuter&#3;
