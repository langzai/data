Sales of U.S.-built new cars surgedduring the last 10 days of March to the second highest levelsof 1987, indicating that car buying may have fully reboundedfrom its January slump.    Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time inyears, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers.    For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakerssold 282,358 new cars, up 19.3 pct from late March 1986, givingthe industry an annualized sales rate of 8.1 mln cars. Thatrate a year ago was 6.9 mln cars.    "The last 10 days of March was the second strongest 10-dayperiod we've had this year," said David Healy at Drexel BurnhamLambert.    "We've had a slow recovery since January, and these latestfigures build on that. This lends some encouragement to theidea that we're looking at a pretty strong year," he said.    In early February sales were up briefly to 8.3 mln units onan annual basis, before dropping again.    Car buyers had rushed to dealer showrooms in December totake advantage of expiring tax deductions, taking away fromnormal January selling.    But a slowly expanding economy, an exploding stock marketand a growing array of incentives have lured customers todealers' showrooms, analysts said.   Ford Motor Co &lt;F> sales jumped 29.5 pct in the period to79,249 cars from 61,169 a year ago. For the month, the nation'ssecond largest carmaker said sales increased 17.8 pct to197,328 compared to 167,490.    Chrysler Corp &lt;C> reported a 20.2 pct sales jump to 40,454compared with 33,669. In all of March it sold 96,649, up 6.3pct from 90,945.    Industry giant General Motors's sales rose a more modest6.2 pct for late March to 140,522 verses 132,298 last year. Butsales for the full month dropped 5.6 pct to 349,578 from370,390.    Also helping the U.S.-based industry, analysts said, is theslackening demand for imports, which suffered the first salesdecline in memory.    "Imports will need more and more sales incentives, aphenomenon unheard of two years ago," said Scott Merlis atMorgan Stanley. "Import prices have risen 17 pct on average, sothey've become more sensitive to weaker demand in general."    General Motors market share for the period fell to 48.2pct, below the 51 pct for the first three months of the yearand far below the 56 pct of most of last year.    Ford's market share was 28.1 pct, up from 27.7 pct for thefirst three months, while Chrysler's share was 14.3 pct, a risefrom 13.7 pct since the start of the year.    Falling market share at General Motors apparently promptedthe company to decide this week to close six plants for a weekto bring supply into line with demand.    But Ronald Glantz at Montgomery Securities said furtherproduction cuts might be necessary.    "While GM has just taken 100,00 units out of second quarterproduction already because of weak sales, the continuation ofthis weakening market share suggests another production cutbackis likely," Glantz said.    Other carmakers with U.S plants posted these results duringthe March 21 to 31 period -- American Motors Corp &lt;AMC> 1,198,down 50 pct, Volkswagen 2,145, down from 3,342, American Honda16,635, up from 6,358, and Nissan 4,635, up from 2,536.
