In a novel type of financing, TexasInstruments Inc marketed a three-part, 225 mln dlr issue ofconvertible money market preferred stock through ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc as sole manager.    Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept,said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In thefirst, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strikeprice of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over thecommon stock price when terms were set.    Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividendpreferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium.    Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 2-1/8.    Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that"demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for thefirst tranche."    He said that Shearson originated the concept of auctionmoney market preferred stock three years ago. The conversionfeature of this issue is the new wrinkle.    Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that theoriginal pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intensedemand, saving the issuer money in financing costs.    The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of thefirst tranche received less than they wanted. He said thelatter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed.    Like non-convertible money market preferred stock, the newversion allows investors to redeem their holdings every sevenweeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them,or offer to hold on to the securities if the auctiondividend is at least at a level they specify in advance.    Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range ofinvestors, including major insurance companies, banks, moneymanagers and pension funds. Reuter&#3;
