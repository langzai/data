Federal Reserve Board Vice ChairmanManuel Johnson said the rapid recent growth in corporate andhousehold debt burdens posed risks to the economy but should bekept in perspective.    The heavy debt load "is one of our major concerns ... therisks are significant," he said in response to questions fromthe Eastern Economic Association, an academic group.    However, he added, the recent bull market on Wall Streethad also made corporate equity levels soar, keeping corporatedebt to equity ratios about constant.    Similarly, he said household net worth has increased at afaster pace than household debt "so that household debt-to-assetratios have once again gone down."    Nonetheless, "I think that it's something to watchcarefully, and obviously it's something we do," he said. Reuter&#3;
