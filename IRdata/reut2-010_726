The government is determined to ride outthe latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measuresbecause it expects the currency's appreciation to provetemporary, senior officials said.    "The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) andmarket forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit," one seniorFinance Ministry official said.    He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to specialfactors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead ofthe March 31 end to their fiscal year.    That selling largely came to an end this morning afterabout one hour of trading here, the senior official said. "They(the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock(0100 GMT)," he said.    After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning,the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20.Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilisethe dollar above 150 yen.    Several officials said they did not see any fundamentalreason for the dollar's recent sharp fall.    One official even called the market's recent actionsirrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs onJapanese electronics goods should support the dollar againstthe yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., Hesaid.    As a result, several officials said they saw no reason toalter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at lastmonth's meeting of major nations in Paris.    "We don't see any substantial reason to change our policystance," one senior official said.&#3;
