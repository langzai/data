A solution to Brazil's debt problemsis unthinkable without the involvement of the InternationalMonetary Fund, Juergen Sarrazin, management board member ofDresdner Bank AG responsible for Latin America said.    Sarrazin told the business daily Handelsblatt that Brazil'sinterest payments moratorium had cost it the goodwill of manybanks.    "Now there will certainly be no solutions without the IMF,"he said. "Alternatives which could be imagined before, such asbringing the IMF in with us in a loose form, are over," he said.    Sarrazin, who through Dresdner represents German banks inseveral rescheduling coordinating committees, noted that Brazilwas still prepared to negotiate.    But he said work in the coordinating committees had alreadyrun into difficulties before Brazil's interest moratorium.    Justified calls by debtors for more flexibility from thebanks were blocked because U.S. Regulations made solutions suchas capitalising of interest virtually impossible, he said.    Although many European banks were opposed to the use ofinterest capitalisation, "this was an alternative which has tobe brought in," Sarrazin said. REUTER&#3;
