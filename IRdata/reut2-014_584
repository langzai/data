Good rains of one to four inches in thepast 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops inthe Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, anAustralian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.    As previously reported, the region has been undergoing asevere dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, sinceDecember, following the virtual failure of the summer wetseason.    Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops arebeginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growthsince the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.    Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much betterthan it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesmansaid. But is too early to say what they will be and more rainis needed to restore sub-soil moisture.    Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg regionand southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition andsome mills are forecasting record crops, he said.    Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiledtowards the end of May, he said.    The cane crush normally runs from June to December. REUTER&#3;
