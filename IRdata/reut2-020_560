The Securities and Exchange Commissionsaid it made a one-day exception to its rule of prohibitingcompanies from repurchasing their own stock in the last halfhour of trading, and allowed firms to continue stockrepurchases until the close of market.    An SEC spokesperson told Reuters that the rule exceptiononly covered repurchases made today.    Analysts said that widespread stock repurchases by manyfirms today were a contributing factor in the market's reboundfrom yesterday's huge losses.    The rule prohibiting repurchases in the final half-hour oftrading works to prevent rapid end-of-day stock price riseswhich could be caused by a company's open-market purchase ofits own stock at the end of a trading session, the spokespersonsaid.    Share repurchases today were called "a smart way to usecorporate equity," by one SEC staff member who refused to beidentified. Reuter&#3;
