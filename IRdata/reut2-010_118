No negotiated solution is insight to a three-day-old national strike by the majority ofBrazil's 700,000 bankworkers, a spokesman for the NationalFederation of Banks said.    The private bankers would rather wait until next Monday,when a labour court is due to judge the legality of thestoppage, the spokesman said. The bankworkers are demanding a100 pct pay rise.    "The workers are breaking an agreement signed six monthsago. If the banks agreed to grant them 100 pct now, soonworkers would have to be laid off and in some cases even bankswould run out of business," the spokesman told Reuters.    He said only the state-controlled Banco do Brasil was onthe verge of negotiating an accord with its workers. Reuter&#3;
