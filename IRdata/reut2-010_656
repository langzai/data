The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX),a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend itstrading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets,exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.    He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the thirdquarter this year.    The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serveclients in the region and educate financial markets about theadvantages of currency options, Giordano said.    Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour byexchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of theexchange-trade currency option market against existingover-the-counter option trading during the local working day.    Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had becomean accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk andhad grown in popularity, he said.    The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, includinga new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30billion U.S. Dlrs.    Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with theperformance of its Australian dollar contract, which since itsintroduction last year had regularly topped the French franc asthe third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000contracts traded daily.    Having the Philadelphia exchange open during theAsia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increasearbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuriesaccess to a currency option market of much greater depth andliquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.
