Japan has pledged to try to increaseits purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data tomonitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said.    U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japaneseofficials to try to force open the Japanese market toAmerican-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated fivebillion dlr deficit in car parts trade.    Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-madeparts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contractsfor parts purchases, a Commerce department official said.    He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to tryto devise a way to collect purchasing information in order tomonitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.    The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that"statistics support the perception in the United States thatAmerican auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the innercircles of Japan's auto companies and their traditionalsuppliers."    It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost fivebillion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S.firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market. reuter&#3;
