A 50 pct cut in the import tariff forsoybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan,a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers toldReuters.    He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by thecabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.    The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, hesaid. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.    Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from theU.S. And the rest from South America.    The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Isin line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan's tradesurplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrsin the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.    "The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (whowant) to boost their exports to Taiwan," Steve Chen, countrydirector of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters. REUTER&#3;
