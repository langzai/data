Britain's ruling Conservatives have anine point lead over the main opposition Labour Party, theirbiggest in two years, according to an opinion poll published inthe Sunday Times.    The MORI poll's findings come as the latest in a series ofsetbacks for Labour and are bound to encourage talk that PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher may call a general election in June.    The poll gives the Conservatives a rating of 41 pct against32 pct for Labour and 25 pct for the centrist Liberal-SocialDemocratic Alliance -- enough to give Thatcher an overallmajority of 46 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons.    The poll, which follows a survey by Marplan last weekgiving the Conservatives a six-point lead over Labour, showshow dramatically the fortunes of Britain's two largest partieshave changed over the past six months.    As recently as September, Labour was still ahead in opinionpolls and was looking forward to forming Britain's nextgovernment. Since then, it has been beset by inner wranglingand its popularity among Britain's voters has tumbled.    Morale among Labour politicians slumped further last monthwhen the party lost a key by-election in Greenwich, southLondon -- a seat which Labour had held for 50 years. REUTER&#3;
