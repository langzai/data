U.K. Officials are studying the possiblelink between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and thespread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, aMinistry of Agriculture official said.    A study published in the New England Journal of Medicineyesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain ofsalmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol hadbeen shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promotethe growth of cattle.   The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with theDepartment of Health and the Public Health Laboratory toinvestigate the whole subject of resistant strains ofsalmonella.    "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possibleeffects on human and animal health," the official said. Thegovernment is also studying a recommendation from the FarmAnimal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calvesunder 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this wouldhelp reduce the spread of salmonella. Reuter&#3;
