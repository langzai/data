British Foreign Secretary Sir GeoffreyHowe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oilplatform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulfcrisis.    "The United States is fully entitled to take military actionin exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of theimminent threat of further attacks," Howe said in a statementissued in London.    The United States said its forces destroyed the platform onMonday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.    Referring to that attack, Howe added, "I trust the Iranianswill fully understand that continued attacks of this kind willonly enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."    At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting ofEuropean Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked aboutstatements from a senior Iranian official who said America wasnow involved in a full-scale war.    "It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustifiedfor Iran to react in that way," he said. Reuter&#3;
