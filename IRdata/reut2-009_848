He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposurein loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debtpayments. If a default does occur, it would first quarterearnings by about five cts a share, which would bring thebank's in the lower level of the estimated range, he added.    Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 ctsgain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year.    Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, notincluding its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mlndlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs ayear earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986.    He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loanswhich he expects will be ultimately repaid after the companyrecovers from an earthquake earlier this year.    Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican andVenezuelan loans as those nations are also facing creditproblems.    Brown said the Bank of Boston remains "cautiously optimiticabout the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to beon nonaccural all year."
