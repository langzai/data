A top U.S. Official said Japan has littlechance of persuading the U.S. to drop threatened tradesanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left forWashington today.    Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for PoliticalAffairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's movesto boost its domestic economy and open its markets couldpersuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese importssaid, and replied: "...It is probably too early for the figuresto demonstrate that the situation has turned around and topermit the result you have described."    Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to liftits domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, removebarriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.    "There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,but we do not wish those problems to divert attention fromimportant areas of cooperation that continue to exist onsecurity and political issues," he said.    "The question is whether through cooperative actions betweenour governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whetherCongress takes action to reduce it through protectionistlegislation," he said.
