The U.S. should reassessits Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence onimported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center forStrategic and International Studies.     "The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from theGulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commissionreport, mandate more than ever before the need for afundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,"Ebinger said.     He remarks were made in an address to the NationalPetroleum Refiners Association meeting.     "Although in the short run it is difficult to see a directlink between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in thecurrent environment it will be increasingly difficult formoderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.interests," Ebinger said.     Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crudeoil prices strong recently although some believe prices will beweaker if demand falls in the spring.    But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, saidcrude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.    There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking atthe annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chancethat crude oil prices could move higher in the second half ofthe year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.    He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreementto restrict production.    OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in Junebecause the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  hasdeclined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.    OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollarhas fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.    Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 tofour mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 totwo mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd. Reuter&#3;
