Finance Minister Roger Douglas saideight bond tenders of 250 mln dlrs each are planned for theyear ending March 1988.    Douglas said in a statement the June quarter borrowingprogram will not include a May tender, but a 250 mln dlr tenderwill be held on June 11.    Overfunding in 1986/87 has removed the need for a Maytender, he said.    Preliminary estimates put net public sector injections for1987/88 year at 2.1 billion dlrs.    The fiscal deficit for 1987/88 is forecast at 2.2 billiondlrs compared with a forecast of 2.45 billion for 1986/87 and1.87 billion a year earlier.    However, Douglas said the 1987/88 estimate is subject touncertainties over the results of pre-budget spending reviewsand tax forecasts and over the effect the program of"corporatising" certain government departments will have onliquidity.    Douglas said whatever the outcome of these influences thenet public sector injections will continue to be fully fundedon a fiscal year basis. REUTER&#3;
