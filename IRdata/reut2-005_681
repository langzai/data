Harbour workers returned to workthis morning after a strike in support of pay claims closed NewZealand's 15 ports for 24 hours yesterday.    But the Harbour Workers Union told reporters the paydispute is not settled and the union's national executive willmeet here tomorrow to decide its next moves.    "Obviously we will be considering further industrial action,"Union secretary Ross Wilson said in a radio interview.    The union rejects employers offers of a 7.5 pct pay riseover 15 months. It wants 7.0 pct over 12 months. Reuter&#3;
