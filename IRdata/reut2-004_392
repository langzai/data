A proposal the London Metal Exchange,LME, change its new clearing system, due to start May 29, wasmade today at a meeting of LME members and InternationalCommodities Clearing House, ICCH, representatives.    Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, proposed that a dailycash-cleared system common to all other markets should beadopted, rather than the system currently planned wherebyprompt dates are settled when they mature.    AMT claims the margin requirements for the latter will becostly.    Opposition to the proposal came mainly from trade andindustry representatives who, as traditional users of theExchange's hedging facilities, said a cash-cleared system wouldbe more costly for them.    LME Board Chairman Jacques Lion said any major alterationsto the planned new clearing system would have to be referred tothe Securities and Investment Board, SIB, and this could betime consuming, bearing in mind the May 29 start-up.    There was also a risk of the Exchange losing its greatestasset, its trade hedging business, he said.    Lion accepted a proposal that, while clearing with the ICCHcontinue as planned, details of AMT's cash clearing system becirculated for consideration and discussion by LME Board,Committee and members for possible introduction at a laterdate.    The LME also said that Japanese yen contracts will now beexcluded from clearing as they are not used widely enough towarrant inclusion. Reuter&#3;
