India has called a fresh buying tenderfor up to four 13,000 tonne cargoes of white sugar on March 11,traders here said.    The tender calls for one cargo of prompt sugar and two tothree with March/April shipment sugar, or the same as the eightcargoes bought at a tender two days ago. That tender originallyonly sought two to three cargoes but resulted in the sale ofeight. India also granted the sellers options to sell twicethat amount at the same price but for April/May shipment.    Depending on prices, traders said it would be likely forIndia again to buy more than the tonnage formally sought. Reuter&#3;
