BankAmerica Corp Chairman A.W.Clausen said the bank holding company is turning around and isback on the road to profitability.    In a speech to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce,Clausen said he was "absolutely convinced" BankAmerica wouldreturn to its position of preeminence.    "Fundamental to achieving that goal is to continue toreduce costs dramatically, to get our arms around our loan lossproblems and begin to reduce charge-offs, and to enhance ourrevenue generation," Clausen said.    Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a positionthis year to make any acquisitions or experience any growth.    He said BankAmerica will continue to reduce staff andoperations, noting that expense growth in 1986 increased onlyone pct over 1985 expenses.    Clausen also said it will continue to phase out itsoverseas retail banking and concentrate on wholesale banking,with emphasis on a premium list of multinational corporations.   Reuter&#3;
