The French government has no reason todoubt the European Airbus consortium's assessment that its A340long-range jet project has a sound commercial basis, FrenchTrade Minister Michel Noir said .    Airbus announced last Friday that it had 104 firm ordersand options from nine airlines for its A340 long-range and A330medium-range jet projects.    "If Airbus finds an initial cushion of around one hundredaircraft satisfactory, we have no reason to contradict them,"Noir told journalists. Reuter&#3;
