Homestake Mining Co is consideringacquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company'sexploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reutersin an interview.    Conger said, "the move to consider acquisitions representsa change in the company's acquistions policy."    Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs whichhave not been drawn on and could be used to finance anacquisition, he said.    Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will beabout the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.    Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightlyhigher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil andgas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's9.6 pct.    Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production aboutthe same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.    However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlinreserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400ounces due to start-up production problems.    He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987. Reuter&#3;
