Current interest by Soviet charterers intaking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. Tocarry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recentsurge in values on the Baltic International Freight FuturesExchange (BIFFEX), dealers said.    Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today forthe first time in the spot position since the market opened inMay 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with valuessome 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which iscalculated on spot physical rates.    No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings butthey have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which wouldnormally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.    "It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effecton its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported," one said.    Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route havesubsequently been the main beneficiary of current charteringconditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left forthe remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risensteadily for vessels loading next month.    Dealers said there is even talk that owners are consideringtaking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.    Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chineseoperators may be in the market for similar timecharter businesslater in the year, they said.    They anticipate this would appear around June and it hasprompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite itnormally being a slack time in the shipping year.    Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Ratesturned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which hadsupported the market at the start of the year, faltered butthen recovered on the reported Soviet interest. Reuter&#3;
