President Reagan, ending four monthsof semi-isolation from the press, will hold a televised newsconference on Thursday, the White House said.    Reagan is certain to be questioned extensively at the 2000EST/0100 gmt session about the secret sale of arms to Iran andskimming of profits to aid U.S.-backed "contra" rebels inNicaragua.    During his last news conference on November 19, 1986 -- sixdays before the fund diversion came to light -- Reagan stronglydefended the clandestine arms operation.    During that session, the president also denied any thirdcountry involvement in the Iran initiative even though it wasalready known that Israel had played a key role in the armsshipments. The White House was forced to issue a correctionfollowing the news conference.    Reagan's fumbling performance in that encounter withreporters helped contribute to a sharp decline in his jobapproval rating in various public opinion polls.    Since the November 19 news conference, Reagan --whomaintains he knew nothing about the contra diversion -- hasrevised his position on his covert Iran policy. Reuter&#3;
