A maximum budget deficit of 2.5 billiondlrs for fiscal 1987/88 ending June 30 is needed if financialmarkets are to be impressed with the government's resolve totackle Australia's economic problems, Westpac Banking Corp&lt;WSTP.S> said.    This compares with the budgeted deficit of 3.5 billion dlrsfor the current 1986/87 year although the market expects theactual shortfall to be some 500 mln dlrs higher.    In its latest Economic Review, Westpac said powerfularguments could be advanced for eliminating the deficitaltogether next year or even budgeting for a modest surplus.    Westpac said such a policy would deliver the message thegovernment was determined to face deep-seated economicproblems. But it said it would be a great deal to expect of agovernment in what was probably an election year.    It said even a relatively minor cut in the deficit wouldrequire some unpleasant decisions, noting a repeat of the1986/87 budget's zero real growth in spending would only bringthe deficit to about 4.3 billion dlrs.    A cut of greater than two pct in real terms was needed if a2.5 billion dlr deficit was to be achieved and this requiredsome radical surgery to existing programs, the bank said.    Westpac said the government's mid-May mini-budget providedan opportunity for bold measures, both in relation to the sizeof the government's role in the economy and the principlesgoverning that activity, notably indexation of outlays.    It said official figures show 93 pct of outlays in some wayindexed, hard to justify when living standards outside thepublic sector were being eroded.    In current circumstances, the alternative to fiscaldiscipline is the sure road to bigger external debts, furthercurrency depreciation, a boost to inflation and, ultimately,capital flight, the bank said.
