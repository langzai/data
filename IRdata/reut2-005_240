Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceedthe central banks' limits and real growth of their grossnational products, it said.    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increasedindustrial demand and higher expected coin production, the banksaid.    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price onfutures markets, has also risen.
