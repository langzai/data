Algerian and Spanish producers whichtogether meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs inquicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said.    The agreement was made during a meeting here last weekbetween Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux etSubstances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss themarket situation.    The two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted bysome specialised publications do not reflect the reality of thewhole market since they take into account only part of thedeals made," a statement by ENOF said.    The result is that the prices quoted are far away from twofirms' production costs.    "They have thus decided that their selling price would notbe linked any more to the prices quoted by these publicationsand that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fobper jar, which is close to their production cost," the statementsaid.    It added that Turkish producers would join in when the twofirms meet again in Madrid later this month.    The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchangehovered around 200 dlrs this week.
