Brooklyn Union Gas &lt;BU>, a New York gasutility company, said it will try to limit any rate hikes tocustomers by arranging alternative supplies to replace the spotnatural gas that Transco Energy Co &lt;E> no longer delivers, acompany official told Reuters.    Edward Sondey, vice president of supply, said that under agrandfather clause Brooklyn Union could request Transco totransmit 165 mln cubic feet (mcf) a day of spot natural gasafter purchasing 250 mcf of contract gas from Transco.    Brooklyn Union has been taking only 30 pct, or 75 mcf, ofthe contract gas from Transco, and acquiring about 120 mcf onthe spot, or non-contract, market, he said.    Lacking access to spot gas through Transco would not costBrooklyn Union more than 50 cts per mln btu for now,Sondey said, as Transco contract gas costs 2.55 dlrs per mlncompared to about two dlrs for spot gas.    "The rate increase will not be serious," Sondey said.    The contract price at 2.55 dlrs per mln BTU has beeneffective since May 1 after Transco lowered its commodity rateto reflect seasonal weakness, making it the lowest in the 12months ended May 31, according to report submitted by BrooklynUnion to New York Public Utility Commission.    In peak demand season, Transco's contract gas reached ashigh as 4.30 to 4.40 dlrs per mln btu, a commission officialsaid.    Industry analysts expected little adverse effect frominterrupted spot supplies on Brooklyn Union's earnings for itscurrent fiscal year ending September 30.    But if the open access problem to Transco is not resolvedthis winter, high cost of contract gas could cut into thecompany's profit, they said. Reuter&#3;
