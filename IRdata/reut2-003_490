European CommunityCommission President Jacques Delors said he met with strongobjections from some EC government heads to his radical planfor changes to Community financing.    In a speech to the European Parliament, Delors said some ECleaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allowadditional resources for the bloc when they were themselvespruning their own spending.    Others called for major spending cut in the EC'scontroversial farm policy in order to free money for regionaland social development.    The Parliament later registered its support for the Delorsplan by voting to approve his continuation in office for asecond two-year term.    Delors has proposed that payments by member states to theEC should be based on their gross national product instead ofon the amount of value added tax they receive. He said thiswould increase EC resources and provide a fairer system ofsharing the financial burden.    He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints aboutincreased payments, he had told some heads of government theCommunity needs more money.    Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need toreform the EC farm policy, which currently accounts for overtwo thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget."We have to askfor sacrifices but we have to create a future for thosefarmers."    He added, "I was forced to say to some heads of government -Do you want to destroy this common market in agriculture whenyou are asking for a common market in goods and services?"    EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuineinternal market in industrial products and services.    Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasinggroup resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes. REUTER&#3;
