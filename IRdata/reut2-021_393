The thriving market in Luxembourgfranc bond issues has been temporarily stalled by the Belgiangovernment crisis which has put the franc under pressure andforced up interest rates, banking sources said.    On Monday, King Baudouin accepted the resignation ofBelgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and askedhim to try to form a new government.    Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA(BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourgfrancs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGLdirector Robert Sharfe said.    He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week.    It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interestrates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, bankingsources said. However, no new placements are scheduled foranother 10 days.    The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp(SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issuesthe interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct.    Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in paritywith the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates.    On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-monthTreasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgianfranc came under pressure.    Private placements in Luxembourg francs have becomeincreasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers,because they carry a relatively low interest rate.    Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg francbond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strongcurrency. REUTER&#3;
