The speaker of the Iranian Parliament,Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, warned the U.S. Not tointervene in the Gulf, a day after Washington said its warshipswere available to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway.    "If U.S. Intervention occurs, the entire world will becomeinsecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could berepeated for the Americans everywhere," he said.    U.S. Defence officials disclosed in Washington yesterdaythat the U.S. Navy, which has about 24 warships in or near theGulf, was prepared to escort Kuwaiti tankers, regular targetsfor Iranian attacks in an offshoot of its war with Iraq.    Rafsanjani, in an interview reported by the Iranian newsagency IRNA, also commented on earlier U.S. Disclosures thatIran had erected sites for new Chinese-made Silkwormanti-shipping missiles at the Strait of Hormuz.    The agency, received in London, quoted him as saying thatIran did not need missiles to close the strait, 24 miles wideat its narrowest, because "we can close it with artillery only."    He added "We have the longest coasts and the highestinterest here and the small southern (Gulf) states have alesser interest compared with us and therefore it is naturalfor us to protect the security of the Strait of Hormuz morethan others."
