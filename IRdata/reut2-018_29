A representative of the poultryindustry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequentlythe cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products orsalads and other mixed foods.    Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industriesand a director of the National Broiler Council, told a HouseAgriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chickenhas not increased in recent years and that chicken is neitherthe major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of anincrease in outbreaks of the disease.    May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed thatbetween 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of allU.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pctof outbreaks and dairy products six pct.    May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads andmixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.    May said the chicken industry favored moving away frombird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment systembetter able to identify microbial and bacterial contaminationof poultry.    However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice forFood and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should beretained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cookchicken to remind consumers about preparation proceduresnecessary to avoid illness.    Haas also called for a review of present chicken industryinspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards. Reuter&#3;
