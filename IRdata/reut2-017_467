Crude oil prices could remain around 18dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision onoutput at its next meeting would be the critical factor, anofficial of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president ofinternational trade, said current OPEC output already appearedto be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itselffor the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what wasoriginally planned, while demand is growing more slowly thanenvisaged a few months ago," he said.    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level ofproduction in the third quarter would effectively sustain the18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally beenenvisaged might soften price levels.    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 inVienna to review its December accord on prices and output.    "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude interms of volume decisions," Lajous said.    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boostedoutput and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, isalways there as a possibility, he said.    "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. Iexpect other oil exporters have learned their lessons anddiscipline will be maintained," he said.    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long asthis remains there will be a tendency to instability in oilmarkets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during1987 if output remains under control.    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, thatincreased production was not so important as long as incomeswould not be affected by the output, were "very relevant andwelcome from such a powerful producer."
