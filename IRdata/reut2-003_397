Japan's Finance Ministry auctioned 1,000billion yen worth of tankoku, six month debt-financing paper,to roll over previously issued tankoku maturing on March 19, aspokesman said.    The last tankoku auction, on February 12, produced a recordlow yield of 3.383 pct, reflecting expectation of a half pointcut in Japan's discount rate, he said.    In the previous auction for 1,000 billion yen, four majorJapanese securities houses took 92 pct of the issue amount inan attempt to meet strong demand from large institutionalinvestors, securities managers said.    Securities managers said they expect the auction to go wellagain this time as securities houses will try to expand theirinventories of tankoku on continuing good response frominstitutional investors.    Contrary to a projected low yield on tankoku, short-terminterest rates have been resisting a fall on growing demand forfunds ahead of the March 31 financial year-end, they said.    The Bank of Japan has been trying to dampen money marketrates to make the latest discount rate cut effective, but sofar in vain, dealers said.    The auction results will be announced tomorrow.
