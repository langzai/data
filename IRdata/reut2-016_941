The Supreme Court, in a 6-3decision, ruled that an Indiana law aimed at protectingcompanies from hostile takeovers by out-of-state businesses isconstitutional.    The high court justices reversed a ruling by a U.S. Courtof Appeals in Chicago that struck down the 1986 control-shareacquisition law.    The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corpof America against CTS Corp, based in Elkhart, Ind.    Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million sharesto bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company'stotal.       After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuitchallenging the constitutionality of the measure.    One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on thetender offer at the option of the target company.    It also requires that the acquisition for control shares inan Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless amajority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at theirnext regularly scheduled meeting.    Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the court majority, heldthat the state law was not pre-empted by federal securitieslaw.       "The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from thecoercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as agroup," he said.    He acknowledged that the law may delay some tender offersand may decrease the number of successful tender offers forIndiana corporations.    But he said the law does not discriminate againstinterstate commerce and was justified by the state's interestsin protecting shareholders.    Reuter&#3;
