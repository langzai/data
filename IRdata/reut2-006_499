Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY> said it wouldseek Food and Drug Administration permission to test its AIDSvaccine in humans by the end of March.    A company spokesman said the company will file aninvestigational new drug application by the end of the month,requesting the FDA to allow testing of the vaccine in humans.    Scientists at the company's Genetic Systems unit created anAIDS vaccine, which Bristol-Myers said produced antibodies tothe AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine consists ofsmallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDSvirus.    Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA wouldallow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues wouldhave to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backingtwo AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybridvirus is created that simulataneously immunizes againstsmallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.    The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of theAIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteinsand it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunityagainst AIDS. Reuter&#3;
