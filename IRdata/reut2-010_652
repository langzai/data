Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees thatare more than two years old and affected by the leaf diseasecorynespora, the head of the government's Rubber ResearchInstitute told Reuters.    Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years oldwould undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close aspossible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of thetree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded treesmature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos perhectare from the sixth year when they begin producing.    About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora.    Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, whichcauses leaves to fall off, De Mel said.    Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees.    De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as earlyas in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986that it became widespread.    The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how manytrees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will besprayed and remain under observation.    T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber ControllerDepartment, which monitors the industry, told Reutersreplanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken beforelate May when the monsoon rains begin.    De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptibleto corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.    The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreignclones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058.    Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced byPB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102.    These six varieties would also be used to replace treesuprooted or base-budded, De Mel said.    Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees perhectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge.    "But no compensation is contemplated at the moment," headded.    De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control thespread of the disease.    "The drought has not stopped the disease, but probablyhelped in some way because trees have not been affected inareas that are dry," he said.    Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because ithas not caused a drop in production.    Prices for the best latex crepe at the Colombo auction lastweek firmed to 20.19 rupees per kilo from 20.05 rupees at theprevious sale. REUTER&#3;
