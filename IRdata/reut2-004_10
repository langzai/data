A team of California researchers saidthat they have developed a better, faster test for detectingsickle cell anemia in unborn children than existing procedures.     The test, developed by Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS> researchers,requires only a small amount of genetic material from a fetusand produces a diagnosis within a day, unlike other tests thatrequire several days and can only be done in a few specializedcenters, they said.     Sickle cell anemia is a painful, inherited blood diseasethat causes the normally-flexible red blood cells to stiffeninto a sickle-like shape. It is primarily found in blacks.    The researchers said in The New England Journal of Medicinethat their "procedure promises to be a rapid, sensitive andreliable method for the prenatal diagnosis of sickle celldisease."     In addition, they said, the technique might also beadapted to detect other types of genetic disease. Reuter&#3;
