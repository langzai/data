Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio saidthe central bank was worried that money supply was growing toofast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanisheconomy, but added that he was confident recent measures wouldsucceed in restricting money growth.    In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubiosaid the main measure of money supply, the broad-based LiquidAssets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of17 pct in March, the same as in February.    The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.    Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.    He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was dueto a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pctreal drop in the contribution of the external sector.    The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but adrop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negativecomponent of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said. REUTER&#3;
