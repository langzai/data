Britain's centrist Liberal-SocialDemocratic Alliance has crept ahead of the opposition Labourparty to become the country's second political force, accordingto a Gallup opinion poll.    The poll, part of a survey carried out every week by Gallupon behalf of the ruling Conservative party, showed theConservatives with an eight-point lead at 38.5 pct, theAlliance at 30.5 and Labour at 30 pct.    It was published in the Sunday Telegraph.    But two other surveys, the MORI poll conducted for theSunday Times and the Harris poll published in the Observernewspaper, gave Labour a nine-point lead over the Alliance.    These polls showed 33 pct supported Labour against 26 pctfor the Alliance, a grouping of the Liberal Party and theSocial Democratic Party, while 39 pct backed the Conservatives.    The Gallup poll results are the latest in a series ofsetbacks for the Labour party, in disarray over its non-nuclearpolicy and plagued by internal feuding. REUTER&#3;
