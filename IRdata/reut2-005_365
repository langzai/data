A new method of calculating Sweden'sunemployment figures reduced the number of jobless by a sixth,a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB) said,reporting a substantial drop in the past year.    According to the revised data there were 94,000 jobless inFebruary representing 2.2 pct of the workforce against 120,000or 2.8 pct of the workforce in February 1986.    SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were basedon a more extensive survey of the unemployed which broughtSweden into line with the practises recommended by theGeneva-based International Labour Organisation.    Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployedby about 16 pct. "The way we are now collecting data is far moreaccurate and we are asking many more questions to find outwhether the jobless want work, whether they are able to workand whether they have actually looked for work," he toldReuters.    The new method was first used for the January figures,which showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforcefrom 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said thechange had apparently not been noticed by the press.    Recalculated according to the new method, unemployment inFebruary 1986 would have stood at 2.2 pct, the SCB said. REUTER&#3;
