ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc  hasabout 500 mln dlrs in cash and another 1.50 billion dlrs inavailable credit, which it intends to use to buy apharmaceutical company, Chairman Milan Panic said.    At the company's annual meeting, he said an acquisitioncould take place in the next 24 months.    "The company has nearly two billion dlrs available foracquisition today," Panic said, adding, "We are investigating anumber of companies." One company being studied could possiblybe acquired on a friendly basis, he said.    Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today torepurchase up to three mln ICN common shares.    Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic saidthe such a purchase is necessary because ICN's currentmarketing capability would not be sufficient to supportdistribution of the company's products, given ICN'sexpectations for market growth worldwide.    ICN's principal product is ribavirin, also known asVirazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries anddescribed as a broad-based anti-viral.    The company has said its possible applications includetreatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza,childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers.    ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention inrecent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinicaltrials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases.    Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regardto AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes itsreview of data submitted by the company.    He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by aHouse Subcommittee is continuing.    The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they areconducting separate investigations to determine whether or notICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.    Virazole is approved for marketing in the U.S. in aerosolform as a treatment for an infection that strikes infants,called respiratory syncytial virus. Reuter&#3;
