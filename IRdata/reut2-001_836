President Francesco Cossiga meets politicalleaders to discuss how to form a new government following theresignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi.    Craxi's Socialist Party has said it will not serve underForeign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been prime ministerfive times previously and whom the majority ChristianDemocratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again.    The Socialist Party, the second biggest in the outgoingfive-party coalition, said it would accept only Ciriaco DeMita, Christian Democratic Party secretary, or the party'spresident, Arnaldo Forlani, for the job of prime minister.    Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult andcould take several days due to rivalry between the two leadingparties. In Craxi's 3-1/2 years as prime minister, theChristian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at beingdenied the prime minister's job. The sources said early generalelections are likely unless agreement can be reached.    Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holdingtalks with party leaders, including the opposition Communistsand the junior coalition members -- Republicans, Liberals andSocial Democrats.  After the consultations, Cossiga will name aprime minister-designate who will try to form a government. REUTER&#3;
