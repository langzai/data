France today protested over Canada'sdecision to declare its ports off limits to French fishingvessels and bar further fishing by France off Newfoundland.    A foreign ministry statement described yesterday's decisionby Canada as "unjustified and contrary to international law andcommitments made by Canada," and called on Ottawa authorities toreexamin their position.    Accusing the French of overfishing, Canada yesterday saidthat any French fishermen caught in the Burgeo Bank area, offthe south coast of Newfoundland, would be arrested.    "The French government strongly protests against the closingof Canadian ports to French fishing vessels and against thefishing ban decided by canada on the Burgeo Bank," the ministrystatement added.    The French foreign ministry said the measure, the latestepisode in the long-running fishing dispute, would have anegative effect on fishing negotiations currently held betweenOttawa and Paris.    Canada is claiming the French have exceeded their6,400-tonne quota of cod allowed in the area.    In January Canada and France concluded an interim fishingaccord, opposed by fishermen in both countries, allowing Franceto increase its cod quota by about 15,000 tonnes during 1987.    Under this accord, Canada and France also agreed to referdifferences over a maritime boundary zone near the Frenchislands of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon to internationalarbitration. Reuter&#3;
