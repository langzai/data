The Chernobyl nuclear plant disasterhas left Soviet plans to extend nuclear power stationsunchanged, but will in the long run cause major problems forthe electricity industry, a Western expert said.    West German economics researcher Jochen Bethkenhagen, in areport presented to a NATO economics seminar, said increasedtargets for Soviet nuclear energy output showed the April,1986, disaster had not caused any change in Moscow's energypolicy.    But the accident was expected to prompt design changes infuture Soviet power stations to "exclude manipulations of safetyequipment" of the sort that occurred at Chernobyl, he said.    This will presumably result in substantial delays in thecompletion of reactor blocks and in stricter quality controlsduring the construction of nuclear power stations, he said.    Bethkenhagen said the Chernobyl accident was also likely tohave frustrated for a long time Soviet hopes of exports ofnuclear power stations to countries outside the Comecon bloc.    "It is also doubtful that the talks with China, Syria, Libyaand Iraq with regard to Soviet deliveries in the next few yearswill have positive results," he said.    The meeting heard views of academics and Kremlin-watcherson the impact of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on energypolicy.    Several participants today argued that Gorbachev wasunlikely to extend his internal economic policies to the energysector, at least for now.    Bethkenhagen said high energy growth targets set by theSoviet Union up to the end of the decade showed Moscow intendedto stick to a rigid supply-, rather than demand-orientedpolicy.    Norwegian academics Arild Moe and Helge Ole Bergesen saidthat the Soviet fuel industries represented such a pillar ofthe economy that immediate reform was tricky. "Any 'experiment'on a large scale cannot be allowed, because the negativeconsequences if a reform backfires will be too great," theysaid. REUTER&#3;
