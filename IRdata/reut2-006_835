Soybeans produced in the UnitedStates face a competitive price problem because of the loanrate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary ofAgriculture Daniel Amstutz said.    Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriationssubcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a "squeeze"because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rateswhile limiting the soybean reduction.    As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans "have a priceproblem" in competing with other soybean producing countries.    Amstutz called the situation a "dilemma" for the USDA, andsaid "we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilizationand Conservation Service) looking at this."    He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation. Reuter&#3;
