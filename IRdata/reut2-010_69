The U.S. General Accounting Officesaid generic commodities certificates cost the U.S. governmentin total Commodity Credit Corp outlays 107 mln to 653 mln dlrsmore than cash payments through February, 1987.    However, GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley, intestimony prepared for delivery to the Senate AgricultureCommittee, said short-term commodity storage cost savingsrelated to the use of payment-in-kind certificates could befrom about 169 mln 253 mln dlrs.    U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said theissuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates in fiscal years1986-88 could cost as much as 550 mln dlrs more than cashoutlays.    In his prepared remarks to the Senate panel, Amstutzstressed that USDA was "very pleased with the success of usingcommodity certificates" and looked forward to their continueduse.    He said the cost of using certificates must be weighedagainst immediate benefits, including greater market liquidity,improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income,improved debt situation and decreased carrying charges,especially pertaining to 1985 crop loans.    Crowley said future government storage costs would bereduced only if in the long run certificates led to a decreasein CCC-owned inventory.    "We believe that such a reduction, if it occurs, will notbe large," Crowley said.    Crowley also said that because certificate amounts are notincluded in the federal budget's outlay totals at the time ofissuance, they could "lessen the usefulness of the budget."    Crowley conceded that certificates help farmers avoidstorage costs, give them marketing flexibility and enhancefarmers' incomes.    He also said certificates have benefited the grain industryby giving it easier access to CCC-owned grain at market prices. Reuter&#3;
