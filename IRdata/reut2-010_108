International Cocoa Organization's,ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon continued work towards acompromise plan on how the ICCO buffer stock should buy cocoa,consumer delegates said.    Consumer delegates said Bra Kanon had not formallypresented the compromise plan to producers and consumers, andit was unlikely he would do so before Friday, they said.    There was widespread confidence a result on the outstandingitems could be reached by Friday, when the council session isdue to end, consumers said.    Bra Kanon completed bilateral consultations with severaldelegations today on the main sticking points in the draftbuffer stock rules package, they said.    Certain delegations wanted further discussion on the amountof non-member cocoa the buffer stock will be permitted to buy,differentials for different origin cocoas and limits on bufferstock purchases of nearby, and forward material, the delegatessaid.    The buffer stock working group finalized the remainingbuffer stock rules, with only minor modifications to theoriginal draft buffer stock package produced last week, thedelegates said.    The ICCO council is due to elect a new executive directorwhen it reconvenes Friday, producer delegates said.    Producers intend to present a single candidate for thepost, and this is most likely to be Edouard Kouame from IvoryCoast, they said.    Earlier, the existing executive director, Kobena Erbynnfrom Ghana, was expected to re-nominated, but he is now likelyto withdraw, the delegates said.    The executive committee is due to meet Friday at 1100 GMT,with the council unlikely to reconvene until late Friday,consumers said. Reuter&#3;
