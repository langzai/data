Finance Minister Michael Wilson unveileda wide-ranging reform of the personal tax system that includeslimiting the capital gains exemption and a sharp cut in thedividend tax credit.    With most changes effective at the first of next year,Wilson also announced he was cutting the number of tax bracketsfrom 10 to three.    He said the changes will cut personal tax revenues by twobillion dlrs in 1988 and by more than 11 billion dlrs over thenext five years.    "Most Canadians will pay lower taxes because of twofar-reaching changes. A new structure of federal income taxrates and the conversion of exemptions and deductions to taxcredits," Wilson told the House of Commons.    The new tax brackets will be 17 pct on the first 27,500dlrs of taxable income, 26 pct on the next 27,500 dlrs and 29pct on taxable income in excess of 55,000 dlrs. The maximum taxrate is 34 pct under the current system.    In a major reversal of his own initiative, Wilson said thecontroversial 500,000 dlrs capital gains exemption will bereduced to 100,000 dlrs over an investors' lifetime.    Wilson introduced the exemption shortly after taking officein 1984 as a a way of stimulating investment, but it wassharply criticized by the opposition as over-generous towealthy investors.    The 500,000 dlr lifetime exemption  will be kept on thesale of farm land and for small businesess, however.    Also, the taxable portion of a capital gain will increasefrom 50 pct currently to 66-2/3 pct in 1988 and 75 pct in 1990.    The dividend tax credit will be reduced from 33-1/3 pct to25 pct and the deduction for up to 1,000 dlrs of interest anddividend income will be eliminated in 1988.    Wilson said tax treatment for registered retirement savingsplan contributions will be maintained but the phase in of theincrease in the maximum limit to 15,500 dlrs will be delayed four years to 1994.
