&lt;Sulpetro Ltd> said it had notyet obtained Canadian government approval of a previouslyreported agreement to restructure its 505 mln dlr debt, andremaines dependent in the interim on support from its principalbanker.    Sulpetro said it was operating as if the restructuring wereimplemented, and was required to pay interest only on the termloan part of its debt.   It earlier said its net loss for the first quarter endedJanuary 31 fell to 9.9 mln dlrs from a restated year-earlierloss of 17.3 mln dlrs.    Sulpetro president Michael Williams declined to speculate,in reply to a query, on when government approval of therestructuring deal was likely.    The company said first quarter costs fell to 25.4 mln dlrsfrom year-ago 45.5 mln dlrs, due partly to lower sales costsand reduced depletion because of its fiscal 1986 writedown.    First quarter revenues fell to 14.7 mln dlrs fromyear-earlier 29.8 mln because of lower wellhead prices, reducedgas and natural gas liquids sales, disposal of its Britishproperties and surrender of part of the Irish-Lindbergh heavyoil properties, Sulpetro said.
