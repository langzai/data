Caesars World Inc said its boardunanimously rejected a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by NewYork investor Martin T. Sosnoff.    Caesars said Sosnoff's offer to by all its outstandingshares of common stock was inadequate and not in the bestinterests of its shareholders.    The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoff'soffer, made through his &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, and not tenderany of their shares.    Caesars said it will explore a variety of alternativetransactions but did not elaborate.    Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it wouldseek to buy back its shares held by Sosnoff.    A Caesars spokesman said the company would not commentfurther on its decision.    On Wednesday, Sosnoff told the Securities and ExchangeCommission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock.    Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered tobuyout his holdings several times during the past year.    No one from the Sosnoff organization was immediatelyavailable for comment.    Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham LambertInc, had determined that Sosnoff's offer was financiallyinadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff.    The company said other factors it considered in rejectingthe offer were its financial condition, future prospects,current market conditions and the numerous conditions on whichSosnoff's bid was conditioned.    Caesars' stock opened up 1/8 point at 28-1/8. That is 1/8point above Sosnoff's offer price. Reuter&#3;
