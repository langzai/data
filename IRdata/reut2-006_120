The International Cocoa Organization,ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draftproposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.    The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director KobenaErbynn, represented a compromise between producer, EuropeanCommunity, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stockshould operate, they said.    The proposal involved three key principles. First, thebuffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa ratherthan using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would befree to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa couldcomprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the thirdlaid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock managerwould pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to beset by a formula, the delegates said.    After the plan was presented, working group delegates metbriefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and allconsumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reactionto the scheme and will respond to it when the working groupmeets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base towork from, one consumer delegate said.    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point fornegotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change. Reuter&#3;
