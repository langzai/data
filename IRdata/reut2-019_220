Salomon Brothers Inc said it hasacquired 21,978 convertible subordinated debentures of HarcourtBrace Jovanovich Inc, which it says could be converted into21,978,000 common shares.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,the New York brokerage firm said it bought the debentures,which have a face value of 1,000 dlrs each, in May and June asa regular part of its investment and arbitrage activities.    The conversion rights of the debentures are the subject ofa Florida court case, in which Salomon Brothers said it hasalso intervened.    Salomon Brothers said it rejects Hartcourt's position thatthe debentures are not convertible into stock as of June 9.    It said it would leave open a range of options regardingthe debentures, including buying more, selling some or all oftheir current stake in the market or in negotiated deals,talking with other Harcourt security holders, surrendering thedebentures if there were a merger or tender offer or convertingthem into stock.    Salomon said it would have a 35.8 pct stake in Harcourt,based on 39.4 mln shares outstanding, if it converted thedebentures into 21,978,000 common shares. The percentage isbased on the current outstanding plus the amount of stock thatwould be issued in a conversion.    But Salomon said its stake in Harcourt's common stock wouldbe lower if other debentureholders converted their securitiesinto stock. It says it has no idea of the total number ofdebentures outstanding.    Harcourt has said that Salomon and Mutual Shares Corp, aNew York investment firm, hold a combined total of 30 mln dlrsof debentures.    Harcourt announced a recapitalization plan last month toward off a takeover attempt by British publisher RobertMaxwell.    Reuter&#3;
