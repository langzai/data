House Speaker Jim Wright predictedthe House would vote by a substantial margin to block 40 mlndlrs in aid to the Nicaraguan "contra" rebels until PresidentReagan has accounted for previous assistance.    Wright, a Texas Democrat, conceded Congress ultimately willbe unable to stop the money but said the House vote expectedlater today will tell the White House its contra program -- oneof Reagan's pet projects -- is in trouble.    "The adminstration must face reality and focus on other waysto find peace," Wright said.    The House is voting on legislation that would block for sixmonths 40 mln dlrs appropriated last year. The administrationhas said it intends to start using the money next month toprovide arms and equipment to the rebels.    "We expect to win by a substantial margin," Wright said.    The legislation calls on Reagan to account for all previousaid, including money diverted to the contras from the secretU.S. arms sales to Iran. The scandal over the arms sales andthe diversion of profits to the contras has plunged the Reaganadministration into its deepest crisis.    The legislation also demands an accounting of 27 mln dlr inhumanitarian aid appropriated by Congress in 1985 and all fundsgiven to the contras by foreign governments or privateindividuals at the urging of the Reagan administration.
