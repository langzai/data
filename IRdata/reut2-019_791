Canadian Tire Corp Ltd said it stillhopes a special board committee can solve a voting rightsdispute between class A and common stock shareholders.    "Although no such proposal has yet been developed, thedirectors hope that such a result can be achieved," chairmanHugh Macaulay said at the annual meeting.    The committee, formed last fall, has been trying todetermine the voting rights of class A non-voting shares ifcontrol of the company changes hands.       The Ontario Securities Commission blocked a 270 mln dlrtakeover bid last January for 49 pct of the company's commonshares.    The OSC said the bid by a group of Canadian Tire storeowners abused shareholders rights by circumventing shareprovisions that would convert non-voting stock into votingshares if more than 50 pct of the stock changed ownership.    Since then, three members of the Billes family, who agreedto tender their 60 pct holding of Canadian Tire's common sharesto the pro rata offer, have commenced legal proceedings amongstthemselves.    Macaulay said he would not comment further on the situation"while matters remain in an unsettled state".    At the meeting, president Dean Groussman said the higherprofit trend evident in the first quarter ended April 4 wascontinuing. First quarter net rose 10 pct to 21.1 mln dlrs from19.2 mln dlrs a year earlier.    Groussman also said the company plans sharply highercapital spending this year of 103 mln dlrs, compared to 43 mlndlrs last year, and it will likely maintain high levels ofcapital investment in 1988 and 1989.
