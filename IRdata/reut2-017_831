Nixdorf Computer AG&lt;NIXG.F> plans a sharp expansion of its activities in theUnited States, deputy management board chairman Arno Bohn said.    He told a news conference that in the medium term Nixdorfwanted to raise its U.S. Turnover to one billion marks from acurrent 300 mln and aimed to employ some 5,000 people in itsU.S. Operations, compared with 1,300 now.    Nixdorf's world group turnover was 4.50 billion marks in1986. Bohn said a major order last year from a U.S. Retailerwas a decisive element behind current plans for expansion.    Retail chain Montgomery Ward and Co Inc, a unit of MobilCorp &lt;MOB>, awarded a 100 mln dlr order to Nixdorf in July lastyear for point-of-sales computer terminals.    Bohn said that by 1990 there should be a total 15,000 cashterminals and 500 computer terminals in place in all of the 290stores of Montgomery Ward.    Nixdorf has said previously that, more important than thesupply of the hardware for these systems, is the fact thatNixdorf is also providing the relevant software. REUTER&#3;
