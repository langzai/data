The Philippines and its bank advisorycommittee completed another round of debt rescheduling talks and will meet again on Saturday, a senior banker said.    Although today's negotiations did not produce a finalagreement, the decision to meet at the weekend appears to be asignal that the two sides are making progress.    The Philippines seeks to restructure 9.4 billion dlr of its27.2 billion dlr foreign debt. The interest rate to be chargedon the debt and Manila's proposal to pay interest partly withinvestment notes instead of cash have been the main stickingpoints in the talks. Reuter&#3;
