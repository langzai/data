Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said heexpects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.    "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told theSenate Energy Committee.    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production throughthe shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wellsbecause of low prices was probably permanent. He said he wasalso concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He saidgeologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discoveryof oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay. Reuter&#3;
