Exchanges and telecommunicationsauthorities should abolish their restrictions on full and freedissemination of information to the investment and bankingcommunities, Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L> chairman SirChristopher Hogg said.    In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiationshad brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchangesfor fuller, but still not complete, access to market datathrough Reuter services.    "Many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.    Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe thatinformation restrictions protected their interests.    In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting thedistribution of data in order to provide competitive advantageto their own commercial information businesses.    He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in thetelecommunications field, some countries continue to protecttheir state monopolies at the expense of other economicsectors.    "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from suchcountries. As a result, banking communities serving entireeconomies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.    Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct fromthe previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenuesto 620.9 mln stg.    Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.
