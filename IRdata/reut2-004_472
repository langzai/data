Allied-Lyons PLC &lt;ALLD.L> and Canada'sReichmann brothers are working well together as partners andcurrently do not plan any change in their joint ownership ofdistiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyonschairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.    Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderhamlast year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'&lt;Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pactafter a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of&lt;Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>.    "We are getting along very well as partners ... I hopethere won't be any change, but there could be," Holden-Browntold reporters after a speech in Toronto.    He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that couldforce Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, andGulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligateAllied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.    "Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasionfor either the put or call to be exercised," Holden-Brown said.    In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said itwould be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. "I don'tthink we would have any objection to it," he added.    Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham'sboard of directors and has total responsibility for itsmanagement. "We cannot contemplate giving up our control," hesaid.    Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profitcontribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financialresults, but he said "it will be substantial."    "I am not able to give profit forecasts," he said.    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance theHiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,and has no current plans for a stock issue.    He said the company is not currently negotiating any moreacquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluatingpossible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or foodconcerns. "I don't think we shall be looking at the breweryscene (which is) highly concentrated already," he added.    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares onCanadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.              Reuter&#3;
