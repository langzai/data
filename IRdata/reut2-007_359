Council of Economic AdvisersChairman Beryl Sprinkel called on Latin American governments toadopt sounder economic policies and said U.S. banks' loans tothose countries had already been written down in an economicsense.    "Latin governments will have to adopt policies that promotegrowth for their own citizens," he said, adding that the recordhas been mixed.    Brazil, he said, recently has backtracked from bettereconomic policies and "obviously they have to change."    Asked if U.S. banks ultimately would be forced to writedown portions of their loans to Latin America, Sprinkel said,"In any realistic sense, economic sense, those loans have beenwritten down."    The banks could not sell the loans at par, he said, and theprice/earnings ratio of major banks' stocks has not been doingvery well.    "Clearly the lenders have suffered," said Sprinkel. Reuter&#3;
