A cold air mass working its waysouth from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard redwinter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheatspecialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.    "There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough alongso that it's probably vulnerable," Krenzler said.    Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air movingfrom the north could put temperatures in the middle 20'sfahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of alow pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall thesystem.    If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hitOklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperaturescould stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.    Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crophas advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the morevulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.    "We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26degrees (fahrenheit)," Krenzler said, "as long as we don't havea lot of wind."    "If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say wehave a good chance of significant damage to the heads," hesaid.    Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central andsouthwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developedand have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.
