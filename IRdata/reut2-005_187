Australia faces the risk of recession ifcapital expenditure does not grow from the subdued levels ofrecent years, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said.    "Without stronger levels of capital expenditure, thestructural adjustment that is so critical to overcoming theeconomy's fundamental problems cannot occur," the bank said itslatest Economic Newsletter.    "In that event, Australia would be destined to experience aprolonged period of sub-par growth at best, with the very realrisk that the onset of serious recession would becomeunavoidable," it said.    Australia's medium-term economic performance will befundamentally determined by business investment in the periodimmediately ahead, the bank said.    It said spending has been disappointing in recent years dueto low capacity utilisation, low expected profitability andvery high real interest rates.    There also appears to be little likelihood of anysignificant improvement for the present, it said.    Investment is strongly influenced by medium-termuncertainties and risks and these are likely to continue forthe present, it said. REUTER&#3;
