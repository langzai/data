Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officialswere not available for comment on market rumors that it isinterested in acquiring Reed International plc &lt;REED.L>.    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financialadviser, declined comment.    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, saidthe rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt hasannounced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeoverattempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell."It's completelyinconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if theydrop the recapitalization," he said.    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of aU.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought adeclaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011in light of the recapitalization.    Harcourt said in a statement this week that SalomonBrothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in thecase, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amountof the debenture. In addition, British Printing andCommunications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs faceamount, Harcourt said.    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If thecourt decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is notrequired to issue common to debenture holders who did notconvert prior to June eight.    An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributedby brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumorsthat Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in NewYork said "there's no basis to think that it's us." Reuter&#3;
