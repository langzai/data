Union Carbide Corp is looking toacquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals andplastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president ofChemicals and Plastics.    Describing this as a major departure in the company'sapproach to commercial development, he told the annual newbusiness forum of the Commercial Development Association "Weare looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they looklike the fastest and most promising routes to the growthmarkets we've identified."    Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that ifwe couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if itwas worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenbergerexplained.    He said "there are times when exploiting a profitablemarket is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need toplow resources into a technology we may not have if we can linkup profitably with someone who is already there."    He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that wayand is now extending its specialty chemicals business in thesame way. Reuter&#3;
