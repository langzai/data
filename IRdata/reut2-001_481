The EC Executive Commission has backeda plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasolinein a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.    It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow ECstates to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing leadat six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by ECministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban."It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said.    But the Commission said imposing the ban would encouragethe use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gasstations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had tostock. Reuter&#3;
