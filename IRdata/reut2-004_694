The Finnish metal and mining groupOutokumpu Oy said it will close its nickel refinery atHarjavalta in central Finland for six weeks in July and Augustthis year due to current low prices on the nickel market.    "We consider nickel prices as bad at the moment, althoughthey have been rising slightly since January," refinery salesmanager Pekka Purra said.    He said the closure will mean a drop in production of 3,000tonnes in 1987 from last year's output of 17,800 tonnes. Theclosure was also a move to cut labour costs as no extra staffhave to be employed during holidays to keep the plant open. Reuter&#3;
