Directors of the Chicago Board ofTrade, CBT, decided at their regular board meeting lateyesterday to submit a long-term Japanese Government Bondfutures conrtact to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,CFTC, for approval.    The CBT's action was made possible by a ruling last week bythe Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, which removed akey regulartory obstacle to trading futures on foreign debtsecurities on U.S. exchanges.    The CBT originally had approved a yen bond futures contractin December 1986 but the SEC rule precluded the application.    The application to the CFTC could be made as soon as earlynext week, but the SEC's rule change must first be formalizedby its publication in the federal register, an CBT spokesmansaid.    The exchange said it did not know when the yen bond futurescontract would be approved the the CFTC, but that CFTCprovisions require that new contract submissions be acted uponwithin one year after submission.
