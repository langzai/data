Officials and diplomats said EC farmministers, who earlier this week ended another marathonnegotiating session, achieved more than ever before in thefight to end food surpluses, and delighted EC officials are nowpreparing to carry the reform offensive into other areas.    Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil"lakes" and level the "grain mountain" that have brought theCommunity so much unwelcome publicity.    Earlier this week, ministers finally agreed after 36 hoursof negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cutmilk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks,now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes.    Officials said new rules, which place strict limits onfarmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices, couldbe expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle andpave the way for reform in other surplus sectors.    The deal was reached despite determined attempts atbacksliding by some states as the implications of the originaloutline accord reached last December began to sink in.    "Despite coming under tremendous pressure, the ministersnever wavered from the main features of the deal," one seniorofficial said, adding the result augured well for talks laterthis month on other reforms.    The Commission is leading the fight against food surplusesand has now proposed the most severe annual price review, atwhich ministers fix farm support prices, in the EC's history.    Most prices would be cut or frozen, new quality standardsenforced, and most farmers' rights to sell to interventioncurtailed. Officials say the measures could lead to effectiveprice cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct.    EC Commissioner Frans Andriessen is currently working onproposals to provide direct income aids to farmers to cushionthem from the worst effects of a restrictive price policy andencourage ministers to swallow the reform pill.
