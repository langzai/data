The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchangehas expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee "C"contracts to 6.0 cents a lb, from the previous 4.0 cents,effective today, the CSCE said.    The new daily limits apply to all but the two nearbypositions, currently May and July, which trade without limits.    In addition, the 6.0 cent limit can be increased to 9.0cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limitmoves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions,according to the CSCE announcement.    Before the rule change today, the CSCE required two days oflimit moves in the first three restricted contracts beforeexpanding the daily trading limit.    Under new guidelines, if the first two restricteddeliveries move the 6.0 cent limit for two days the Exchangewill expand the limit. The expanded 9.0 cent limit will remainin effect until the settling prices on both of the first twolimited months has not moved by more than the normal 6.0 centlimit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions,the CSCE said.
