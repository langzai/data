Moody's Investors Service Inc said itcut to B-2 from Ba-1 Diamond Bathurst Inc's subordinated notesof 1995.    Moody's said it expects the company's operating performancewould be hurt by heightened competition and by the increasinginroads being made by other forms of packaging.    It said Diamond should benefit from production efficiency,quality control and plant closings. But due to the company'smajor role in selling to the distilled spirits industry, one ofthe smaller markets for glass containers, its margins and assetreturns may not materially improve, Moody's said.
