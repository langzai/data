The Finance Ministry is trying toeliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases ofJapanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and centralbanks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, asenior Finance Ministry official said.    The official declined to give details but securitiessources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-billsto be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buybills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims istime consuming, they said.    Securities houses here have had difficulty sellingsix-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseasgovernments and central banks because of the tax system and theBank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accountsbe kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as akey short-term instrument to promote internationalization ofthe yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entrysystem for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governmentsand central banks have shied away from buying the bills, thesources said.    Foreign governments and central banks are thereforeexpected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank ofJapan, the securities sources said.    Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the nextU.S.-Japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation ofTokyo's financial market, expected in May, they said. REUTER&#3;
