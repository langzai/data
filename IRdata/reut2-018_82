A former U.S. Agriculture Departmentofficial urged the department to require that packages ofchicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions toprotect the public from disease.    Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriemand a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food andconsumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, "everyhour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chickencontaminated with salmonella."    She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies ofsalmonellosis or complications arising from it and theincidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily overthe past several years.    Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy ofSciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remindconsumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness.    She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughlybefore they are defeathered and that defeathering machines becleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if theirintestines are punctured or there is visible fecalcontamination and that chiller water be changed more often.    Kenneth Blaylock, President of the American Federation ofGovernment Employees, said a poultry industry recommendation tomove away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove"disastrous." He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection withslower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspectiontechniques should be overlaid. Reuter&#3;
