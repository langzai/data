Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullahbin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for hiscountry's close, and closed-mouthed, cooperation withWashington in the Gulf, a senior U.S. official said.    "The Saudis are being very cooperative. It would be nice ifthe Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,"said the official who asked not to be named.    He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis wereproviding, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant toacknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States hasstationed forces to protect shipping lanes.

The senior U.S. official said his remark was an endorsementof the U.S. attack. Reuter&#3;
