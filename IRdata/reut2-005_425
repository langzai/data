U.S. Based speciality food retailer &lt;MrsFields Inc>, which earlier announced pre-tax profits of 17.1mln dlrs in 1986 against 6.8 mln in 1985, said it plans furthergrowth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the U.S.    The company, which is quoted on London's UnlistedSecurities Market (USM), said it also planned to expand itsoutlets internationally.    However, chairman Randall Fields told a news conference thecompany would not move into any new countries during 1987 butwould intensify its efforts where it already had stores.    During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores, including 76in the U.S., Two in Australia and one each in Japan, Canada andthe U.K.    "We intend to open a minimum of five more units in Londonfor example and it is reasonable that we might open otherstores in other European countries in 1988," Fields said.    He said the company acquired competitive businesses as amatter of routine, and might add others in 1987, but declinedto say how much the company planned to spend on them.    Last year turnover rose by 20.8 pct to 87.1 mln dlrs from72.6 mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter&#3;
