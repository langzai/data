A U.S. Commerce Department spokesmansaid the agency would have no comment on Schlumberger Ltd'sannouncement that it had terminated an agreement in principleto sell its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp unit to Fujitsu Ltd.    Sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding theventure made it unlikely the sale could be completed any timesoon. The sale was opposed by Commerce and the U.S. DefenseDepartment, in part on national security grounds.    Commerce chief spokesman B.J. Cooper said the departmenthad had no contact with Schlumberger about the deal.    A Defense Department spokesman said the agency was unawareof Schlumberger's announcement and would have no immediatereaction.    Officials last week told Reuters that Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger hadjoined forces to fight the planned sale because it could haveleft the U.S. military overly dependent on foreign sources forvital equipment used in high-technology weapons.    Administration opposition to the deal also stemmed fromongoing trade tensions between the United States and Japan,officials said. Reuter&#3;
