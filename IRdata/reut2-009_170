China should tighten imports of ordinarygoods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can bemade domestically, Premier Zhao Ziyang said.    He told the National People's Congress, China's parliament,that the country's foreign exchange is limited and must be usedwhere it is most needed.    "We should expand production of import substitutes andincrease their proportion," he said.    On exports, China should increase its proportion ofmanufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrialgoods, electronics and machinery, he said.    Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports andcontrol the export of goods that incur too much loss. In 1986China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs, down from arecord 14 billion in 1985.    Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourableinvestment environment for foreign businessmen. It should useforeign funds for production and construction, with stress onfirms making goods for export or import substitutes.    China should also earn more foreign exchange from touristsand contracted labour abroad, he added. REUTER&#3;
