The House Banking Committee approvedlegislation to bar foreign securities firms from designation asprimary dealers in U.S. government securities unless therelevant foreign government allows U.S. securities firms thesame trading rights.    The impact of the proposed legislation would be on threeJapanese securities firms already doing business in the U.S.,an aide to the sponsor of the provision Rep. Charles Schumersaid. Japan would have six months to open its governmentsecurities markets to U.S. firms before the ban would start.Other foreign firms would meet the test of reciprocal access.    The legislation was approved as part of a major trade bill,which the House will consider next month. The bill also has tobe considered by the Senate and signed by the president.    The three Japanese firms are Nomura Securities Co. andDaiwa Securities Co., which received approval from the U.S.Federal Reserve Board to serve as primary dealers, and AubreyG. Lanston Co., owned by the Industrial Bank of Japan.    Schumer, a New York Democrat, said the Fed would not beallowed to designate any new firms as primary dealers unlesstheir government allows reciprocal access to U.S. companies.Both the House and Senate Banking Committees opposed the Fedaction on the two Japanese firms.
