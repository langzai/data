The House Armed Services Committeeslashed President Reagan's funding request for the StrategicDefense Initiative (SDI), approving 1.7 billion dlrs less thanhe had proposed for the anti-missile program.    The committee, during its consideration of the 1988 defenseauthorization bill, also cut by more than half Reagan's requestfor a rail system for strategic missiles.    The proposals must be adopted by the full House and Senatebefore becoming law.    The committee approved 3.5 billion dlrs for SDI, a land-and space-based anti-missile defense program commonly known as"Star Wars." The amount was 1.7 billion dlrs less than theadministration request of 5.2 billion dlrs.    The Reagan administration has requested a total of 312billion dlrs for defense in 1988, but congressional leadershave said that will be cut as part of a budget-trimming effortto reduce the huge federal deficit.    In other action today, the committee approved 250 mln dlrsfor a rail system for inter-continental ballistic missiles, butdid not specify which missile system. Supporters have saidmissiles on such a rail network would be less vulernable toattack than those in fixed underground silos.    The administration requested 590 mln dlrs specifically fora rail-mobile system for the 10-warhead MX missile. But manycongressmen, including House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin,a Wisconsin Democrat, favor a smaller mobile missile dubbed the"Midgetman." Reuter&#3;
