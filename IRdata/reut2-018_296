Amoco Corp's wholly owned AmocoCanada Petroleum Co Ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion-Canadian-dlr acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd will benefitCanada just like the foreign investment that made possiblecommercial development of Alberta's oilsands.    Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsandsconference that "Amoco Canada has presented the solution to theDome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars anddetermination to make that solution work."    The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadiannationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome.    Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported shareoffer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership ofthe country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.    He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs ofDome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest inAmoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for fiveyears after the acquisition. Reuter&#3;
