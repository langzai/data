Angola's U.S.-backed UNITA rebelgroup has offered to reopen the Benguela railroad that runsthrough UNITA-held territory and links landlocked Zaire andZambia to the Angolan port of Lobito.    UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, in a statement made in hisJamba headquarters in southern Angola and released by UNITA's Washington office, said he was prepared to guarantee safepassage for non-military freight as a gesture of "peace andreconciliation."    Savimbi challenged the Cuban-backed Angolan government,which controls the port, to match his offer and allow goods topass through. There was no immediate response from Luanda.    UNITA has been fighting the Cuban-backed Angolan governmentsince 1976.    The offer of a rail route to the Atlantic would help SouthAfrica's black neighbors reduce their economic dependence onSouth Africa.    The U.S. Congress is currently considering a proposal tospend some 500 mln dlrs to build another railroad to help thesestates become less dependent on South Africa.    The Beira corridor runs through Mozambique to Tanzania'sIndian ocean ports but Savimbi suggested the Benguela route asan alternative.    "The Benguela route can safely open immediately," he said. "Itwill provide the transportation our neighbors need, and it willnot cost the Americans the money they say it will cost to openthe Beira corridor." Reuter&#3;
