China's application to join the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case bythe Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, atop European Community official said.    Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of theEuropean Communities, told a news conference that China'sapplication would involve long and difficult negotiations.    China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and inFebruary presented a memorandum backing its application, whichDe Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then bepresented to China.    "After China, other important state-trading countriesincluding the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.China's application could be considered a test case," he said.    He said the EC strongly backed China's application, butothers among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.    Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economyentering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity andthe expectation that China will practice an open-trade policywithout trade discrimination, de Clercq added.    De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chineseeconomy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two currentSocialist GATT members.    On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchangeshortage would force China to import less this year and nextthan in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipmentand capital.    During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders andtoday signed an agreement to open a European CommunityCommission office in Peking. REUTER&#3;
