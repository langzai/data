Biogen Inc said the EuropeanPatent Office granted it a patent covering certain proteinsused to produce a hepatitis B vaccine through geneticengineering techniques.    Robert Gottlieb, Biogen spokesman, said the company haslicensed the vaccine on a nonexclusive basis to &lt;Wellcome PLC>,the British pharmaceutical firm, and is discussing licensingwith other companies.    Biogen said the patent gives it the right to exclude othersfrom marketing hepatitis B vaccine in the 11 member countriesof the European Patent Convention.    Gottlieb said the company has also filed a patent in othermarkets, including the U.S. The vaccine is in clinical tests.    Patents in the biotechnology field are particularlyimportant as the company with an exclusive patent can reaplarge rewards. Recently many of the products of geneticengineering have become the target of patent lawsuits.    Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK> already sells a geneticallyengineered hepatitis B vaccine in the U.S. called RecombivaxHB. A subsidiary of &lt;SmithKline Beckman Corp>, SmithKlineBiologicals, based in Belgium, is selling a hepatitis Bvaccine, called Engerix-B, in Belgium.    A SmithKline spokesman said the vaccine has also beenformally approved in Switzerland and Luxembourg and has beenauthorized for market in a number of Far East countries.    Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection common in manyparts of Africa and southeast Asia where about five pct to 15pct of the population carry the virus. In the U.S. about200,000 new cases occur each year.    Last December the European Patent Ofice rejected Biogen'spatent for alpha-interferon, which Biogen said it will appealonce it receives a formal written opinion from the office.    Reuter&#3;
