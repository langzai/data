The New York Mercantile Exchange,NYMEX, has adequate trade practice surveillance anddisciplinary programs, but could take steps to improve them,the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, said.    In a rule enforcement review, CFTC said NYMEX was able toidentify possible "violative market activity" and thatinvestigations were generally thorough.    However, the commission faulted the exchange for limitingaccess to its computer-assisted trade practice surveillancesystem and recommended NYMEX enhance its computerizedsurveillance system.    CFTC also found NYMEX had an adequate disciplinary program,but noted that the disciplinary process sometimes was delayedbecause of failure to promptly schedule hearings. Reuter&#3;
