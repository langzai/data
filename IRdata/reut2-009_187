The Bank of Thailand is seeking FinanceMinistry approval to issue its first bond, central bank sourcessaid.    The planned three billion baht issue would carry a term ofsix months to one year as a short term move to mop up surplusfunds held by commercial banks.    The issue would offer a coupon attractive to commercialbanks, which currently have an estimated 30 to 60 billion bahtin funds invested in low-yield securities, the sources said.    The central bank, charged with supervision of commercialbanks, has previously issued only Finance Ministry bonds.    Private bankers said they are awaiting a central bankdecision on whether to allow commercial banks to continueholding up to 40 pct of their capital in foreign exchange or toreturn it to 20 pct as scheduled.    The six month 40 pct ceiling expires April 6 but the bankswant it extended for six more months.    They said a forced cut in foreign exchange positions wouldworsen the local liquidity problem as commercial banks wouldhave to convert about five billion baht worth of foreigncurrencies in their portfolios into baht.    Senior central bank officials suggested to reporters lastweek that the foreign exchange ceiling will be lowered todiscourage banks' use of excess funds for currency speculation.    Central bank sources said some commercial banks,anticipating such a central bank decision, have been convertingtheir foreign currencies into baht this week and lending theadditional funds to the Bank of Thailand's short-term loanrepurchase facility.    They said the Bank of Thailand's repurchase windowyesterday received offers of about three billion baht ofinvestment funds from commercial banks, three times its normaldaily amount.    The repurchase window uses government bonds as aninstrument with which commercial banks can borrow from or lendto the state bank.    The facility is sometimes used by the central bank to set alocal short-term interest benchmark through fixing its bondrepurchase rates. REUTER&#3;
