The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senatesided with President Reagan and defeated an attempt to cut U.S.aid to Mexico as a protest it is failing to cooperate fullywith the American war against drugs.    A day after the Senate trounced Reagan's attempt to sustaina veto of a major highway bill, a bipartisan majority gave hima victory by shelving on a 49 to 38 vote a measure to halveassistance given Mexico.    Two companion measures also were expected to be defeated,to halve aid to Panama and the Bahamas.    The fight was considered more symbolic than havingsignificant impact, since Mexico this year is receiving arelatively small 15.7 mln dlrs in assistance. But critics saidcutting the aid would hurt U.S.-Mexico relations. Reuter&#3;
