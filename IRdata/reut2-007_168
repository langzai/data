William Bradt, new chairman of the NewYork Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX, said his priorities are tomerge the exchange with other futures exchanges at the WorldTrade Center and to reallocate space on the crowded NYMEXfloor.    Bradt, a local trader and member of the board of governors,assumed his duties yesterday and met reporters.    "If all four exchanges become one, we would save incrediblecosts and become more competitive to Chicago," Bradt toldReuters.    Bradt was referring to a merger among the four exchanges atthe Commodity Exchange Center, an idea that has been discussedintermittently for several years.    The four exchanges -- the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee,Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and the New York Cotton Exchange inaddition to the NYMEX -- are all located on a single floor atthe World Trade Center.    Bradt said he would address the problem of space shortageson the exchange floor by reallocating booth space among themembers, including sharing of booths.    "If you are a company with potential business for the Merc,you should get a booth," he said, adding that an exchangecommittee is studying the problem.    The election of Bradt, and of local trader Vincent Viola asan at-large member, increases representation of locals on the15 member board to five members from four, according to a NYMEXspokesman.    Bradt defeated vice chairman Stanley Meierfeld by a vote of315 to 217. He will serve a two-year term and succeeds MichelMarks, who decided not to seek reelection after serving aschairman since 1978.    Zoltan Guttman was elected vice chairman and Thomas McMahonwas elected as trade house representative.
