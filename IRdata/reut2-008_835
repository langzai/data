A top official of a majorassociation of blood banks said Americans' fears of getting AIDS from tainted blood transfusions were greatly exaggerated.    "The (blood banking) system is strong," Edwin Steane,president of the American Association of Blood Banks, said at anews briefing here. "The current fears about AIDS transmissionare largely unfounded."    Steane made his remarks after the group found in a publicopinion poll that 55 pct of Americans believed it likely thatone could contract AIDS from a tainted blood transfusion.    The poll, conducted in December, was made public today.    A year earlier, in a similar survey, 53 pct of Americanssaid it was likely that one could contract AIDS from a bloodtransfusion, the group reported.    Steane said the practice of testing donated blood for thepresence of AIDS antibodies, begun in mid-1985, had virtuallyeliminated AIDS-infected blood from the U.S. supply system.    He said the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) hadreported only two cases of tainted blood being transfused sincethe testing program began. Reuter&#3;
