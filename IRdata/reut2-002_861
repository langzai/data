Malaysia's central bank said itacquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing &lt;United Asian Bank Bhd>(UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, torebuild public confidence in it.    UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following anaccumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the centralbank, Bank Negara, said in a statement.    But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up byshareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and theIndian Government.    Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribedshares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of228.74 mln ringgit.    It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.    The central bank early this week also announced that it hadbought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank,&lt;Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd>, after the latter raised itscapital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year.    Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to theshares of the two banks.    "The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including therecamp of management in these banks are some of the measurestaken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in thestability of the these banks," it added.    The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of theBanking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to anailing bank or to buy a stake in it. REUTER&#3;
