Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal saidTurkey and Greece were moving towards talks in their row overoil rights in the Aegean Sea.    He was speaking to reporters after talks with TurkishAmbassador to Athens Nazmi Akiman, who arrived last night froma meeting with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou.    "Both sides are now moving towards starting discussions. Inorder not to jeopardise these, it would be improper to givedetails," he said.    Ozal told reporters Akiman came to Turkey to brief thegovernment "on efforts aimed at starting discussions betweenTurkey and Greece" and a reply would be made to Athens soon.    He did not say whether he was taking up Papandreou'srenewed offer today that the two countries meet to discuss howto refer the issue to the International Court of Justice at TheHague, but said the court was not the only way to a solution.    Turkey has in the past rejected the basis for Greece'sproposal to go to the court, a 1956 Geneva Convention and theLaw of the Sea, which it says support Athens' arguments. REUTER&#3;
