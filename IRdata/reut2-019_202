Finance Minister Mark Eyskens isproposing a package of personal income tax cuts worth 102.1billion francs that would apply from 1989, a finance ministryspokesman said.    The package, one of 11 possible tax reform scenarios drawnup by government officials, is expected to be discussed byministers in the coming weeks so that a government draft can bepresented to parliament in October.    The proposals, which would greatly simplify the country'stax system, include a cut in withholding tax on investmentincome earned in Belgium to 20 pct from the current 25 pct.    The reduction would apply to income from risk capital, butthe spokesman said this was likely to be defined to include allshares and bonds.    The package chosen by Eyskens is more favourable tofamilies with children than the present regime and would treatspouses' incomes separately instead of combining them, apractice that is widely seen as discouraging marriage. The taxreform does not encompass corporate taxation.    The spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the packagewould be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowancescurrently granted to diverse interest groups.    A further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenuesresulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of thepackage.    This would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs,which the government would have to decide how to cover, eitherby raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts.    The package favoured by Eyskens, who has described Belgiumas a "fiscal Himalaya," is the least costly of the 11 scenariosprepared. It envisages three marginal rates, or tax thresholds,of 30 pct, 40 pct and 50 pct. This compares with 13 currently,of which the highest is 71.6 pct. REUTER&#3;
