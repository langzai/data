A 3.6 billion dlr plan to rid theEuropean Community (EC) of one mln tonnes of surplus butter isin doubt as Spain and Portugal refuse to drop their oppositionto the scheme, diplomats said.    The plan, proposed by the Community's executive Commission,aims to level most of the EC's huge and costly butter mountainby disposing of a total of 1.04 mln tonnes this year and next.    But the officials said Spain and Portugal, which joined the12-nation bloc at the beginning of last year, continued tooppose the scheme at a meeting of EC finance ministers here.    They argued they should not have to pay for the disposal ofsurpluses created before they became EC members.    The plan, already approved by farm ministers despiteopposition from Madrid and Lisbon, had been sent to financeministers for final approval.    But the diplomats said the finance ministers insteadreferred it back to the Commission, asking it to study possibleways to solve the row as soon as possible.    They said Spain and Portugal indicated they may go to theEuropean Court of Justice over the issue if the Commission didnot come up with a satisfactory solution.    The scheme has also run into criticism from the EC'sfinancial watchdog, the Court of Auditors.    The Court has said the plan is unsound because theCommission wants member states to foot the bill until it startsreimbursing them in four annual instalments from 1989.    Diplomats said Spain and Portugal backed the court's viewand also complained that, under complex financial agreementsworked out when they joined the EC, they would get less backlater than if they were reimbursed now.    Commission sources said it appeared the two countries wereholding out in a bid to squeeze some form of compensation outof their partners but it was unclear how much longer they wouldcontinue to block the scheme.
