A number of individual zinc producingcompanies have approached the European Commission to sound outits reaction to a possible industry plan for a voluntaryreduction of smelting capacity, Commission sources said.    The companies have been told that the Commission could notjudge whether a plan would be acceptable under EuropeanCommunity, EC, competition rules until it had full details,they said.    In 1983, the industry drew up a plan envisaging the loss ofabout 130,000 tonnes of annual capacity, or about 10 pct of thetotal.    However, the industry did not proceed with this plan aszinc market conditions improved in 1984, the sources noted.    They said the companies which approached the Commissionrecently -- and which they did not name -- appeared to envisagea loss of productive capacity similar to that proposed in 1983. Reuter&#3;
