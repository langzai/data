A Chinese leader said the country'sforeign debt was rising but the level was not dangerous andChina valued its good credit rating in the world.    Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun told a news conference for foreignjournalists the debt, including foreign investment, was 20.6billion dlrs at end-1986, of which 7.6 billion were inlong-term, low-interest loans.    "Considering the national economic strength of China and thescale of its imports and exports, this level of foreign debtcan be sustained by China now and has not developed to adangerous point," he said.    Finance Minister Wang Bingqian said in the budget speech onThursday that foreign borrowings in 1987 would be almost doublethe 1986 level and nearly six times the 1985 amount.    Under Chairman Mao Tse-tung's rule from 1949-1976, Chinaborrowed very little abroad, insisting that nearly alldevelopment be financed from the country's own resources.    Tian took the opposite view. "It is not enough for us torely totally on our own funds and capital (to achieve itsmodernisation). We have to have the courageous spirit to borrowa certain amount of foreign loans," he said.    He said China must not borrow too much and no more than itcan repay. "China has good credit in terms of foreign borrowingand we value this good credit," he said.    Vice Premier Yao Yilin, a former Commerce Minister, toldthe same news conference some people said China's foreign debtwas already too much and others said China could increase theamount.    "They proceed from their own perspectives to make suchremarks. We must always be clear-headed when we analyse thesituation," he said. REUTER&#3;
