U.S.-based Northwest Airlines, a unit ofNWA Inc &lt;NWA>, has ordered up to 20 of the European AirbusIndustrie &lt;AINP.PA> consortium's planned A340 long-range jets,with an option on a further 10 A330 medium-range jets, in adeal worth more than 2.5 billion dlrs, Airbus said in astatement.    The contract gives Airbus its first launch customer in thelucrative U.S. Market for its long-range jet programme.    Last month Airbus announced it had a total of 104commitments from nine customers for the planes. A spokeswomanconfirmed today's order was in addition to those commitments.    Airbus has been competing with McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD>in the long-range jet market since the U.S. Group formallylaunched its MD-11 plane program at the end of 1986. McDonnellDouglas has won over 100 orders and options for the aircraft.    The Northwest order comes after the airline ordered 10short-range A320 Airbus jets, with options on a further 90,last October, giving Airbus a foothold in the U.S. Market.    European governments, asked to fund 2.5 to three billiondlrs of the Airbus A330/340 programs, have said there may notbe room in the world aircraft market for Airbus's jets. Reuter&#3;
