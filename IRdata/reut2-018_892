A White House associate personneldirector, Mark Sullivan, emerged as a possible candidate toreplace Susan Phillips as chairman of the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission (CFTC).    Commodity industry and government sources said Sullivan,who is not well known to the commodities industry, has emergedthis week as a surprise candidate for the post.    Sullivan, an attorney, has been in charge of Reaganadministration personnel appointments in the legal andfinancial affairs areas since July, 1986.    Phillips resigned last month to assume the post of vicepresident of finance at the University of Iowa.    Following Phillips' resignation CFTC commissioner KaloHineman, a Kansas farmer, or commissioner Robert Davis wereconsidered the strongest candidates to head the agency, atleast temporarily.    However, industry sources said the strong speculation aboutSullivan suggests he now is the leading candidate.    Sullivan's name has also been floated recently for otherReagan administration financial regulatory positions. He wasrumored in April to be under consideration for a position onthe board of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulatesSavings and Loan Associations. Reuter&#3;
