Poland's communist government raisedfood, fuel and energy prices but said it had taken an economicrisk by reducing the scale of the increases under pressure fromthe country's official trade unions.    A communique broadcast on Saturday evening said food priceswould rise on average by 9.3 pct, petrol, gas and electricityby 25 pct and coal by 50 pct.    The immediate increases will be followed by a rise of 10pct in the cost of meat from April 1. Some postal charges willgo up 100 pct next month and rail and bus fares by 30 pct inOctober.    The government said its annual plan for the economy hadspecified a 13 pct increase in food prices this year.    "Economic reasoning calls for greater price rises than thosewhich have been announced ... The government has taken aneconomic risk in accepting a portion of the trades unions'demands," the communique said.    The National Trade Union Alliance (OPZZ), which claimsseven million members, warned earlier this month it would fightefforts to impose the original range of price rises. It saidthe rises would badly affect the lower paid and the old,despite government pledges to protect their purchasing power.    Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, whose banned organisationhas been replaced by the OPZZ, condemned the increases in frontof a crowd of 1,500 cheering supporters at St Brygida's RomanCatholic Church in the Baltic port of Gdansk.    "For the first time in six years (since Solidarity wasbanned), I say enough. For the first time, I am decidedlyagainst. I am against price rises as being the only sign ofreform," Walesa said.    "I am for reforms. I favour the reforms which (Soviet leaderMikhail) Gorbachev is carrying out  ... But I am not in favourof make-believe reforms," he said. REUTER&#3;
