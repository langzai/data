Oil prices have stabilized in worldmarkets and demand is likely to increase in the second half ofthe year, Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said.    He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oilprices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixedprice OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demandhave been in equilibrium since March.    If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said.    But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mlnbarrels at its next meeting in June.    He said in his speech that world oil production over thelast two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or twomln barrels a day less than world oil demand.    Oil production by industrialized countries, particularlythe U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, butsome of that slack will be taken up by increased production inCameroon, India and other developing countries, he said.    This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oilproducers and consumers in the industrialized world for theupper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlierspeech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.    "If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resumeits former role in world oil markets," he said.    "But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years,"Subroto said. REUTER&#3;
