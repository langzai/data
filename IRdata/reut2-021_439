French Finance Minister Edouard Balladurissued a firm call for the continued faithful application ofthe Louvre accords on currency stability by all majorindustrial countries.    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look atthe accords, said "I firmly desire a faithfull and firmadherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvreaccords -- in both their letter and spirit."    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term WestGerman interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, calledfor stability among the major currencies after a prolongeddollar slide.    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven FinanceMinisters in Washington last month.    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German raterise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."    "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us tosimply sit back here and accept increased tightening on theirpart on the assumption that somehow we are going to followthem," he added.
