The Treasury Department said itnotified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles andAruba.    The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasurysaid in a two-sentence announcement.    The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiationsbetween the United States and the Netherlands over the pasteight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesmansaid.    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies ofEurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will nolonger be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, thespokesman said.    Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most havematurities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, thespokesman said.    He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have anadverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the generaldecline in interest rates means they will be able to refinanceat lower interest rates.    However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be facedwith lower yields. Reuter&#3;
