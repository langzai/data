The investor group that has agreed tobuy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personalcomputer retailer public or sell it to other investors,industry analysts said.    "Now's a good time," said Joe Levy of International DataCorp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and ison the way up again," he said.    Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PCretailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought byan investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.    Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management andventure capital firm, would disclose the value of thetransaction.    Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 storesgenerated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners payroyalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.    Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions toComputerland. Computerland officials could not immediately bereached for comment.    E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venturecapital funds, and its past investments have included MattelInc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a moneymanager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.   Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strongupturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make keychanges if it is to fend off advances from rivals likeBusinessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shackstores. "The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,customer service and customer support," said Levy ofInternational Data.    Relations between Computerland and its franchise ownershave mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give upmanagment control of the company in 1985.    Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executiveofficer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quellmuch of the franchisee dissent.    Reuter&#3;
