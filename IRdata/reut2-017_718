Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation Chairman L. William Seidman told a bankers' meetinghe thinks more banks will follow Citicorp and Chase Manhattanin building up their reserves to meet Latin American debtproblems.    Seidman, speaking to an American Bankers Association tradeconference, said he did not think regulators would play as biga role in encouraging banks to build up their loan-lossreserves as the marketplace.    "My guess is that we as regulators won't become the keyfactor. I think the market system will get most of the otherbanks to follow suit," Seidman said.    In the past two weeks, Citicorp added three billion dlrsand Chase Manhattan 1.6 billion to loan-loss reserves. Reuter&#3;
