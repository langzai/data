Ecuadorean President Leon Febres Corderosaid his country was unilaterally suspending payments toprivate foreign banks due to last week's earthquake whichcaused up to one billion dollars in damage.    Febres Cordero, quoted in an Information Ministrycommunique, said: "We have to ratify this suspension ... on debtservice to the private international banks.    "I am not ashamed to say it, there definitely isn't a way topay," he said.    Ecuador had already suspended payments to private foreignbanks, holding two-thirds of Ecuador's 8.16 billion dollarforeign debt, from last January due to a cash-flow squeezestemming from a slide in world oil prices last year.    But finance officials had earlier said the length of thesuspension would depend on negotiations with private foreignbanks.    The information ministry communique said febres corderomade these statments to reporters at lago agrio, at the heartof ecuador's region of jungle oilfields, before returning toquito.    Febres cordero said up to a total of 1,000 people died orwere missing in avalanches and mudslides during the march 5earthquake.    The tremor damaged an oil pipeline, thus barring all crudeexports for a projected five months. Oil accounts for up totwo-thrids of ecuador's total exoprts and for as much as 60 percent of the government's revenues.    He did not specify for how long the suspension of paymentswould last.    Ecuador owes private foreign banks 450 to 500 mln dlrs ininterest payments for the rest of the year and 66 mln dlrsin principal payments maturing in 1987, finance officials said.    Finance minister domingo cordovez said two days ago thegovernment seeks to postpone all the payments due to privateforeign banks in 1987 until next year through negotiations withthese creditors.
