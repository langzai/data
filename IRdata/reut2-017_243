Chancellor Helmut Kohl has decided tokeep Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in office for afurther eight years, the news magazine Der Spiegel said.    Government officials were not immediately available tocomment on the report, which said that because Poehl is amember of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Kohl had not takenthe decision lightly.    Poehl has been Bundesbank chief since January 1, 1980,while Kohl's conservative/liberal coalition has held powersince 1982.    Der Spiegel said Kohl would have preferred to offer thepost to a member of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU).    But the magazine noted Poehl enjoyed a good internationalreputation. Officials have often said Poehl and CDU FinanceMinister Gerhard Stoltenberg hold each other in high regard.    Poehl's current term expires at the end of this year.Officials have said no date has been set for an announcement onwhether his tenure will be extended.    Poehl was made an economic adviser to SPD Chancellor WillyBrandt in 1971. A year later he was appointed State Secretaryat the Finance Ministry when former SPD Chancellor HelmutSchmidt was Finance Minister.    There has recently been press speculation that theBundesbank presidency may be offered to Poehl's deputy, HelmutSchlesinger, a conservative monetarist.    According to these reports, Schlesinger would be replacedtwo years later by CDU member Hans Tietmeyer, the currentFinance Ministry State Secretary.    Also under discussion as president was Johann WilhelmGaddum, a member of the Bundesbank board and a CDU member whois known to be close to Kohl. REUTER&#3;
