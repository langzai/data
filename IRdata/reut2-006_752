GAMCO Investors Inc, an affiliate ofGabelli and Co, plans to propose an anti-greenmail provision atthe GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31, according to GAMCOChairman Mario Gabelli.    Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at apremium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp todayreceived a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8pct of its stock.    Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to theSecurities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorpstock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.    The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it wasreported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passiveinvestors to show holdings of more than five pct.    Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brownand AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tenderoffer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and20 dlrs per share too low.    GenCorp has made no comment on the offer.    Gabelli said he also proposes that management considerspinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcastproperties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcastproperties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.    "One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going tothe meeting and putting up "no greenmail," Gabelli said.    Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivationin the offer.    The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio. Reuter&#3;
