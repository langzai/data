The Swiss National Bank bought dollarsagainst yen today, a spokesman for the bank said.    He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or whenprecisely it intervened.    Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the NationalBank's purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than20 or 30 mln dlrs.    The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollarsagainst the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banksas well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japandollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs.    Dealers said this tended to confirm the market's impressionthat major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meetingon an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen, and the marketseemed ready to test it.    Commercial clients were also selling dollars against theyen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drewcloser. Today's dealings in spot currencies are booked forMarch 31.    One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies hadbeen asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at thispoint, but some, while sticking to the letter of that request,were offering dollars forward today, rather than lose out ifthe dollar fell further.    The run on the dollar against the yen came in a marketthinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meetingin Hamburg.    Trading was, in fact, rather light against currencies otherthan the yen, the dollar holding little changed through theday.    The market now expected the U.S. Federal Reserve tointervene in support of the dollar. "But they will probably doit only half-heartedly, so I don't think it will matter toomuch on rates," one dealer said. REUTER&#3;
