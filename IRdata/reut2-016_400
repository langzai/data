Irving Bank Corp said a six pct dropin first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely theresult of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers inBrazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrsfrom 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per sharedropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.    Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs ofEcuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter netincome by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.    Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mlndlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received onthese loans during the remainder of 1987.    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on thetrading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,although these were partly offset by increased trust income,profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securitiesgains, the bank said.    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986. Reuter&#3;
