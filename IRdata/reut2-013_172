The United States defended its salesof stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism fromMalaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement withsoutheast Asian producers.    "The United States has continued to abide by the spirit ofthe memorandum of understanding and has consulted with theASEAN states on GSA tin disposals," a State Department spokesmansaid in a statement.    "The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken intoaccount in determining disposal levels," the statement said.    The United States and the ASEAN countries signed amemorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by theU.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983.    In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamberof Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, wellabove an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. "The UnitedStates appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandumof Understanding," it said.    The State Department statement said GSA tin disposalsincreased in calendar year 1986 due to changed marketconditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987,they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986.    The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin theGSA sold last year, however.
