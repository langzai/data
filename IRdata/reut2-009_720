The price of gold bullion is likelyto rise in the second half of the year on increased privateinvestor demand, West German analysts said.    Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later thisyear, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche LandesbankGirozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by theU.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.    "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stockexchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned forfurther rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, manyinvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stockexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG'sforeign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold ispoised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second halfof this year.    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs anounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said. REUTER&#3;
