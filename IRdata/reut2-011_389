Westinghouse Electric Corp &lt;WX>,which designed Brazil's only nuclear plant, has agreed to pay50 mln dlrs compensation for errors made during the project,the plant's operators said.    A spokesman for &lt;Furnas Centrais Eletricas>, a stateutility which runs the Angra One power station, confirmed astatement made in Washington last week by company presidentCamilo Penna.    Penna did not say what errors had been made and the utilityspokesman said he could not add to Penna's statement.    The 636-megawatt plant, dogged by technical problems,started operating in January 1985, but since January 1986 hasnot worked at all due to a variety of problems, the utilityspokesman said.    The country originally intended to have eight more powerstations after Angra One, using West German technology.    Work on one plant, Angra Two, began and then stopped whenfunding ran out. Penna told the Jornal do Brasil that the stateutility was receiving money from the government to finish AngraTwo and build another plant, Angra Three. REUTER&#3;
