Belgium, current holder of the EuropeanCommunity presidency, appears ready to drop a controversialoils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm pricepackage, diplomats said.    In a discussion document prepared for today's summitmeeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called"stabilising mechanism" be the subject of "further study andconsultation with the Community's main trading partners."    The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne onboth imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marineoils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.    The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row atthe summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm pricetalks, contained the first formal reference to dropping themeasure.    Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency onJune 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They aresupported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesserextent, Spain.    Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomatssaid, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for afurther six months was certain to survive any redrafting. REUTER&#3;
