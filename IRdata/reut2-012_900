The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senatevoted to slash foreign aid to Panama because of drugtrafficking, but sided with President Reagan by refusing to cutU.S. aid to Mexico as a protest it is failing to cooperatefully with the American war against drugs.    In what Senate opponents of a cutoff said was a surprise,the Senate voted 58 to 31 to halve aid to Panama.    The measure, which the administration opposes, would needHouse approval before any aid would be stopped.    Panama is due to receive 28.5 mln dlrs in U.S. aid thisyear. A spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations committeesaid if the House approves the measure too, half of this aidwould be stopped. Reuter&#3;
