Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigesaid the U.S. trade deficit should start to decline soon,possibly in the figures for February or March.    "We could see the trade deficit start down in February orMarch," Baldrige said in an appearance before the SenateGovernmental Affairs Committee.    He predicted the trade deficit, which was 170 billion dlrsin 1986, would decline by 30 to 40 billion dlrs in 1987 and in1988.    Baldrige said he was making his prediction without havingseen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume ofimports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986and will continue to drop in this quarter.    The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures willreflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said.    Ealier, Treasury Secretary James Baker told the committeethat the trade deficit had levelled off, but Baldrige said hewas more optimistic, adding, "I think we turned the corner inFebruary." Reuter&#3;
