The council of theAustralian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said itwill press on with its campaign for major improvements toAustralia's petroleum taxation structure.    The council said in a statement the industry was bitterlydisappointed by the Australian government's position ontaxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and EnergyMinister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.    As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to targetany tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach tosecondary taxation of petroleum.    APEA had expected the government to make positive responsesto detailed industry submissions seeking the removal ofexisting secondary tax disincentives to exploration anddevelopment, the council said.    It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised byEvans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceedwith the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.    Evans told the conference the government did not plan toaccept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allowdeductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.    "The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction ofunsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshorearea in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax isprofit based," the APEA council said.    The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oilexploration companies that it had realistic answers to theindustry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry'sproblems, the council said.    The industry has called for the end of all discriminatorysecondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as majordisincentives at a time of low oil prices. REUTER&#3;
