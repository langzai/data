An agreement in the debt reschedulingtalks between the Philippines and its commercial bank advisorycommittee seems to be close at hand, said David Mulford,Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.    "The Philippines negotiations resumed in early March andagreement now appears to be very near," Mulford told a debtconference, organized by the Euromoney magazine.    Mulford gave no further details. He told reporters afterhis speech that he had no information on the banks' response tothe Philippines' revised proposal, based on partial payment ofinterest with investment notes instead of cash.    Progress in the Philippines talks, following recentagreements with Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, will help todispel concerns of a new debt crisis, Mulford told theconference.    However, he said there will continue to be difficulties andperiods of significant risk, requiring creative thinking on thepart of the banks.    In particular, he urged the banks to develop a "menu ofoptions for supporting debtor reforms as a means of maintainingbroad bank participation in new financing packages."    Mulford said the banks should be able to offer a range ofoptions to members of the lending syndicates, provided that theliquidity value of the total transactions to the debtor nationsis equivalent to the banks' new money obligation.    He said it is more important to find ways of encouragingbanks to remain in the syndicates than to find ways of enablingthem to quit the lending groups.    Mulford said his menu of options could include more tradecredits, direct portfolio investments, debt/equity swaps,project loans, co-financings and the invesmtent note concept,which has been proposed by the Philippines.
