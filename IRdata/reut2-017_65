The Dutch central bank has intervenedin the currency markets today, in apparent concerted actionwith other central banks, foreign exchange dealers said.    They detected selling of the yen for dollars, which someestimated would run to a moderate 200 mln guilders, comparableto token Dutch intervention reported last week.    Other dealers, however, said they believed today's moderateintervention had been in guilders against dollar.    The dealers agreed the intervention was minimal and more apolitical gesture than a market moving force. REUTER&#3;
