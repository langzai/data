The French government said it proposed the creation of a new facility for development and fordebt reduction under the framework of the World Bank.    In a statement issued in conjunction with the meeting ofthe International Monetary Fund's policy-making InterimCommittee, the French said the "multilateral resources thuscollected would permit a partial refinancing on highlyconcessional terms of previously rescheduled official debts."    The statement said the "French government believes it isnecessary to take new steps to deal with the issue of thepoorest countries' debt."    The French statement said that Paris club reschedulingsshould have a lengthening of the repayment period up to between15 and 20 years instead of the current limit of 10 years.    And grace periods would be extended.    "These measures would be confined to the poorest, heavilyindebted countries and would be decided on a case-by-casebasis," it said.    The French also called for making the IMF's compensatoryfinancing facility for export shortfalls more concessional. Reuter&#3;
