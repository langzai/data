Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> has developed asimulation processor which will operate faster than anycomputer and will speed development of the next generation ofcomputers, a spokesman told Reuters.    The simulation processor will halve the time needed forfault testing the millions of basic logic circuits incorporatedin the latest computers, he said.    It can simulate the operation of as many as 530 mln logicelements a second if a maximum of 64 processors areinterconnected. The simulation processor, which took four yearsto develop, will not be marketed, he said. REUTER&#3;
