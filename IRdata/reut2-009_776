American Eagle gold bullion coinsales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first yearon the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope,director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists.    World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it worldmarket leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.    Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all goldEagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were inEurope and about eight pct in Asia.    She said despite introduction of several new gold bullioncoins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preservethe Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.    The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,as long as this is available at market prices. The remaininggold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from theopen market, Pope said.    Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition herefrom the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent fromthe South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf'sWest German market share at 60 pct.    The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buygold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pctvalue-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ouncecoins traded today at 906 marks, they said.    Competition may also come from new gold coins, includingBelgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australiaalso have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said. REUTER&#3;
