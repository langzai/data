World Bank Vice-President DavidKnox said creditor banks must become more flexible in providingfunds for Latin American debtor nations.    "The international creditor banks must make their positionmore flexible, ensuring a flow of funds for Latin Americancountries, especially the most indebted," Knox told the semi-official newsagency Telam.    Knox said Brazil's decision last month to suspend paymentson a large portion of its foreign debt had shocked the creditorbanks. The banks were "in no hurry to provide funds for thedebtor nations," he said.    But he said the situation of debtor nations transferringfunds to the developed should be reversed. "It must be the otherway round, to make development in indebted states possible."    He said the World Bank was supplying special lines ofcredit to make up for this inflexibility on the part of thebanks. It had increased its involvement in development projectsby 60 pct in the last two years, he said.    Knox said banks would grant Argentina loans of up to twobillion dlrs over the next two years to help the country meetgrowth targets. Argentina is currently negotiating a 2.15billion dlr loan with creditor banks for 1987. REUTER&#3;
