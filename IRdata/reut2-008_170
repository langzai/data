Australian wheat plantings areforecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF)said in its first preliminary crop forecast.    But there was no reason to expect Australian production in1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year,the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales andQueensland suffered from poor yields last season.    Most of the fall in plantings was expected in WesternAustralia while state average yields would be assisted bygrowers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.    The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was apoor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. Butin the eastern states the wheat area should hold up providedthat rainfall between now and June is not less than average,AWF said.    Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut backwheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since theyneeded cash flow and there were problems with alternativecrops.    "The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses andoats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise ahigh proportion of growers' income," AWF said.
