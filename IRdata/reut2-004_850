ecuador cannot service its debt owed toprivate foreign banks due to the earthquake that forced asuspension of crude oil exports, central bank officials said.    "we hope to obtain a tacit, explicit acceptance from foreignbanks ... that we are not able to service the debt," centralbank president carlos julio emanuel said.    "the reality is that our debt service capacity has beentotally affected by the recent cataclysm," he added in a newsconference last night.    A central bank spokesman said emanuel was referring topayments owed private foreign banks, already suspended sincejanuary. These banks hold two-thirds of the country's 8.16billion dollar foreign debt.    Emanuel was not refering to debts to foreign governmentsand multilateral organisations, the spokesman said.    The march 5 earthquake damaged an oil pipeline, preventingcrude exports for a projected five months. Oil generates abouttwo-thirds of ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 percent of the government's revenues.    Emanuel did not specify how long ecuador would be unableservice private foreign banks. But finance minister domingocordovez said two days ago the government is seeking topostpone all payments due to private foreign banks in 1987until next year through negotiations with creditors.    Emanuel said ecuador was seeking soft loans frommultilateral organisations for reconstruction work. It alsowanted a "reprogramming" of already-approved loans, an apparentreference to the disbursement schedule of thee credits. Reuter&#3;
