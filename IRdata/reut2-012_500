The company said it was able to declare the dividend due toprogress in the cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two.    A company spokesman said GPU expects to continue declaringdividends on a quarterly basis, with the rate depending on theprogress of the cleanup and on other company operations.    GPU said the dividend is of "modest size," representingless than a third of the amount paid as a dividend by theaverage electric utility.    "As the operating companies need to return to the capitalmarkets for debt and preferred stock, this should tend toproduce lower cost and better terms," the company said.    The dividend is payable May 29 to holders of record April24. Reuter&#3;
