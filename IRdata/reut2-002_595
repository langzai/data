Standard and Poor's Corp said debtratings on 840 mln dlrs of debt of Baker International Corp andHughes Tool Co remain on creditwatch.    S and P cited the adjournment of a special shareholdermeeting in which Hughes objected to certain conditions for themerger of the companies set by the U.S. Justice Department.    If the merger is consumated, S and P would rate the newlyformed Baker Hughes Inc senior debt at A-minus, subordinateddebt at BBB-plus and commercial paper at A-2. But if the mergerdoes not occur, Baker's senior debt would be cut to A-minusfrom A and commercial paper to A-2 from A-1.    Without the merger, Hughes Tool's current ratings of B-plusfor senior debt, B-minus for subordinated debt and C forcommercial paper would be affirmed, S and P said.    That would reflect the continuation of dismal industryconditions and the company's substantially weaker creditprofile, S and P explained. Reuter&#3;
