Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, facingan increasingly violent wave of labour unrest, has toldSpaniards he is determined to bring down inflation even if itmeans slower growth and fewer votes for his Socialist Party.    In a 50-minute television interview broadcast live,Gonzalez criticized widespread protests which have blown upless than a year after he won a resounding general electionvictory.    "It seems so important to us that sometimes I ask myself'Why don't they understand when I explain this?'" Gonzalez saidof the anti-inflation strategy designed to modernise Spain andmake its economy competitive within the European Community.    Gonzalez said the illegal work-to-rule at the airline wasgrounding more and more planes and producing a backlog ofmaintenance work which would not be cleared until the summer.    "The comfortable thing to do would be to give in and have noproblems," the 44-year-old prime minister said, adding thatnothing could justify the use of violence in a democracy.    Gonzalez said he still believed it was possible to reduceinflation to five pct this year from the current rate of 6.3pct, even though other government officials have admitted thetarget may now be beyond reach.
