Republican members of the HouseAgriculture Committee said they will propose amendmentstomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for theexport enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expandingthe scope of the program.    At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they wouldpropose expanding EEP to include all countries "willing topurchase additional commodities at reasonable prices."    In addition, the Congressmen said they would proposeextending the life of EEP to five years from the current threeyears and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billiondlrs from 1.5 billion at present.    The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin draftingamendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.    Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture SecretaryRichard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said theyfavor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of anacross-the-board program which they termed too costly.    The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer anamendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. AgricultureDepartment to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at themarket value, rather than the cost of acquisition.    But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market valueaccounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoidhitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.    Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mlndlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Usingacquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher. Reuter&#3;
