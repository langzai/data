The world trade body GATT said itsnegotiators in Geneva are discussing a possible agreement for aceiling on agricultural subsidies.    GATT director-general for agriculture Jean-Marc Lucq toldreporters here that the talks had not got anywhere yet as theparticipants were still reluctant to lay all their cards on thetable.    He said the ceilings under discussion would only be appliedto those members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradewith high subsidy spending.    Lucq said a survey by the Organisation for EconomicCo-operation and Development showed that its 24 member westernindustrialised countries subsidised their agriculture by atotal average of more than 100 billion dlrs a year from1979-81.    Within that total, the U.S. Spent 26 billion dlrs, Japan 24billion, and the European Community 57 billion dlrs.    Yves Berthelot, an official for the United NationsConference on Trade and Development, said the suppression ofagricultural subsidies in temperate countries, which wouldallow a resurgence of world prices and a lowering of domesticprices, would be difficult but inevitable.
