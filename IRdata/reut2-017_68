Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidJapan has no plans to take new emergency measures to supportthe dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.    He also told reporters that many major nations yesterdayintervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.    Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of thecountries involved and the amounts expended, he said.    With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japanmight take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such ascurbing capital outflows.    Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise inU.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although thegrowth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality arenot that good, he said.    He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) isexpected to come up with a final set of recommendations of waysto stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.    Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuringby a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said itwas important to put the panel's recommendations into effect. REUTER&#3;
