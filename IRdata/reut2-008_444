Energy analyst Edward Krapels saidthe United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S.dependence on imports below 50 pct.    "On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent,variable import tariff is most persuasive," Krapels, presidentof Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a HouseEnergy and Power subcommittee hearing.    "An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if theinternational price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs abarrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise taxon transportation fuels," Krapels said.    But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with theoil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove pricecontrols on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oilcompanies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide taxincentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserveexisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging fillingthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate.    Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told thesubcommittee oil imports were expected to increase becausefunds for exploration and development of domestic oil sourcescannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices.
