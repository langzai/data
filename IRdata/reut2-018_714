France's leading farmer's union, theFNSEA, said it is worried that negotiations on the 1987/88 farmprice package will now be tackled by European Community leaderswho do not know the agricultural situation.    The leaders have no specialised knowledge of the farmdossier and have the tendency to sign compromises which are "toobroad," union leader Raymond Lacombe said. But he added FrenchFarm Minister Francois Guillaume had reason to reject acompromise which would have been negative for the farm sector.    EC ministers ended talks this morning having failed to getany agreement on agricultural prices for the 1987/88 farm year,which started on April 1 for certain products.    Lacombe said the French government should guaranteefarmers' incomes until an agreement is reached. Reuter&#3;
