U.S. House Ways and MeansCommittee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Congresswould more readily respond to the needs of the U.S. futuresindustry to be internationally competitive if the industryshowed a willingness to do its business honestly.    Rostenkowski told the Futures Industry Association that ifother countries were relaxing futures regulations "because oursare being tightened, so that they can take a competitiveadvantage, I think we (Congress) have a responsibility to keepyou out in front."    But he warned the futures leaders that they "have a moreimportant reponsibility to do your business honestly. You can'tignore the trader who is improperly using his opportunity."    There have been reports recently of futures traders placingtheir own orders ahead of clients'. The Chicago MercantileExchange is considering curbing the right of traders in theStandard and Poor's 500 pit to trade for their own and clients'accounts.    "If we can see that there is a responsible response frompeople in your industry, we will be the first there to help." hesaid. Reuter&#3;
