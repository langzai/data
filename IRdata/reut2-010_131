Moody's Investors Service Inc said itmay downgrade British Petroleum Co PLC's 3.5 billion dlrs ofdebt and Standard Oil Co's 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.    The agency cited British Petroleum's 7.4 billion dlr tenderoffer today for the remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil shares itdoes not already own.    Moody's said that while British Petroleum has greatlystrengthened its capital structure over the past few years,this acquisition would seriously affect the company'sliquidity, leverage and interest coverage.    Moody's noted that British Petroleum would use more thantwo billion dlrs of excess cash and marketables and about fivebillion dlrs of new acquisition debt to fund the transaction.    In addition, the minority interest and deferred incometaxes attributable to Standard Oil would be excluded fromBritish Petroleum's capitalization. That would result in atotal debt to capital ratio of nearly 50 pct, Moody's said.    The rating agency said it would study B.P.'s strategy torestore financial flexibility after the acquisition. Moody'ssaid that may include divestiture of various petroleum andnon-petroleum assets and operations of B.P. and Standard.    But Moody's noted that after the major asset writedown anddivestiture progress achieved by Standard Oil in 1985, fewernon-petroleum assets are available for sale.    Under review are the A-1 senior debt of issues guaranteedby British Petroleum, including Eurobonds of BP Capital B.V.,debentures of BP North America Finance Corp, Eurodebt ofBritish Petroleum B.V., BPCA Finance Ltd and BP CanadianHoldings Ltd, debentures and medium-term notes of BP NorthAmerica Inc.
