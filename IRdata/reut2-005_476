Sources close to the Italian state creditinstitution (Istituto Mobiliare Italiano - IMI) said aconvertible bond issue was one of the possibilities beingstudied to facilitate market absorption of Fiat shares soldlast year by Libya and still in the hands of banks.    The sources could give no further details of the optionsunder study.    A Fiat spokesman contacted by Reuters said the company hadno comment to make on the possibility of a convertible bondissue, saying any decision to be taken "did not depend on Fiat."    Italian press reports that a bond issue was under studypushed Fiat's shares higher on the Milan bourse today.    The company's ordinary shares closed in Milan today at12,540 lire in Milan today, up from a closing 12,195 Friday.    Fiat preference shares and savings (non-voting) sharesgained even more strongly, closing at 7,740 and 7,841 lirerespectively against 7,353 and 7,600 Friday.    Bourse dealers say the fall in value of Fiat stock over thelast six months partly reflects selling by foreign operators ofshares acquired as a result of the 2.1 billion dlr equity offerafter Libya sold its minority stake last September.    On September 23, 1986, the day Fiat announced it hadreached an agreement under which Libya would sell its 15 pctstake, Fiat shares closed in Milan at 16,600 lire. Since then,the trend has been down.    Last September's share offer, which triggered criticism byunderwriters about the handling of the sale, opened at asubstantial discount to its offer price, resulting in lossesfor holders of the shares.    Some analysts have said the size of offer was too big forthe market to handle efficiently. REUTER&#3;
