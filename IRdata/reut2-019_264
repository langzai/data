Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bedcombustion technology, a method for the more efficient burningof solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Coloradodue to high costs.    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. SyntheticFuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology atthe oil shale plant. In return the company would have beeneligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supportsfrom the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contractfrom the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidizedbed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat andelectricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investmenttax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the projectuneconomical even with government price supports and loanguarantees, Unocal said.    The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said. Reuter&#3;
