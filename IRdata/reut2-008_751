The debt is covered by a standstill agreement that expiresJune 30.    Under the new accord, the standstill will be extended forthree years to June 30, 1990.    There will be an immediate repayment of three pct to allthe banks, to be followed by various payments at six-monthintervals over the life of the agreement totalling some 1.5billion dlrs.    The three pct payment will be due July 15, 1987.
