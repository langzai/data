The Bank of Finland said it wasreducing restrictions on the use of money market rates asreference rates for loans.    The Bank would start quoting money market rates referred toas HELIBOR (Helsinki Interbank Offered Rate). Banks mayhenceforth use these as reference rates in their lending, itsaid.    From May 1 the banks would be allowed, without specialcentral bank approval, to use as a reference rate not only itsbase rate but also other Bank of Finland rates or the officialmoney market rate used in market transactions.    A derivative of these could also be used, the statementsaid. But housing loans would be excepted and their lendingrate would, as formerly, be linked directly or indirectly tothe Bank of Finland's base rate.    The new guidelines involve mainly two changes. Money marketrates in future would be used as reference rates for loans witha maturity of over five years and the introduction of a newreference rate would no longer require central bank approval.    The decision was made as a continuation of the centralbank's process of liberalisation, it said. REUTER&#3;
