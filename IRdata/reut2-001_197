Soviet imports of soymeal may reach orexceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,the Oil World newsletter said.    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reducesoybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from theEuropean Community and South America in the January/Marchquarter, with additional large quantities likely to be importedin the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, itsaid. No figures were given for imports in the correspondingperiods of 1986.    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases ofprobably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseedand large scale butter imports that were expected from Marchonward, it said.    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grainarea due to recent severe frosts were probably behind therecent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.    It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn hadbeen bought recently by the Soviet Union. Reuter&#3;
