MCI Communications Corp. called forimmediate federal deregulation of American Telephone andTelegraph Co., its principal competitor.    MCI said it will ask the Federal Communications Commissiontomarrow to deregulate ATT in order to let marketplace forcesgovern the long distance telephone market.    "It's time to let the market manage ATT," MCI president BertRoberts told a news briefing here.    MCI has seen its profits shaved recently by ATT longdistance rate reductions ordered by the FCC following thebreakup of the Bell System.    The MCI move signals its belief that ATT may raise profitsrather than cut rates if deregulated.    To allay consumers' fears that deregulation might lead toprice increases, Roberts said one alternative open to the FCCwould be adoption of a transitional "price cap" concept.    Roberts noted that such a plan is backed by FCCcommissioner Dennis Patrick, whose is widely expected to benamed FCC chairman.    Roberts conceded that ATT's deregulation posed risks toMCI.    "The greater risk, however, is continuing the artificialmarket environment created by piecemeal FCC deregulation ofATT." Reuter&#3;
