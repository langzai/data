The U.S. Commodity Futures TradingCommission (CFTC) released guidelines on how commodity tradingadvisors (CTA) should calculate "beginning net asset value"(BNAV) for purposes of computing rates of return required bycommission disclosure rules.    The commission said it was compelled to release theguidelines because it has received disclosure documents whichindicate "serious differences" in the way certain CTAs aredefining BNAW -- "differences that may have compromised theability to compare rates of return among different advisors."    CFTC said CTAs must only use funds under their control orin conjunction with their carrying futures commission merchantsin calculating BNAV.    Computation of BNAV must exclude any item that is notmoney, securities or other tangible property and any funds thatare not under the control of the CTA, or CTA in conjunctionwith its carrying futures commission merchant.    CFTC said "notational" funds must be excluded because theyare merely verbal promises to furnish funds.    Funds in a commodity trading account over which a CTA hasdiscretionary trading authority must be included, CFTC said. Reuter&#3;
