Pacific Gas and Electric Co saidit will ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to changefederal regulations requiring the utility to buy electricityfrom unregulated private producers.    Prices paid for this power under long term contracts signedbefore last year's fall in world oil prices now are more thantwice as high as the actual value of the electricity, PacificGas said.    Under the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Actutilities are required to buy electricity from cogenerationfacilities, which produce both steam and electricity.    Since 1980, Pacific Gas has signed power purchaseagreements, required by the law, with long-term priceguarantees for more than 8,480 megawatts of capacity fromprivate producers, the company said.    About 1,870 MW of that capacity is already on line, andaccounted for about eight pct of the company's total energysales in 1986, Pacific Gas said.    The company said it will ask FERC to amend the rulesrequiring purchase of this power so that the price paid for theelectricity reflects current market values, and that utilitiesbe required to buy only electricity needed in the near term.    Contracts with cogeneration and other small power projectscould cost Pacific Gas' consumers as much as 857 mln dlrsannually by 1990, the company said.    The 857 mln dlrs represents the difference between whatPacific Gas would pay for power from private producers and thecost to the company to produce the power on its own or buy itelsewhere, Pacific Gas said.
