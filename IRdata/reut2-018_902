High wage settlements in Nordic countriesthreaten to cut exports and reduce the internationalcompetitiveness of their industries, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded inearly 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deteriorationin competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seenat risk from accelerating wages.    The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come underpressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well asNorway, Sweden and Finland.    Overall economic growth will vary in the differentcountries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual reportsaid.    After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domesticdemand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and onepct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see aslump in domestic demand. The report said growth in GrossDomestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly inSweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmarkand Norway.    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economicstrategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustainedand balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said. REUTER&#3;
