Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowingto 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986,and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicingpayments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, DimitrisHalikias, said.    He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceededimmediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of lowinternational interest rates in order to make servicingpayments at a lower cost.    Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs atend-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said.    He said the extra funds available to Greece this year willgo towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did notgive figures.    He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-yearausterity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its currentaccount deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record3.3 billion in 1985.    Halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach acurrent account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year.    He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need forimports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive.    Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billiondlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in thesame. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrsfrom 11.4 billion.
