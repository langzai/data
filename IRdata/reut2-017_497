India's state-owned Oil and Natural GasCommission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombayoffshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gaveboth oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.    The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gasper day, he said.    "The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oiland gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells inthere before starting production on a commercial scale."    Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshorefield, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for thelast two years.    ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 endingMarch, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accountedfor 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.    ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developedsince the late 1970s, for more oil as production from BombayHigh has reached a plateau. REUTER&#3;
