Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> expects adifficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chiefexecutive Werner Dieter told a news conference.    Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn inforeign business because of lower energy prices and the highermark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customernations.    Domestic business was also declining and orders for WestGerman engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,Dieter said.    Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.    Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer aset- back, although measures to cut costs, which were startedlast year, were now having an effect.    Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related productsaccounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. Thecompany saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dietersaid had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims."    He said the company's drive to combine activities inmechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "pluspoint" for Mannesmann.    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to takea majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts groupfor an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fallnine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group netprofit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollarand lack of demand for steel pipe.    Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipewere bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he addedthe company would continue to cut personnel in this sector thisyear. REUTER&#3;
