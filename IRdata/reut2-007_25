The Banking Commission is reviewingthe present three-tier banking system and its newly establishedcapital adequacy ratio, banking commissioner Robert Fell said.    He told a news conference his office has had talks with theBank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board onrisk-based capital ratios, following an agreement on suchstandards between the two central banks early this year.    The Bank of England and the Fed are trying to persuade theBank of Japan and European central banks to accept theirstandards.    "We welcome international standards," Fell said. "It means alevel playing field for all."    Under a new banking rule that came into effect last year,banks in Hong Kong are given a two-year grace period to meet afive pct capital adequacy requirement.    "The difference between us (Hong Kong and the U.K.) isreally not that great," he said.    Fell said the majority of banks are comfortable with therequired capital ratio, though some are under-capitalised.    Some banks, mostly Japanese, want a lower capital ratiobecause of the special nature of their business, mainlyoffshore banking operations. These institutions have proposedthe creation of a limited service bank category.    Financial institutions in Hong Kong are now classified intothree types -- banks, registered and licensed deposit-takingcompanies.    Fell said the Commission is reviewing the three-tierstructure in light of the possible changes in capital ratio andthe growing trend towards securitisation of debt.    Fell said the Commission is also studying a set ofguidelines on loan loss provisions with the help of the Societyof Accountants.    Other planned guidelines relate to securitisation of debtand business that banks and deposit taking companies canconduct. REUTER&#3;
