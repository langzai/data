The elimination of price limits onprecious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange inNew York appears to be having little effect on the market,analysts said.    "There is nothing apparent from the change," said WilliamO'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc."The market has not approached the old price limits and tradingis relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he added.    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs onmarket moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weakerin the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.    On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the twocontracts following spot after a volatile market in silverfutures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.    During the last week of April, silver futures traded up anddown the price limit in the back months, causing traders torush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analystssaid.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was muchconfusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.    The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firmsa total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched tradesin a timely manner.    Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in thenearby contracts amid quiet trading today.    O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEXmetals futures would add caution to trading since all contractscould move any distance.    "This is amore realistic approach because the metals marketis a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"O'Neill said.    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panicbuying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.    Reuter&#3;
