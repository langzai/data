The Federal CommunicationsCommission voted at a meeting to ease a requirement that cabletelevision firms must provide a signal-selector switch free ofcharge to all customers.    The so-called A/B switch is attached to a television setand permits a viewer to turn from cable programs toover-the-air broadcast stations which cable companies mustcarry.    After the rule was criticized the FCC changed it so thatcable firms would have to provide the switch only if a customerrequested it and could charge a fee. Reuter&#3;
