Federal Reserve Board Vice ChairmanManuel Johnson said that the U.S.'s main industrial partnersshould expand their domestic growth.    In a speech to a women's group here, Johnson said, "There isroom for stronger domestic growth in those countries ... strongenough to absorb growth in U.S. export markets."    Johnson also said there was a better alignment of exchangerates now and the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies hasbrought western nations a long way towards establishing thatgoal.    Johnson said, "The Fed supports this pattern of exchangerates ... and we'll see if it leads to a convergence in trade.Quite possibly it can be achieved."    Johnson said the Paris agreement achieved a betteralignment of exchange rates in exchange for stimulus by themajor surplus countries.    He said this was "a major improvement and a step in theright direction" and added U.S. allies look very strongly to aU.S. budget deficit cut. "There will always be a potential riskof breakdown in international cooperation" without a budgetdeficit cut. Reuter&#3;
