A former vice president of PainewebberInc pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal Court to charges heconspired to launder over 700,000 dlrs in cash from investors.    Gary Eder, 41, PaineWebber's highest paid broker between1982-86, was indicted last week on charges of conspiracy andfalsifying brokerage records.    Eder, who resigned from the firm earlier this year,admitted he received cash from various clients, and convertedthe funds to smaller amounts to avoid reporting requirements bythe U.S. Internal Revenue Service.    Eder said he did not profit directly from the transactionsexcept for the commissions he received.    U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri scheduled May 27 forsentencing. Eder could receive up to five years in jail on eachcount and 260,000 dlrs in fines.    Eder had been accused of plotting with unidentifiedsupervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of currencytransaction reports with the IRS. Under U.S. law, cashtransactions of 10,000 dlrs or more must be reported to theIRS.    David Spears, the Federal prosecutor in charge of the case,said Eder received cash from customers in amounts up to 70,000dlrs at one time, and then broke the cash down into amountsunder 10,000 dlrs and put the money into accounts on severaldifferent days.    Outside of Court, Eder's lawyer, Milton Gould, said hisclient was not involved in the ongoing Wall Street insidertrading scandel. Rather, Gould said, "Eder accomodated somewealthy customers (who wanted to avoid taxes)." Reuter&#3;
