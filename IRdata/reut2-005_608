The United States today dismissed asinsignificant gains by Iranian forces in Northern Iraq.    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reportersthe gain in an area around Mount Kardemand had no signifficantbearing on the seven-year-old Gulf war.    Press reports from the region said the Iranian push hadplaced its forces to move against the road to Rawandiz, some 60miles (96 KM) north of major Iraqi oil fields and refineriesand the Turkish-Iraqi pipeline at Kirkuk.    But Redman said the Iranian push "took place in an area ofIraqi territory which is of little strategic value".    "Actual possession of the area has seesawed between Iraq andIran since the early days of the war," he added.    The Iranian push that captured the territory nearly twoweeks ago and reported in the American press this weekend, wasnot a major offensive, Redman said.    Reuter&#3;
