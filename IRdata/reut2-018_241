The European Community was set toplunge into an ever-deepening budget crisis after ministersfailed to reach agreement on plugging a gap in thenear-bankrupt Community's finances, diplomats said.    As EC budget ministers ended six hours of talks inLuxembourg, diplomats said there was little basis for an accordamongst the trading bloc's 12 member states.    The EC executive Commission says the Community faces adeficit this year of at least five billion European CurrencyUnits and could be forced to choose between massive spendingcuts or bankruptcy.    It has appealed to member states to pay an extra 1.5billion ECUs to help meet the deficit, caused by soaring farmspending and falling revenues.    But hardliners Britain and West Germany have insisted thatthere can be no extra cash for the Community this year andinstead call for a clampdown on farm spending, which absorbstwo thirds of the EC budget.    "We have to make clear that expenses should be based onincome," West German Minister of State Hans Tietmeyer toldreporters.    "There is no way the Germans will agree to extra financingin the form of national contributions," he added.    A second Commission proposal, which would plug most of thebudget gap by paying member states in arrears rather than inadvance for their spending on Community farm policies, was alsofar from agreement, diplomats added.    The proposal, strongly backed by Britain and West Germany,would save up to four billion ECUs if payments were delayed fortwo months.    But poorer member states, which would have to borrow fundsto cover the delay, complain the change in the system wouldunfairly impose too much of the burden on them.    The European Parliament is also expected to refuse an earlydebate on the changeover in the farm payments system, furtherdelaying any moves to solve the deficit problem, parliamentarysources said.
