The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs onJapanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by anagreemement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview.    "But there has to be a clear indication that they arewilling to act," he said.    Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused bythe U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar areproblems "they have brought on themselves."    The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.    "Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economicturmoil in Japan," he said. "My only response is that we havegone through about five years with the dollar going in just theopposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurredfor only a few weeks or months in Japan."    The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, willaffect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tinyfraction of Japan's total exports to the U.S.    Even so, Reagan's decision "doesn't give us any joy. Wedon't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to,"Yeutter said.    Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month inWashington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasonewill include "some difficult items on the agenda."    Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-partsemiconductor agreement, Yeutter said.    Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it hasfailed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and hasfailed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries,undercutting U.S. Products, he said.
