The United States said Kuwait wasdiscussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers totransport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some ofits own vessels under American flags.    State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made thedisclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the UnitedStates expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangementwith Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation inthe Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reaganadministration continued to come under fire in Congress for itsplans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.    The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranianattacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategicwaterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will drawthe United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.    "The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of charteringU.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration," Oakleysaid. She emphasized, however, that "if some charter arrangementcould be worked out, it would not supplant the reflaggingarrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis."    In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navyescort in the Gulf, she said.   The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administratorof the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approachedan American shipping company about the possibility of acharter.    Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representativesof the company, whose identify he did not know, that charteredvessels flying the U.S. flag "would be protected," the newspaperreported.    Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said "we are moving forwardin our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and securitycooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations." Reuter&#3;
