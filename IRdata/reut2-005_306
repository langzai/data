Gold is expected to continue its risethis year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially inthe U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.    It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oilprices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led togrowing inflationary pressures in the U.S.    Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceedcentral bank limits and real growth of their gross nationalproducts, it added.    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increasedindustrial demand and higher expected coin production, the banksaid.    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price onfutures markets, has also risen, the bank said.    These factors and South Africa's unstable politicalsituation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in goldsupplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, itsaid.    However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986. Reuter&#3;
