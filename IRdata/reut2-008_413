The EC Commission will decide shortlyprecisely how to arrange the import of third country maize andsorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with theUnited States, Commission sources said.    Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints aboutthe impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish ECmembership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.    All this produce will be imported into Spain at speciallevy levels likely to be below those applying for imports intoother EC countries.    The sources said it was possible that the Spanishintervention board would be asked to buy the produce directlythis year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.    They added that the choice for future years appears to liebetween a system of regular tenders and the setting of a dailyspecial levy applicable to Spanish imports.    There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize andsorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a taxcould be imposed later, the sources added. Reuter&#3;
