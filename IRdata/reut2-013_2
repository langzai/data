The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself outlate yesterday, killed one miner and trapped 56 othersunderground for about 24 hours. The 56 were eventually broughtsafely out of the mine.    Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation couldtake from a few days to several weeks, but would not be morespecific.    Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans tooperate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metrictons annual finished capacity.
