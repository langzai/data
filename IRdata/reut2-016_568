American Century Corp said ithas restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan lossallowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.    The company said the change came after talks with theSecurities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgementin considering the five mln dlrs collectible.    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, AmericanCentury said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,making its loan loss provision less than required.    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it stillfeels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986was adequate and that it has considered all relevantinformation to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlrreceivable.    But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staffwould not be in its best interest. Reuter&#3;
