Monsanto Corp said a call by theIllinois Environmental Protection Agency requesting theIllinois Attorney General file a lawsuit against the company is"inappropriate and counterproductive."    The company said the suit seeks to force Monsanto toreplace the chlorosulphonic acid cooling system at its WilliamG. Krummrich plant in Sauget, Ill.    Monsanto said the basis for the agency's action was anaccident March Three in which the plant's acid unit experiencedan emission due to a failed expansion joint in the coolingsystem.    Monsanto said when the environmental agency recommendedthat the company replace the present cooling system, itcontacted the manufacturer of the system to seek outsidetechnical advice.    Monsanto said its analysis indicated that the presentsystem represents the safest technology for producingchlorosulfonic acid, and removal of the system with expansionjoints would increase - not decrease - the chances of furtheraccidents.
