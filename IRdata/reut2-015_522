French government ministers will meet nextTuesday to discuss measures to cover the state Social SecurityFund's deficit before the summer, Prime Minister JacquesChirac's social affairs adviser, Marie-Helene Berard, said.    Employment Ministry officials say the fund, in surplusuntil 1985, faces a 24 billion franc deficit by the end of thisyear, largely because of rising unemployment. Budget MinisterAlain Juppe said the fund needed more resources and amanagement overhaul. The government was not in favour ofintroducing an additional tax to fund the deficit as did the previous socialist administration between 1982 and 1985, hesaid. REUTER&#3;
