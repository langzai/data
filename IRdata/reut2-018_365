The proposed European Community (EC) levyon oils and fats has been criticised by CAOBISCO, theassociation of EC biscuit, chocolate and confectionerymanufacturers.    In a letter to the President of the Council of Ministers,M. Eyskens, the association said the tax would cost the ECbiscuit, cake, chocolate and confectionery industries almost200 mln European currency units per year.    The tax also was contrary to the spirit of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and could prompt U.S.Retaliatory measures on EC exports, CAOBISCO said.    In a parallel move the British Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate andConfectionery Alliance has written to U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson urging him to oppose the levy.    President Charles Gillett said the tax was extending theCommission's powers by allowing it to set levels of consumertaxation, an area previously reserved for national treasuries. Reuter&#3;
