Tug crews are preventing the movement offoreign-flag container vessels in and out of the ports ofSydney, Melbourne and Fremantle, shipping sources said.    They said maritime unions imposed bans on late Wednesdayfor reasons that are obscure but seem to be linked with claimsfor a pay rise above the 10 dlrs a week awarded by theArbitration Commission nationally to all workers recently.    Only about 10 vessels are being delayed but the bans willaffect container terminal movements and will disrupt linerschedules, they said.    The dispute goes to the Commission on Monday, they said.
