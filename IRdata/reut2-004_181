Directors of the Chicago MercantileExchange (CME) adjourned a meeting late last night withoutreaching a decision on a petition to ban dual trading inStandard and Poor's 500 stock index futures, an exchangeofficial said.    CME president Bill Brodsky told Reuters that the CME boardwould meet again today and probably reach a decision eitherlate today or tomorrow.    Dual trading involves the right of members to trade fortheir own account as well filling orders for customers.    The petition, signed by several hundred exchange memberswhen it was circulated on the floor of the CME two weeks ago,calls for the elimination of dual trading in the S and P pit.Some industry watchers believe that if the CME eliminates thepractice other exchanges will have to consider such a move.    The practice has drawn criticism from some sectors in thatit provides an opportunity for abusive practices in whichcustomer orders are not executed at the best possible price.    One practice, know as "front-running," involves a brokertrading ahead of a large customer order and then profiting bythe impact on the market of the customer order. Reuter&#3;
