Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reservestotal 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increasedto 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company'sannual report said.    It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquidreserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimatescaused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. Thisaccounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revisionof 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revisionoccurring in the United States, the report said.    Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of itsworldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet lastyear, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased298 billion cubic feet of reserves.    Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of thesegains, the report said.    All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the UnitedStates, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs toacquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.    Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions "will be anintegral part of our strategy, should reserves become availableat attractive prices."    The company said it expects "the marketing climate fornatural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide theopportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demandimprove, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on ourinventory of attractive opportunities."    Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budgetof 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrslast year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985. Reuter&#3;
