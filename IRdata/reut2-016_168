Japanese Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone's unpopular plan to introduce a sales tax caused anelectoral setback for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)in Sunday's local elections, political analysts said.    The LDP retained its 11 prefectural governorships, butfailed to restore a governorship in Fukuoka it had placed muchimportance on winning. In the prefectural assembly elections tofill 2,670 seats, the LDP has so far lost 92 of its previouslyheld 1,487 seats to the socialists and communists.    Full election results should be available later today.    Discussing the election results with reporters, Nakasonesaid, "I wouldn't say the proposed five pct sales tax had noeffect at all, but there were other factors, such as a lowturnout and unusually cold weather."    The Home Affairs Ministry said the average turnout for the13 gubernatorial elections was a record low 59.78 pct while theprefectural assembly polls drew an average of 66.66 pct, also arecord low.    Noboru Goto, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce andIndustry and a longtime friend of Nakasone, told reporters theimpact of the sales tax on the LDP's setback was obvious.    "The government should take action (on the sales tax) inregard to the people's wishes," Goto said.    Nakasone and other LDP leaders have already hinted at adelay in the implementation of the tax, which had beenscheduled for next January, and a possible cut in the rate.    "The most important thing now is to get parliamentaryapproval of the budget as soon as possible to arrest a rapidappreciation of the yen," Nakasone said. "We must implementmeasures to prop up the economy."    Opposition parties said the elections were a referendum onthe tax and they will continue to demand its retraction. REUTER&#3;
