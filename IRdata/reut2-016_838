Damon Corp's Damon ClinicalLaboratories expects to report "significantly better" profitsthis year and a 20 pct gain in sales due in part to increasedtesting for AIDS virus, Damon president Joe Isola said.     Last year the unit earned 8.6 mln dlrs on sales of 97.3mln for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1986. Overall, DamonCorp reported a loss of 2.5 mln dlrs on sales of 148 mln.     Isola attributed the loss to the company's biotechnologysubsidiary.     Damon Labs currently tests about 8,000 samples a night forthe AIDS virus at its Irving, Texas, facility. That's anincrease of about 100 percent from 18 months ago when the U.S.Army chose the company to test for Acquired Immune DeficiencySyndrome among its recruits.     Now, in addition to recruits, the company processesregular Army soldiers undergoing annual physicals, ArmyReserves, the National Guard as well as some Coast Guard andNaval Reserves.     Despite having a capacity for processing 10,000 samples aday, Damon Labs recently decided to move out of its Irvingfacility into a larger one close by and from April 25 on willbe able to process some 16,000 a day.     He said AIDS testing was expected to contribute 18 mlndlrs to sales over the next three to four years, adding thatsome 80 pct of the AIDS testing was military-related.     Despite the enormous number of tests being processed eachday, he said there had never been a mistake. Reuter&#3;
