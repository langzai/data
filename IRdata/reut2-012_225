The french government formally abolishedrules suspended since last September setting limits on theimport and sale of refined oil products from outside theEuropean Community.    The rules, introduced in 1979, required importers to buy atleast 80 pct of their refined products from European refiners,while at least 90 pct of refined products sold in France wererequired to come from French or European refiners.    The abolition of the rules, together with a number ofrelaxations in administrative procedures, was published in theofficial journal today.    French oil industry officials immediately criticised themove as encouraging imports at a time when french refiners aremaking heavy losses.    Industry figures published in February showed industrywidelosses of three billion francs last year after taking intoaccount extraordinary losses on stock depreciation. Reuter&#3;
