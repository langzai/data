Effective extraction of the toxicmetal cadmium from soil may at last be feasible using soybeanplants, research in the Netherlands by a Belgian-basedenvironment group shows.    Cadmium, naturally drawn up by plants and passed on toconsumers, has been shown to produce kidney damage andresulting calcium loss as well as causing high blood pressureand cancers, a spokesman for the Ecological Life andCultivation (VELT) said.    Three years of experiments by the organization showedsoybean plants extracted up to 16 pct of soil-borne cadmium,which went into the leaves and not into the beans themselves.    Cadmium is present in the soil because of emissions in thepast by factories producing non-ferrous metals, the spokesmansaid.    "Although many of these factories are now using far safermethods of manufacture, the cadmium is already in the soil anduntil now there has been no way to get rid of it," he said. Reuter&#3;
