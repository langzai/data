Osman told reporters yesterday the new law opened allsectors of the Somali economy to foreign investment and allowedunrestricted remittance of profits and repatriation of thewhole value of the investment after five years.    The law gives investors guarantees against nationalisationand permits them to retain 50 pct of their export earnings inexternal accounts, a privilege available to Somali exporterssince last year, he added.    Osman described the new terms as very attractive and saidhe expected the bill to go through within a week. Details ofthe previous investment laws were not immediately available.
