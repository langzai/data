Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe United States and the five other industrialized nationssigning the recent Paris Accord remain committed to fosteringthe exchange rate at around current levels.    But he declined to comment on what he believed to be anappropriate level of the dollar in world markets.    "I'm not going to comment on that because invariably theexchange markets read either more or less into my remarks thanI might intend," he said in response to a question from theHouse Appropriations Committee.    Baker said the six nations participating in the Parismeeting in February had "acknowledged that the currencies arewithin ranges that are broadly consistent with the economicfundamentals and we and the others as well remain prepared tocooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates aroundthose levels."
