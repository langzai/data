Cambridge BioScience Corp saidit received Federal Drug Administration approval on its"Investigational New Drug" filing to begin human clinicaltrials of its second generation diagnostic test for AIDS.    The company said it anticipates the test may be released toworldwide markets by late 1987 or early 1988.    Cambridge BioScience also said it expects to file soon an"Investigational New Drug"  with the FDA on its screening testfor detecting AIDS antibodies.    This test, which is being evaluated in emergency situationsin several African nations, does not require highly trainedtechnicians nor instrumentation, according to the company.    Cambridge BioScience explained that the filing for humanclinical trials for AIDS that received FDA approval, utilizesrecombinant-DNA technology to detect and screen antibodies inblood or serum of patients infected with the AIDS-causingvirus.    The other separate planned filing with the FDA is arevolutionary, five-minute latex agglutination screening testfor detecting AIDS antibodies, the company said. This test,utilizes latex beads coated with CBC's recombinant antigenwhich attract and hold AIDS antibodies, forming clusters(agglutination), which indicates a positive result. Reuter&#3;
