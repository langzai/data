Brazil's trade surplus in Marchtotalled 136 mln dlrs, down from 1.13 billion dlrs in the samemonth last year, the official Banco do Brasil announced.    In a news conference, the director of the bank's ForeignTrade Department (Cacex), Roberto Fendt, attributed March's weak performance to labour strikes.    March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53billion dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March1986.    Fendt said coffee earnings were up to 220 mln dlrs in Marchfrom 110 mln dlrs in February, while oil derivatives were downto 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.    He said that although the March results were considerablylower than the same month last year, the government's target ofan eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. TheJanuary-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, below thesame period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.    Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt saidthe trade surplus should reach one billion dlrs in each of thelast six months of the year.    Even though results in the exports of steel, shoes andfrozen concentrated orange juice were weaker compared toFebruary, Fendt said this was not an indication that the UnitedStates was retaliating on account of its dispute with Brazil inthe issue of informatics.    For the next three months, Fendt estimated a monthly tradesurplus of 400 mln dlrs, for an overall surplus of 1.2 billiondlrs in the April-May-June period. Reuter&#3;
