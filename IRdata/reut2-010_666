Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> said it hasreached a series of agreements giving it an indirect majoritystake in the &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG> car parts group.    The takeover is contingent on approval from the FederalCartel Office in West Berlin, a spokesman said, adding thatMannesmann was confident the authorities would not block thepurchase.

The MEC shares willbe bought from the granddaughters of the firm's founder.    Mannesmann is also purchasing a 25.01 pct stake in Fichtelund Sachs from Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> and has an option to buythe bank's remaining 10 pct stake, a company statement said.    In addition to these firm agreements, Mannesmann is alsotalking with the state-owned steel group Salzgitter AG &lt;SALG.H> on buying its 24.98 pct stake in Fichtel und Sachs. This would give Mannesmann around 75 pct of Fichtel und Sachs.    Salzgitter said it decided to give up its own originalplans to seek a majority stake in Sachs after holding talkswith the government in Bonn.    Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might wanta majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it wasseeking to buy only a minority holding in the company, whichhas annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17,000.    The acquisition is part of Mannesmann's efforts todiversify into high-technology areas and away from its previousreliance on steel and pipe-making.
