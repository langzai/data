Senate majority leader Robert Byrdsaid he wants the Senate to pass by late Friday a fiscal 1988budget that starts reducing the flow of U.S. debt.    The Democratic leader told a news conference and later theSenate itself that the Senate would debate the measure todayeven though technically the first procedural vote --on formallybringing up the vital measure for action--would not take placeuntil tomorrow afternoon.    The pending budget would cut some 38 billion dlrs from ananticipated deficit that would occur without any action.    Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole also said he wanted quickaction on the budget measure this week, before Friday afternoonwhen some Republicans want to leave town.    Dole said a Republican substitute probably would be offeredto the Democratic-written budget which would reduce theestimated 1988 deficit of about 171 billion dlrs to about 134billion dlrs, through cuts in defence and social spending andsome 18.5 billion dlrs in unspecified tax hikes in 1988.    The House, also controlled by Democrats, has passed asimilar budget which would have to be reconciled with a Senateplan. President Reagan's budget was defeated in the House. Reuter&#3;
