Brazil will import 30,000 barrelsper day of crude oil from Kuwait, a spokesman for the state oilcompany Petrobras said.    He said that, unlike Saudi Arabia, Kuwait did not imposeany conditions on Brazil.    Last month, Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr oil purchasefrom Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept creditguarantees from the official Bank of Brazil.    The Saudis eventually lifted the condition and Brazildecided to reconfirm the purchase.    Brazil currently consumes 1.1 mln barrels of oil per day. Reuter&#3;
