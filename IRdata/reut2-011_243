The U.S. index of leading indicatorsrose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 pct in February after a revised0.5 pct January fall, the Commerce Department said.    The department previously said the index fell 1.0 pct inJanuary.    The February increase left the index at 187.1 over its 1967base of 100, and was led by a rise in stock prices.    A total of four of nine indicators available for Februarycontributed to the increase in the index.    Besides stock prices, they were manufacturers' new ordersfor consumer goods and materials, average work week andbuilding permits.    Five of nine indicators were negative. They were change insensitive materials prices, money supply, vendor performance,average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance,and contracts and orders for plant and equipment.    The main factor in the January revision was contracts andorders for plant and equipment, the department said.    December also was revised to a 2.4 pct rise from an earlier2.3 pct rise due to a change in outstanding credit.    The index of coincident indicators, which measures thecurrent economy, rose 0.9 pct in February after a decline of1.3 pct in January and a rise of 0.9 pct in December.    The index of lagging indicators, which measures pasteconomic activity, decreased 0.3 pct in February afterincreasing 1.7 pct in January and falling by 0.5 pct inDecember.    The department said it has suspended net business formationfrom the leading indicators index because it has deterioratedas a measure of change in the business population. Reuter&#3;
