Japanese shipbuilders have applied to thestate's Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restricttonnage built to about half of total capacity for the yearstarting April 1, officials of the Shipbuilders Association ofJapan said.    Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of morethan 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mlncompensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year againstcapacity of about six mln CGRT.    The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRTin the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.    The industry has curtailed production due to oversupplynearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or TransportMinistry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceilingof four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.    The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are notlegally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest tostick to them.    The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yenand a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump. REUTER&#3;
