The Independent Federation of FlightAttendants said U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs entered atemporary restraining order prohibiting Trans World AirlinesInc from refusing to recognize and deal with the union.    The union said the order also prohibits TWA from denyingunion representatives access to the company's property.    The union said the Kansas City judge acted on itscomplaints made seeking to enforce a recent U.S. Court ofAppreals decision reinstating contractural provisions whichexisted at the time of the 70-day strike which ended in May1986.    The flight attendants union said it petitioned the districtcourt because of TWA's ongoing refusal to allow unionrepresentatives on the airline's property.    The union said the court order also requires TWA to postnotices of a temporary restraining order throughout its systemand to districute copies of the order to all itsflight-attendant employees.    The union said the order requires the airline to appear inU.S. District Court in Kansas City March 20 to show cause why apreliminary injunction should not be granted. Reuter&#3;
