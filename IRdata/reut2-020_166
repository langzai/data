Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd inAugust, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output atseveral of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production atfields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk fieldrescue project.    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway'svoluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oiloutput, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabiliseoil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend theproduction restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on allits North Sea fields for the rest of the year.    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norwaywould extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, whichpumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which usethe Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August whilePhillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ulafield, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after droppingto 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpdlast month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the companysaid.    September production was also sharply higher at theStatfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, whichextends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpdagainst 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske StatsOljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, likeStatfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpdin September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previousmonth, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpdin September, compared with 100,188 in August.    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said testoutput at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarltotalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd inAugust.    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring onstream a second well, cutting September production to just twodays. REUTER&#3;
