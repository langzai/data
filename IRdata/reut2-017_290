Treasury Secretary James Baker hascancelled a trip to Australia because of pressing business athome, including the visit this week by Japanese Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, a Treasury spokesman said.    The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said: "Iwould not draw any conclusion from the cancellation...I wouldjust say it's the press of business."    But he added that the visit by the Japanese leader was "partof the press of business."    The spokesman denied the cancellation was linked to thecurrent turmoil in the financial markets.       Nakasone's visit is expected to be crucial for the currencymarkets. Unless the Japanese prime minister brings with himmeasures to stimulate the Japanese economy by fiscal expansionor lower interest rates, the visit is likely to be consideredby currency markets as an outright failure.    In addition, it is thought highly unlikely that Nakasoneand Reagan will agree on the removal of U.S. trade sanctionsimposed earlier this month on certain electronic goods.    But the participation in the talks by Baker, theadministration's top policy maker on international economicaffairs, suggests that hard bargaining between the two sidesmay be in prospect.       Asked if the trip by Baker, who was to have left April 30and returned May 6, had been dropped in the last couple ofdays, the Treasury spokesman replied: "I would think so."    He described the trip as "purely ceremonial."    Both Japan and the United States have a lot to lose from anunsuccessful outcome to the this week's talks.    Tokyo and Washington are aware that nervous currency markets stand ready to bail out of dollars and buy yen, whicheconomists fear could send world interest rates soaring andeven lead to global recession.    Baker has been the driving force behind theadministration's efforts to coordinate international economicpolicies and reduce global trade imbalances.    Reuter&#3;
