Canadian seafarers are almost certainto go on strike this spring in a refusal to meet rollbacks inwages and benefits asked for by their employers, Seafarers'International Union official Roman Gralewicz said.    "It's 99.9 percent--I guarantee you a strike," Gralewiczsaid in an interview.    The union represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakesand Canada's East and West coasts. Contract talks broke off inJanuary and a conciliator has been appointed to try to helpsettle the dispute. The current contract expires at the end ofMarch.    The seafarers' employers are also asking for a reduction increw levels, a move which the union said would cost about 400jobs. Reuter&#3;
