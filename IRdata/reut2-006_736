The 25-nation Latin American EconomicSystem (SELA) has presented a document calling for a newstrategy to cope with Latin America's crushing debt andfaltering growth.    SELA presented the document to a week-long conference oflatin american financial and economic experts, meeting to laythe groundwork for this year's annual meeting of the unitednations conference on trade and development (unctad).    SELA called for new efforts to break "the vicious circle ofdebt, stagnation and productive retrogression the region hasbeen immersed in since the beginning of the decade."    The alterantives to existing approaches for dealing withthe region's crushing foreign debt must include greaterconcessions from creditors, according to sela.    Radical concessions such as debt writedowns and schemes totie payments to real income must all be considered, the seladocument stresses.    It notes that other favorable strategies include foreigninvestment/debt equity swaps, already successfully experimentedwith in some countries.    Other policies recommended include more realistic exhangerates and more producive capital investment programs.    The sela document is expected to be approved by delegatesfrom all 26 latin american and caribbean nations meeting hereuntil friday.    It will be submitted again for approval by developingnations belonging to the so-called group of 77 scheduled tomeet next month in havana, cuba.    At the havana meeting delegates from latin america, asiaand africa will attempt to hammer out a common position forpresentation at unctad's annal meeting next july in geneva. Reuter&#3;
