Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    "There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root."    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    "In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen," he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land. REUTER&#3;
