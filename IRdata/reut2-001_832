President Reagan said improperrecord keeping of meetings and decisions made on the Iran armsinitiative led to his failure to recollect whether he approvedarms shipments by Israel before or after the fact.    In a televised address to the American people Reagan saidhe is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- acomplaint made by the Tower commission.    The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel.    "I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when,"Reagan said.    Reagan added: "Rest assured, there's plenty ofrecord-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (theWhite House)."    The timing of Reagan's approval of the Israeli shipment isimportant because it could determine whether the sale violatedvarious laws, including the Arms Export Control Act. Reuter&#3;
