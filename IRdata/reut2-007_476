Belgrade trade union leaders havejoined attacks on a controversial wage freeze in Yugoslavia andreported strikes spreading to the capital.    Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unionscouncil, said the government must take responsibility for theeffects of the law imposing the wage freeze.    Under the law, which was enacted on February 27 and willremain in force until July 1, wage levels of the last quarterof 1986 were reimposed and future pay rises were pegged toproductivity. The move has caused resentment and widespreadindustrial unrest throughout the country.    Another Belgrade trade union council leader, PredragPetrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been onstrike in Belgrade.    Yugoslav trade unions are an integral part of the communistpolitical system and their role has traditionally not been todefend workers from the government. The criticisms by theBelgrade union leaders indicated wider trade union resentmentof the law than earlier reported.    The government has officially reported 70 strikesthroughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers haveindicated there have been more. REUTER&#3;
