Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Alial-Khalifa al-Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oiloutput ceiling and this would help prices move higher,according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview.    The al-Rai al-Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC waspumping 2.4 mln barrels per day (bpd) less than its 15.8 mlnbpd ceiling, while consumers were drawing down their petroleumstocks at a rate of 4.5 mln bpd.    As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs, demand for itsoil will rise in April and May, Sheikh Ali said, adding thatKuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota. REUTER&#3;
