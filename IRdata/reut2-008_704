U.S. Department of Energy SecretaryJohn Herrington said he was "optimistic" about the chances ofproviding a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gasproducers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition fromsome members of the Reagan administration.    Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at abreakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan fora 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was "heavy and strong"largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry couldeventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as theagriculture industry.    Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industrywere issued last week after the Department of Energy released acomprehensive report finding U.S. national security could bejeopardized by rising oil imports.    In response to a question from Mitchell Energy andDevelopment Corp &lt;MND> chairman, George Mitchell, Herringtonsaid the report did not definitively rule out an oil importtarrif. "We intend to keep that debate open," Herrington said.    However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters thatthe new report shows an oil import fee "is not economical."    Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff onoil imports would cause the nation's gross national product todrop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.    Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, whorequested the comprehensive national security study, wascommitted to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.    "I'm quite confident he understands the problems and isprepared to do something about it," Herrington said. Reuter&#3;
