In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile PacificShipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial andengineering conditions before the contract is awarded.    The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mlndlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for theconstruction of the vessel.said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will berequired to offer assurances that the shipyard is technicallyand financially capable of performing the work."    Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower thancompeting bidders and will generate 1,000 person years ofdirect employment.    Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the mostpowerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year andcompleted in 1992.    The government announced plans to build the icebreaker lastyear following the controversial passage of the U.S. CoastGuard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed NorthwestPassage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for thejourney, claiming the area was an international water way.    The government said the icebreaker was needed to back upthe country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic. Reuter&#3;
