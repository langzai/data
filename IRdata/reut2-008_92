The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Banksaid it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country'sminimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profitsfrom its operations in the country.    Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to complywith the new capital requirement -- raised from three mlndinars -- by the start of 1986.    Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi toldReuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higherlevel but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. Thebank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.    Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the highercapital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decidedinstead to close its operation, banking sources said.    Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, whilethe branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.    Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made anexception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply.They said the gesture refelcted close political ties betweenJordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties.    The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars. REUTER&#3;
