Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman AkioMorita played down the U.S.-Japanese trade conflict, sayingthat direct investment abroad was the most effective way toreduce Japan's trade surplus.    Morita was speaking at the official opening of a 100million franc (16.4 million dollars) compact disc playerfactory in eastern France.    He said trade friction between the U.S. And Japan overhigh-technology was a very complicated and delicate issue butthat Sony intended to invest directly throughout the world.    Referring to the European Community's stance againstturnkey plants, he said: "I know Brussels is not very favourableto these so-called new Japanese 'screwdriver factories', but inSony's case our policy is quite different."    The Colmar plant, Sony's third in France, would eventuallyuse local components and be a purely French factory, he said.     Sony France SA was established in 1973. Its 1986 saleswere two billion francs (327 mln dlrs) and the company says itexpects sales of 2.7 billion francs (443 mln dlrs) in 1987.Sony's other two French plants, in the south west of thecountry, export over 80 per cent of their production.    Company officials say that production from Sony's Europeanfactories currently accounts for over 30 per cent of thegroup's European sales and they expect this to increase. In1986 over 20 per cent of Sony's eight billion dollar worldwidesales were made in Europe.    At the beginning of 1987, Sony employed about 1,100 peoplein Europe. The group plans to open a compact disc softwarefactory in Austria this summer and an audio cassette plant inItaly next year. Reuter&#3;
