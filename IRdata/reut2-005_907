Treasury Secretary James Baker,while defending the progress of his 1985 debt initiative,conceded that lending by commercial banks to developingcountries has not gone as fast as the administration would haveliked.    In testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee,Baker said, however, "I think it is wrong to say that(commercial bank lending) has not occured in a meaningful way."    He added though that it has not "materialized as fast as wewould have liked."    The Treasury secretary also said that it would bepolitically wrong for the United States or other countries toguarantee loans made by commercial banks to the developingcountry debtors because that would be "rightly perceived as abank bailout."    Baker also said that it would be impractical forgovernments to mandate bank lending to the third world sincethis would have the eventual impact of turning commercial banksaway from making all loans to the region.
