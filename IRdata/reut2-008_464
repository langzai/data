A federal judge and a former U.S.senator are among the top contenders to replace John Shad aschairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), government sources said.    Also on the list of possible replacements are two currentSEC commissioners, said the sources who asked not to be named.    Last week the White House said it would name Shad U.S.ambassador to the Netherlands. Among those most frequentlyplaced on the short list of Shad's possible successors wereKevin Duffy, a New York federal judge, and Nicholas Brady, whoserved about eight months in the Senate in 1981.    Brady, currently a managing partner with the New Yorkinvestment banking firm of Dillon, Read and Co Inc, was aninterim replacement for Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) afterWilliams resigned in a congressional bribery scandal. Duffy wasSEC New York regional administrator during 1969-72.    However, congressional sources speculated Brady may beunwilling to take the SEC post because he is active in VicePresident George Bush's presidential campaign.    The SEC commissioners said to be possible replacements forShad are Charles Cox and Edward Fleischman.    Fleischman was a New York securities lawyer before his SECappointment while Cox was the commission's chief economist.    Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat whose SenateBanking Committee would hold confirmation hearings on the newchairman, said he hoped that Shad's successor "would be verysupportive of the division of enforcement's on-goinginvestigation of the scandals on Wall Street and would besomeone who did not come directly from the industry."    The White House said on Friday it would nominate Shad, 63,to succeed L. Paul Bremer as the U.S. ambassador to theNetherlands. Reuter&#3;
