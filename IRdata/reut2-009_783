U.S. Treasury Assistant SecretaryDavid Mulford said he foresaw substantial net new commercialloans to the major debtor countries in 1987.    In testimony before a Senate banking subcommittee, Mulfordsaid he based this prediction on progress in talks betweenbanks and Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela, as well as progress innegotiations with the Philippines.    "These agreements, together with others for Argentina andwe hope Brazil," should assure substantial new loans this year,Mulford said.    Mulford defended the U.S. strategy for handling the debtcrisis and added additional steps, like development bycommercial banks of a menu of options to support debtor reform,can be undertaken.    That particular development would maintain broad bankparticipation in new financing packages to debtors.    Mulford stessed that greater flexibility in devising newmoney packages may be essential for future bank syndications.    "The commercial banks have much to gain from taking thelead themselves to develop the kinds of ideas that help assurethe concerted lending process works," he said.    In particular, Mulford said banks and debtor nations willincreasingly move toward repricing, retiming or reschedulingagreements as an alternative to new loans.    "The benefits of such approaches may be substantial andmay, in the right circumstances, be easier to achieve than newmoney packages," he said.    But for debtors with substantial financing needs, newlending will still be necessary, he said.    Mulford rejected congressional ideas for a debt facility asbeing far too costly to creditor governments, and ultimatelytaxpayers.    Mulford urged further development of debt-equity swaps aswell as broader mutual funds for conversion into equity.    As in the past, Mulford said progress must be founded oneconomic reforms and sufficient new financing for debtors bothto support those reforms and generate new growth. Reuter&#3;
