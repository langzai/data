House Speaker Jim Wright is lobbyingcongressmen to support a plan to cut the 1988 budget deficitabout 40 billion dlrs, half through spending cuts and theremainder through tax hikes, congressional sources said.    He is backing a half and half plan and has made thesuggestion to Democrats on the House Budget Committeeprivately, committee sources said.    However, a committee source told Reuters that committeeDemocrats already generally favor a plan to cut the deficitabout 40 billion dlrs, half through taxes and the Speaker'smove was seen as building support outside the committee.    Wright's 20 billion dlr revenue raising plan has nospecifics, although he has floated a stock transfer tax andalso has suggested deferring tax cuts due to the wealthy.    Neither of those plans has caught fire yet in Congress, andsome congressmen are cool to the idea of a stock tax.    The Budget committee is considering a 1988 budget aimed atreducing the estimated deficit of 170 billion dlrs as estimatedby the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.    Committee Chairman William Gray has publicly backed abudget cutting move of 40 billion dlrs but says that will notreach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for 1988 of 108 billiondlrs, although he claims it will be in the spirit of it.
