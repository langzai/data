Iran's top war spokesman Ali AkbarHashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two ofits Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.    "God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming daysand make them sorry," said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliamentlater broadcast by Tehran Radio.    The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeanceafter the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.    President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousaviand now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have allvowed retaliation.    Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "It is not athreat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we willrespond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved itin practice." He added that the American attack "squares neitherwith its superpower image nor its claim of concern withsecurity, nor reason and wisdom."    U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform andAmerican special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.    The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured responseto an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaititanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday. REUTER&#3;
