Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging toinvestment and that a better course would be to restrainspending.    "A restrictive monetary policy would hit investment. Youdon't want to put interest rates up unless you have to," Volckertold the Senate Banking Committee.    "That is not a constructive way to proceed," he said.    Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing thebudget deficit or squeezing investment, he would favorsqueezing the budget deficit.    In response to a question about banks, Volcker said hewould be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a taxwriteoff as an incentive for them to take greater reservesagainst loans to debtor countries.    "If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans,then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy,"Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc). Reuter&#3;
