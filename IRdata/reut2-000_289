Mine and industry officials frommost member states of the Association of Tin ProducingCountries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit groupexports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, accordingto views polled by Reuter correspondents.    The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed atcutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now andboosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.    Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC accountfor some 65 pct of the world's tin output.    Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an exportquota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000,Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.    Australia has said it is not setting any export quota.However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughlyequal to its expected output this year.    Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.    Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer,said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure thatoutput is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year startedMarch 1.    Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters thatexcess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 inthe one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.    Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curband asked the government not to issue new mining licences. Morethan 100 applications for licences are pending.    Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mininglicences only if a six-month review of production trends showedthat local mines were not overproducing.    ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy MinisterSubroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.    A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PTTambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia tostick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this wasclose to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.    In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu saidThailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added thiswould not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.    To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tinexporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encouragebigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would bepermitted, he said.    The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected todisallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessiveproduction, industry sources said.    But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong toldReuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo,Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.    Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in1985, Pramual said.    Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year thanits allocated 13,761 tonne quota.    Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Pazthat Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin incalendar 1987.    He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis ofOctober 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the statemining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct ofBolivia's total exports.    He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exportsbut added he was confident the goals set by the plan would beachieved. He did not elaborate.    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said inLagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within itsATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output haddeclined due to poor demand and high production costs.    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output wasless than 1,000 tonnes last year.    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries'export figures every three months using customs documents andmake projections from such data to see if quotas were likely tobe breached within the year-long quota period.    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely tobreach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfiltheir quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to othermembers at the ATPC's discretion.    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate withthe ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnesrespectively during the quota period. REUTER&#3;
