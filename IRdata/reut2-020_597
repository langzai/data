The United States may lift anadditional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan laterthis month, Reagan Administration officials said.    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions onJapanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and thirdcountry markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct onJapanese color television sets, hand-held power tools andportable computers.    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  afterJapan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market atbelow production costs.    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memoryand recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.    The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of thesemiconductors in third countries, where they had been takingsales away from American-made semiconductors.    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions wouldbe lifted by the end of the month.    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening theclosed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliancewith the agreement earlier this week.    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remainingsanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan isin full compliance with the semiconductor agreement. reuter&#3;
