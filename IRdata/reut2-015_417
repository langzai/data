Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmedtheir Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince themarket of their resolve.    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawasaid the ministers and central bank governors did not believe atotally new statement was needed.    The speculative selling did not reflect economicfundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only areaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, hesaid.    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve hadconcentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially themark, had remained stable.    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since theParis accord was not worth being called fundamental.    "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expressionof 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within therange agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointinga level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,Miyazawa said.    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in thestatement, he said Japan was exceptional among the sevenbecause the yen appreciated against the dollar while othermajor currencies largely have been stable.    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party hasjusted adoped a package to reflate the economy while othernations are not supposed to produce new measures in a shortperiod since the Paris agreement.    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanesesemiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7meeting and did not affect the currency talks.    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developingcountries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiativeoutlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago. REUTER&#3;
