Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of therefining and marketing company that is to spin off from DiamondShamrock Corp told Reuters that the new company will have adebt to equity ratio of 60/40.    Hemminghaus said cash flow between 80 and 120 mln dlrs peryear will reverse the ratio to 40/60 within two years.    He said the spinoff, to be called Diamond Shamrock R and MInc, will probably occur just before the annual meeting of Diamond Shamrock Corp. The annual meeting is scheduled forApril 30 in Dallas, he said. Hemminghaus was in San Antonio forthe National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.    An effort by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens to take overDiamond Shamrock was a reason behind the company's decision tospinoff, although a spinoff may have occurred anyway,Hemminghaus said.    He said that investment advisors told the company Pickens'offer was inadequate and suggested the company split up into apure exploration and production upstream operation and a pureplay downstream refining and marketing company.    He said he is hopes to raise 400 mln dlrs in financing forthe new company.    Hemminghaus said 65 to 75 pct of the new company's earningswill come from wholesale refining, 20 to 30 pct will come fromthe retail sale of gasoline and other items at gasolineconvenience store locations, and five to 10 pct from naturalgas liquids and storage and marketing.    "Growth will be defined in building retail volumes, jobbervolumes and refining capacity after that," Hemminghaus toldReuters. He said the new company will have a capital spendingbudget of 35 to 55 mln dlrs a year.    Reuter&#3;
