A world recession is unlikely thisyear as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrializedcountries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said.    But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told anews conference.    Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption wouldsupport economic growth in West Germany this year, with netincome increases turning into purchasing power as long asinflation did not revive.    Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise inWest Germany this year, but there was little room for furtherfalls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced bythe latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate.    Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing ofthe U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months.    One success of the Paris agreement in February to fostercurrency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talkingdown the dollar, he noted.    The recent stability would last until markets decided totest the resolve of central banks, he said.    He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrsthis week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the firstsuch test.    "A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we getbad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higherintervention amount, raising the danger of inflation," he said.    Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen saidBrazil's unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks.    But the move showed that a real solution to debt problemswas only possible with the involvement of all parties. Reuter&#3;
