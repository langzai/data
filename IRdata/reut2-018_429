Indonesia will try to increase sugaroutput in calendar 1988 to 2.4 mln tonnes from an expected 2.2mln in 1987, Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said.    He told reporters after meeting President Suharto the gainswill come from increasing average production to 10 tonnes perhectare from the previous 6.2 tonnes.    He said Indonesia is aiming to pass the United States tobecome the world's fourth largest producer compared with itscurrent seventh position.    Affandi said the increase would insure Indonesia'sself-sufficiency in the commodity and allow it to keep adequatestocks.    Indonesia said it produced 2.02 mln tonnes in 1986, but theU.S. Embassy in its annual agriculture report said output was1.8 mln tonnes. The U.S. Report forecast no change for 1987.    Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar late last yearand in early 1987 to boost low sugar stocks.    The country has around 284,000 hectares of sugar canefarms. The agriculture ministry estimates domestic consumptionat 2.03 mln tonnes in calendar 1987. REUTER&#3;
