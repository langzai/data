Boeing Co. &lt;BA> is trying to find outwhat caused an engine brace to snap on one of Japan Air Line's747-SR jumbo jets, a spokesman for the airplane manufacturersaid.    "We know about the problem and we have provided a serviceadvisory to operators of 747s," said the spokesman. "We are notadvising any massive inspections at this time."    The advisory alerts operators of the jumbo jets that aproblem has occurred and under what circumstances, but it doesnot recommend any action.    "A 'service bulletin' would be sent out if there isanything they should be concerned about," the spokesman said.    A JAL spokesman in Toyko said inspectors making a routinecheck found one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine tothe wing of a 747-SR had snapped due to metal fatigue.    The airlines said it had ordered an inspection of all 11 ofits 747-SR's. The plane is a full-sized jumbo jet that has beenmodified slightly to handle short-haul routes in Japan, mainlybetween Tokyo and Osaka.    The jetliners have beefed-up landing gear to accommodate ahigher-than-normal number of landings and takeoffs.    Boeing's spokesman said only JAL and All Nippon Airlinesuse the 747-SR. JAL took delivery of its first 747-SR in 1973and purchased two more last year. He said the braces had beenshipped to a Boeing plant near Seattle where they were beinginspected. Reuter&#3;
