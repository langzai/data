Finance Minister Roger Douglas saidthe fall in share prices on local and world marketsdemonstrated that New Zealand could not be isolated from globaltrends.    "We can't expect to isolate ourselves from developmentsaround the world," Douglas told reporters.    "I think above all what today's problems illustrate is thatthe sort of policies that we have been putting in place thelast three years are absolutely essential so that New Zealand'seconomic performance improves, relative to the rest of theworld."    The New Zealand share market fell 14.7 pct on Tuesday in arecord one-day fall.    Douglas told a news conference, at which the governmentannounced plans to sell its 89 pct stake in &lt;New Zealand SteelLtd>, that the sharemarket fall would not affect plans to sellparts of state-owned corporations such as &lt;Air New Zealand>,&lt;DFC New Zealand Ltd> and &lt;Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd>.Asked if the government considered acting to close thesharemarket for a period, Douglas said: "No. I'm not sure itwould have been my job to do so."
