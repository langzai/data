A Colombia government trade official hasurged the business community to aggressively diversify itsactivities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.    Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign TradeInstitute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not becomewhat he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionallyColombia's major export.    The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, orabout 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making upanother third and non-traditional exports the remainder.
