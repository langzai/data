Thomas Berger, Deputy AssistantSecretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in theexchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up andtrigger inflation.    He told a meeting of the President's Export Council thatthe Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins toreflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remainedmuch the same.    But he added that if the dollar dropped further there couldbe inflation in the United States.    Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may causeeconomic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and thatwould not be in America's interest because it would close thosemarkets to U.S. goods.
