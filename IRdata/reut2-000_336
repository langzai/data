The U.S. economy continued to expand inFebruary, but at a slower pace than in January which saw aspurt of activity, the National Association of PurchasingManagement (NAPM) said in a report.    The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It wasthe seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicatorwas over 50 pct.    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economyis in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a decliningeconomy.    The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managersat 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growthrate in new orders and production slowed in February.    However, production remained vigorous as more than threetimes as many members reported it better rather than worse.    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but membersreported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel &lt;X>gradually resumed production.    An equal number of members reported inventories were higherand lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August1984.    For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higherrather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business surveycommittee and director of materials management at Pitney BowesInc &lt;PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February,but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of neworders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects fora respectable first quarter."    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, basedon five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. Reuter&#3;
