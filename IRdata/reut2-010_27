The United Auto Workers struckGeneral Motors Corp's truck and bus plants at Pontiac, Mich,General Motors said.    General Motors' truck and bus group failed to reach anagreement on local issues with UAW Local 594 by the union'sdeadline of noon today, causing a strike by 9,000 hourlyworkers at the facility, the company said.    General Motors said it was "eager" to continue meeting withunion officials on the dispute. It was not immediately clearwhether contract talks were continuing at the facility.    General Motors spokesman Frank Cronin said the three plantsat Pontiac stopped working "as of noon today."    He said talks will resume Friday at 1000 EST in Pontiac."We're hoping (the strike) will be of very brief duration,"Cronin said.    Bus-manufacturing operations at one of the threeplants--the Pontiac Central facility--are being sold toGreyhound Corp &lt;G>, although GM will retain the facility.    Cronin said about 400 workers on the bus line will be laidoff "whenever we fulfill production commitments" on the buses,"possibly in May."    The Pontiac Central plant also makes medium- and heavy-dutytrucks. Assembly of the medium trucks is scheduled to move toJanesville, Wis., in 1990, Chronin said.    Heavy truck operations at the plant will be taken over byGM's joint venture with Volvo AB, and all vehicle assemblyoperations at the facility will eventually be ended, Chroninsaid. The plant also has sheet metal operations, which are sofar unaffected, he said.    The other two plants at Pontiac--Pontiac East and PontiacWest--make full-size pickups and sport utility vehicles.
