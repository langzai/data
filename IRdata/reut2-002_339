Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., hasintroduced a bill to create an international debt adjustmentfacility to deal with third world debt.    He said in a statement the facility would purchase debt ofa debtor nation at a discount and then sell the loans toprivate investors. LaFalce said the facility could use funds ofthe World Bank and International Monetary Fund as collateral tofor the necessary financial banking to issue debt instruments.    LaFalce, a member of the House Banking Committee, said thefacility was needed because most American banks were refusingto fund more foreign debt and debtor countries were havingtrouble paying the loans on schedule.
