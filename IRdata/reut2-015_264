Vulcan Corp's first quarter operatingresults will show a loss, Chairman Lloyd I. Miller told toldthe annual meeting.    The company reported a profit of 365,883 dlrs, 23 cts ashare, for the first quarter last year with one cent a sharecoming from non-operating factors, a spokesman said.    Miller attributed the expected loss to completion of thepurchase transfer and consolidation of operating assets of theO'Sullivan Rubber Division, saying this was proving more costlyand taking more time than originally anticipated.    Vulcan is working to resolve the problems, Miller toldshareholders, adding it appears it will take most of 1987 tofind solutions.    Reuter&#3;
