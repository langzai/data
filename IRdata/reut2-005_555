The International Cocoa Organization,ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer andconsumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine adraft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow,delegates said.    ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up whatsome delegates called a "pre-compromise" and present it to thebuffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said.    While consumer and producer member nations disagree how abuffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated theywere willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said.    "I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement --maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in thesession," a consumer delegate said.    Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only ofICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of variousgrade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades,delegates said.    Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager beable to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price forthe buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin.    Consumer members were not unified in their views on how thebuffer stock should operate, with several countries backingdifferent aspects of the producer stance, delegates said.    The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run untilMarch 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the mostcontroversial topic on the agenda, delegates said. Reuter&#3;
