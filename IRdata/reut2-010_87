Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia'scoffee growers' federation, said he did not believe anyimportant decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting ofthe International Coffee Organization (ICO).    The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March31 and could decide to call a special council session by theend of April to discuss export quotas.    "It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what hasbeen happening in the market, but it's unlikely any majordecisions are taken," Cardenas told journalists.    Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce exportquotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure.    Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking toreporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committeemeeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United Stateswere too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.    Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazilwould not change its coffee policies.    Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearerbecause the trade knew the projected output and stockpilelevels of producers.    He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfallof nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October,the start of the coffee year, and February. Reuter&#3;
