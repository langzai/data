Employers in Rotterdam's troubledgeneral cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancyprocedures within a week, employers' organisation labourrelations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters.    Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said theemployers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumptionof eight weeks of strikes in the sector.    The strike action was called off on Friday after an interimcourt injunction against the employers' plans for 350redundancies this year.    A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had madean error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permissionfor the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until afinal ruling on May 7.    Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might welltake up to two months, but the employers were not preparedsimply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with thechance they would have to start all over again in any case.    "We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. Thestrikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business,and further delays would do even more damage," Zeebregts said.    The campaign of lightning strikes in the port's generalcargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' plansfor 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 strong workforceby 1990, starting with 350 this year.
