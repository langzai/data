Paul O'Kelly, currently assistant regional administrator ofthe Securities and Exchange Commission, was namedvice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said.    The expanded compliance program, which calls for anincrease in the exchange's compliance budget and addition ofstaff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CME'scurrent surveillance was not able to keep up with increaseddemands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said.    The new surveillance program calls for the addition ofthree floor investigators and five compliance investigators,the CME said.    Some of the new staff will monitor the exchange's newComputerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to startJuly 1.    In addition, three computer programmers will be added toassist in regulatory support for the exchange's managementinformation system department.

In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner andExecutive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members toreject the referendum in favor a series of new rules.    Included in the rule changes was the requirement thatfutures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personaltrades to the nearest minute, intended to "enhance theeffectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions,"    "We made a promise to our members that we have kept,"Melamed said in a release today.    He said the new surveillance program "represents acommitment to a vigorous enforcement policy." Reuter&#3;
