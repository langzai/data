The "cross field allowance" relief onPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRTpaying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.    The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct ofqualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability ofother fields. It is restricted to new offshore developmentsoutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field notpaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directlybenefit in PRT saving on an existing field.    "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participatorsin those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said,adding that the timing of development of such fields may beadvanced.    The government would in effect be subsidising thesedevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure beforecorporation tax, the report said.    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit isof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields willbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields willrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.    In a study on probable fields, the report said that whenthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-payingfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in theU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for asmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9pct.    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there willbe a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not onlywill these costs be unavailable for offset against the field'sfuture profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs willbe lost.    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development startswill have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a latertime. Reuter&#3;
