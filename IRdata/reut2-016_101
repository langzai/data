The United Auto Workers union (UAW)vowed to fight wage and job cuts in a round of labour talksstarting in July that cover nearly 500,000 workers at GeneralMotors Corp &lt;GM> and Ford Motor Co &lt;F>.    "The UAW doesn't go around picking fights, but we don't runaway from them when they're forced on us ... We want peace, butpeace comes at a price," union president Owen Bieber said.    "And if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it," he said, inan address to 3,000 union leaders at the start of a four-dayspecial convention.    He said the Detroit carmakers had turned their backs onAmerica by the increasing use of imports that cost U.S. Jobs.    He said the union was ready to strike for "job and incomeguarantees," bans on shifting production to foreign and othernon-union sources, and increases in pay and profit-sharing.    GM, under pressure from declining sales and profits, hassaid this year's talks will be difficult because it wants tolimit wage rises and shed parts-manufacturing operationsconsidered uncompetitive.    Contracts at both companies expire at midnight on September14. REUTER&#3;
