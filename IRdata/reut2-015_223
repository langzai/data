Robert Heller, a member of theFederal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" ofgrowth in the money supply this year.    "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also amost desireable development," he said in a speech prepared fordelivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,Calif.    A text was released in Washington.    He said the effect of lower inflation and financialderegulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.    "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modestlevels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowedafter mid-January.    "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregateswere to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year aswell," he added.    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.    "The pricing behavior of American producers in response toprice increases of their foreign competitors will be crucialfor our economic future," he said.    Widespread domestic price rises in response to risingimport prices would "generalize the inflationary forcesemanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain moremarket share for U.S. producers.    "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well bethe result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.    He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to bedisciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."     Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscaldiscipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint ratherthan new taxes.    "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindleinflation and certainly would not make us more competitive ininternational markets," Heller said.    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pctduring 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated withCanada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing Americanproducers to compete more effectively in that country," Hellersaid. Reuter&#3;
