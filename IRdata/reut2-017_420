Bangladesh is keeping its options open onwhether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of theUnited States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract,but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of thecargo, a senior Food Ministry official said.    The official, who declined to be named, said the companyunder a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only126,000 tonnes altogether.    The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrsper tonne for every delayed day according to a document signedby both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, hetold Reuters.    "If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view,"the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at acabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added.    A pro-government Bengali daily "Dainik Janata" reported todaythat Continental Grain could face a penalty of 200 mln taka(6.49 mln dlrs) for alleged failure to maintain shipmentschedule.    The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi AhmedChoudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh governmentfor an extension of the shipment period because loading ofwheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and afaulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yetgranted the extension, he said.    Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had goneup after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financialloss to the company.    He said he was not "officially informed" of the move toimpose a penalty, although he was "not totally unaware of it."    Continental Grain officials in New York declined tocomment. Reuter&#3;
