Trans World Airlines Inc said it filedsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and itsboard of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill"anti-takeover plan.    TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein saidTWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no wayinterfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc&lt;PIE>.    Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin theenforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poisonpill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue ofsecurities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeoverbid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them moreexpensive.    USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bidwas an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.    USAir also had said its counsel would investigate thematter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had nocomment on TWA's lawsuit.    USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to theDepartment of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pctof USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pendingapproval of a takeover.    USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together inorder to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that wouldallow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions thatwould be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large."    USAir called on the transportation department to rejectTWA's request. Reuter&#3;
