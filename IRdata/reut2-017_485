The U.S. Department of Agriculture'sforecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks willalmost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not besurprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'Association and the National Union of Agricultural and CerealCooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports orend-of-season stocks.    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaignwill be released at the beginning of September, an ONICofficial said.    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult toestimate at this stage, both within the European Community andto non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.    He said, however, that among countries to which Francecould increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghrebcountries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,was not out of line with estimates of the French MaizeProducers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields wereexpected to be higher, the AGPM official said.    It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87. Reuter&#3;
