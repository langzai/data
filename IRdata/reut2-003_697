Mitchell Energy andDevelopment Corp said it plans to hold its capital spending infiscal 1988, ending January 31, to 96 mln dlrs, down from the123 mln dlrs spent in 1987 and 213 mln dlrs in 1986.    The company also said its natural gas revenues so far thisyear have been reduced by lower contract customer purchases dueto mild weather and soft economic conditions.    "But the contracts call for the lower 'takes' to be made upduring the course of the year," Mitchell Energy said. Meanwhileit will sell additional quantities of gas on the spot market.    Mitchell Energy said the additional spot sales will tend tolower the average price realized for gas in the early part offiscal 1988.    However, it said the average for the full year is notexpected to be significantly lower than the 2.99 dlrs perthousand cubic feet averaged in fiscal 1987.                       Reuter&#3;
