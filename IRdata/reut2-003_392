New Zealand's total foreign debtwill continue to decline as major energy projects arerefinanced, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.    Statistics Department figures show total debt fell to 32.94billion N.Z. Dlrs in the December quarter from 33.42 billion inSeptember, although the government's share rose to 21.32billion from 20.75 billion.    Douglas said in a statement this was due to the boosting ofreserves to refinance so-called "Think Big" projects.    "These reserves do not add to New Zealand's totalindebtedness.... They are money in the bank," he said.    "As negotiations to refinance each Think Big project arecompleted, existing loans will be replaced with debt currentlyheld in reserves for this purpose," Douglas added.    This in turn will result in a drop in quasi-government andprivate debt, he said.    He said refinancing of projects allowed the government toborrow on more favourable terms and to manage Think Big debtsmore effectively.    "Both of these will reduce the cost of Think Big to thetaxpayer over time," he said. "The refinancing also paves the wayto deregulation of the oil industry." REUTER&#3;
