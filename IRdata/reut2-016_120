Eurobonds for Texaco Inc subsidiarieswere unquoted this morning as traders assessed the implicationsof the company's shock weekend decision to file for bankruptcyunder Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy laws, eurobond dealerssaid.    The decision to file for bankruptcy follows a courtdecision that it had to post an 11 billion dlr bond to continueits court battles with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    One head trader at a U.S. Securities house said, "I don'twant to be obstructive, but there genuinely is no market inTexaco bonds at the moment. Everyone is stunned by the decision(to file for bankruptcy) and can't really believe it."    One dealer noted that Texaco subsidiaries have outstandingeurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of totalborrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.    He added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollarstraights - had been trading "basis only" for some time prior tothis weekend's news. This means traders could quote a two wayprice for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. Anytrades would be negotiated.    He said that recently there appeared to have been somespeculative buying of the bonds from the U.S. But that Europeaninvestors had been overall sellers.    Dealers noted that under the Chapter 11 filing noteholderswill receive no interest payments.    Texaco also has eurobonds outstanding which are convertibleinto Texaco Inc common stock - known as convertibles. Tradingdid not open in these issues either. One convertible dealersaid, "We're waiting to see the result of today's court hearing."Texaco is applying today in the Texas courts for relief fromhaving to post the court bond.
