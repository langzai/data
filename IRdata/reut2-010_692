Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidthat the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributableto the perception inside and outside Japan that the country hasfailed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand.    He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament thatit was natural for other nations to think that Japan is notdoing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88budget.    The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts ofParliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax. Reuter&#3;
