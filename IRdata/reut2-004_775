Salomon Inc has lowered its investmentratings on all U.S. money center banks, institutional sourcessaid.    The sources said Salomon believes that other money centerbanks may feel compelled to follow Citicorp's &lt;CCI> leadin its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commissionrelating to its loan exposure to Brazil.    They also said Salomon believes that other banks maystrongly consider the possibility of placing Brazilian loans ona non-accruing status with the consequent negative impact onearnings.    The sources said the ratings were lowered to M from O-plus.The stock are now expected to match the Standard and Poor's 500Index, rather than outperform the index as previously expected.    The sources said it is also understood that the change inthe coding of these stocks should definitely not be taken as asell-recommendation because Salomon is said to believe that itsdowngrading will only prove temporary.    The banks affected by the change in investment coding areBank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK>, Bankers Trust Co &lt;BT>, ChaseManhattan Corp &lt;CMB>, Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL>, Citicorp&lt;CCI>, Irving Bank Corp &lt;V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>,J.P. Morgan and Co Inc &lt;JPM>, Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>,Republic New York Corp &lt;RNB>, Bank of Boston Corp &lt;BKB> andFirst Chicago Corp &lt;FNB>.    The institutional sources said that Thomas Hanley, adirector of Salomon Inc subsidiary Salomon Brothers who is incharge of bank stock research, believes Citicorp's move iswell-timed.    Should Citicorp actually place the Brazilian loans in anon-performing category at the end of this quarter this actionwould serve to alleviate the urgency associated with the debtnegotiations, he argues.    Thus Citicorp's bargaining position would appear to havebeen much enhanced. Reuter&#3;
