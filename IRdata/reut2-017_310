About 20 members of the Taiwanparliament criticised the government for holding too much offoreign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars and asked the cabinetto diversify these holdings into other major currencies.    A parliament statement said the criticism came from 18Kuomintang (nationalist) legislators and several oppositionmembers, who asked the government to diversify reserves intomark, yen, Swiss franc, other currencies or gold.    It said that from September 1985 to September 1986 thecentral bank's exchange rate loss was about 144 billion Taiwandlrs.    Fourteen local banks lost 12.6 billion Taiwan dlrs duringthe period, it said.    In the same time span the Taiwan dollar rose to 36.77 tothe U.S. Currency from 40.45. It closed at 33.17 today.    The statement said the central bank's loss this year wouldmore than double because of the rising Taiwan dollar andreserves, which had reached 54 billion U.S. Dlrs last week.
