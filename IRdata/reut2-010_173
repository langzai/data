Burr-Brown Corp said its firstquarter 1987 results will show profits significantly below the1,058,000 dlrs, or 11 cts per share, earned in the firstquarter last year.    The company said the profit decline will be the result ofan increase in reserves for inventory valuation. The increasewill be to cover potential write-downs of certain inventoriesor products used in compact-disc stereo systems.    Burr-Brown said the possible write-down is beingprecipitated by a shift in market demand toward higherperformance products. Reuter&#3;
