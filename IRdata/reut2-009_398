Todd Shipyards Corp said itomitted payment of the quarterly dividend on its common stockand lowered the dividend on its series A preferred stock to 75cts from 77 cts a share.    Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May oneto shareholders of record April 15.    The company said it omitted the common dividend to coverboth losses from a commercial ship conversion contract andincreased reserves for previously announced discontinuedshipyard operations.    In addition, the company said its lenders agreed totemporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolvingcredit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln.    The reduction will hold through May 15, it said.    Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirementallowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and preventedit from violating covenants of its credit agreement.    The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders toextend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.    Todd added that it has suffered financially because of theU.S. Navy's unwillingness to release certain retentions undercompleted ship construction contracts and a general decrease inU.S. military spending.
