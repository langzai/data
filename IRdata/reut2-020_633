TLX Partners, a group led by AsherEdelman, does not see any problems with its 65 dlr per sharebid for Telex Corp, a Shearson Lehman official advising thegroup said.    Several other takeover proposals have crumbled followingdeclines in financial markets, leading to speculation thatEdelman might also drop his offer. Telex fell 11 to 34-1/4.    Earlier today, Carl Icahn dropped his bid to take TransWorld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> private and Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O>said it abandoned plans to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH>.    Both cited market conditions.    "Nothing fundamental has changed with the company. Thestock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed sothere's no reason for us to change," said Daniel Good, head ofShearson Lehman merchant banking.    "Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect thatat the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will bein place," Good said.    Shearson has agreed to provide bridge financing of up to 600 mln dlrs for the Edelman group. Reuter&#3;
