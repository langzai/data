Belgian banks will need greaterflexibility to choose their sphere of operations by 1992, whenthe European Community is due to introduce free competition inbanking throughout the bloc, Generale de Banque SA &lt;GENB.BR>president Eric de Villegas de Clercamp told a news conference.    He said at present Belgian and Italian banks were the mostrestricted in the EC.    While German banks were free to hold stakes in commercialcompanies in which they invested capital, Belgian banks coulddo so only in severely limited circumstances for short periods.    "The authorities concerned should introduce within areasonable period major modifications toward greater freedomand flexibility if we want to retain competitiveness with theneighbouring countries," de Villegas said.    He said the EC authorities envisaged that after 1992financial institutions would be able to start operationsthroughout the EC.    Since the control of each institution would remain in thehands of the authorities in its country of origin, rulesapplied in member states could distort competition unless theywere harmonised.
