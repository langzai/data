Republicans in Congress hailedPresident Reagan's speech on the Iran arms scandal as candidand constructive while Democrats, who control both houses, saidReagan would now have to match his words with action.    Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (Democrat) of WestVirginia said in a television interview he was heartened thatReagan had acknowledged some of his mistakes. "But one speech isnot enough to rebuild trust."    "President Reagan told the American people what they neededto hear, that mistakes were made and he made them," SenateRepublican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said.    Reagan, responding to the Tower Commission reportcriticising his role in the Iran arms scandal, said for thefirst time the Iran arms policy, and not just itsimplementation, was a mistake and accepted responsibility forthe diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels.    Senator Bill Bradley (Democrat) of New Jersey said theadministration would "remain under a cloud" until several keyfigures in the scandal, including fired National SecurityCouncil (NSC) aide Oliver North and his boss Adm. JohnPoindexter, have told "the whole truth."    Republicans and Democrats praised the appointment on Fridayof former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker to replaceDonald Regan as chief of staff, and the replacement ofPoindexter with Frank Carlucci to head the NSC.    Assistant House Republican Leader Trent Lott ofMississippi, said he believed Reagan took the right measure inadmitting mistakes without apologising for them.    Some House Democrats, including Speaker James Wright ofTexas, said earlier they would delay their reaction untiltomorrow in order to study the speech overnight and assess itsimpact. REUTER&#3;
