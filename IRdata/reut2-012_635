An amendment approved by the HouseAgriculture Committee yesterday requiring quotas on U.S.imports of products containing sugar is unlikely to remain in acomprehensive trade bill, Congressional sources said.    The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.,would require quotas on the import of any merchandisecontaining over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which arenow subject to U.S. quotas.    Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbingshipments of food products containing sugar from Canada.However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overalljurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill theamendment as protectionist, a committee aide said.    An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposalprobably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees.But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send awarning to U.S. companies considering moving food processingplants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota.    In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland andother supporters said the proposal would have no effect on thestatus of foreign trade zones.    Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment onsugar-containing products because they believe sugar is beingshipped to the United States in food products as a way tocircumvent the quota on raw sugar.    The sugar quota is only one mln short tons this year. Reuter&#3;
