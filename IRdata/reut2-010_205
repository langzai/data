Great American Corp saidpreliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANKsubsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mlndlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs.    The charge will be made against the allowance for possibleloan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate.    Great American said the examiners were conducting a regularexamination and a final report is not expected for severalweeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedownin response to the preliminary findings.    Great American said regulatory authorities are notrequiring an adjustment of the previously reported financialresults for Great American for 1986.    However, Great American has revised its previous estimatesof provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs tothe allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it tookthe action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete itsallowance for possible loan losses and the economic environmentdoes not show signs for significant improvement in the nearfuture.    It said the additional provision increases the allowance to26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loanportfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end.    Great American said its revised net loss for the fourthquarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to anet loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the yearearlier. Reuter&#3;
