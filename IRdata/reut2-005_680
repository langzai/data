BankAmerica Corp chairman A.W.Clausen said he believes Brazil will successfully restructureits foreign debt sometime this year, but in the meantime thatcountry's creditors could suffer somwehat over the short term.    He also said Brazil's decision to suspend foreign debtpayments is most likely a move aimed at strengthening itsnegotiating position.    "I believe it was a posturing move on the part of thecountry," Clausen said.    Clausen made his comments during an address at a Chamber ofCommerce luncheon here.    Last month Brazil, which has about 110 billion dlrs offoreign debt, suspended payment on some 68 billion dlrs ownedto private banks while it worked out its economic problems.    BankAmerica has some 2.74 billion dlrs in loans outstandingto Brazil.    Clausen also said he did not think any financialinstitutions would be "done in" by Brazil's suspension of debtpayments and he added "I do not believe the InternationalMonetary Fund will come to a roaring halt."
