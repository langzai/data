ChemLawn Corp said its boardrejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offerand urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.    ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financialadvisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek otherpurchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.    ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or"poison pill," during a 120-intermin safeguard period its boardadopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through anymeans other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks otherpurchasers.    ChemLawn also said it began litigation against WasteManagement in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive andother relief.    The suit alleges, among other things, that certain WasteManagement officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stockbefore making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchasespossibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and theSecurities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.    Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquireChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.    ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offerwas inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees,suppliers, creditors, and customers.    "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer andconcluded that it does not fully reflect the value of thecompany. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender theirshares to Waste Management," said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.    ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protectshareholders against abusive tactics, such as "marketaccumulations by Waste Management or others."    Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will bedistributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawncommon.    ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of itscommon for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of itscommmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all itsshares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.    It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days afterthey become exercisable if later than that date. It said itsboard may redeem the rights for five cts per right any timeprior to their exercise date.    ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchasespurusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.    It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of recordMarch 20. Reuter&#3;
