The European Community Commission saidtoday it has shelved threatened legal action against WestGermany's Lufthansa &lt;LHAG.F>, Alitalia of Italy &lt;AERI.MI> andOlympic Airways of Greece after they agreed to change practicesthat restrict competition in the heavily-protected EC sector.    The Commission had also written to seven other Communityairlines, including British Airways &lt;BAB.L> and Air France,last summer warning them that agreements such as capacity andrevenue sharing accords broke EC competition rules. The sevenhave already agreed to hold talks with the Commission onbringing such practices into line with the rules.    In a statement, the EC's executive authority also spelledout tough demands it will be putting to carriers in talks onliberalising EC air transport and bringing down airfares,warning that new legal moves were possible if they refused tocomply.    As a first step, the Commission wanted the 10 carriers toeliminate the most serious distortions of competition caused bythe current practices and agreements.    The latest demands go further towards liberalisation thanproposals that are currently the subject of difficultnegotiations between by EC Transport Ministers. REUTER&#3;
