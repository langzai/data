A Swedish virologist unveiled a new AIDSblood test using synthetic antigens, or substances whichcombine with antibodies to make them detectable, which would bemuch cheaper and more reliable than existing tests.    Anders Vahlne said the test, developed at GothenburgUniversity, was accurate enough to eliminate the need for asecond test usually carried out to double-check those found tobe "AIDS positive," that is with AIDS antibodies in their blood.    Vahlne said the test could be on the market in between fourand eight months. A small Swiss firm, Virovahl S.A., Helpedfinance it. REUTER&#3;
