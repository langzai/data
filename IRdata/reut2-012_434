Japan is doing all it can to solve itstrade problems with the United States but the two nations willremain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided inJapan's favour, a senior official said.    "So long as there is an external imbalance there will betrade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments,"the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.    Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus withthe United States and economists said they do not see itfalling significantly any time soon.    Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mlndlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising thespectre of a trade war between the two countries.    "We take the current situation very seriously," said theofficial, who declined to be identified. "The basic stance ofthe Japanese government is to tackle the issues with allavailable resources."    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on anagreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computermicrochips in world markets and to try to import more Americansemiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges.    The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japaneseretaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffsin the middle of this month. But he said that any responsewould be in accordance with international law and Japan'sinternational obligations.    He added that both Japan and the United States must takeaccount of the impact of their dispute on their own and theworld economy. REUTER&#3;
