General Motors Corp has cut 100,000cars from its second quarter production schedule, according toAutomotive News.    The trade paper, citing "sources both within GM and on theoutside," said GM plans to build 1,042,708 cars in the quarter,a nine pct reduction from its earlier estimate. The cut couldlead to further layoffs at GM, it said.    A GM spokesman said the company does not disclose future production schedules.    Auto analysts said the cut would make sense for GM, whichhas high car inventories.    A 100,000-car reduction in output would only take GM partof the way toward reducing high inventories, said Ron Glantz,analyst with Montgomery Securities.    "They should be cutting a lot more than they are," ShearsonLehman analyst Michael Lucky said. He estimated that, even ifGM cut an additional 100,000 cars from its second quarterproduction, it would still have a 75-day supply of cars.    Normal inventory level is 50 to 65 days supply. At the endof March, the automaker had 95 days supply, Lucky said.    Glantz said that at the end of February GM had 361,000excess vehicles, including both cars and trucks.    The production cuts could lead to increased layoffs,although those would likely be temporary rather than indefinitelayoffs, said Lucky.    He said the automaker might also use this as an opportunityto close some plants. Lucky estimates that GM needs to shut twoor three more assembly plants to bring its capacity more inline with demand.
