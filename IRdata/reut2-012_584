Heightened concern over renewedinflation is feeding the rally in silver and the upward movecould drive the inflation hedge metal this year to as much as9.00 dlrs per troy ounce, Mike Boswell chairman of SunshineMining Co told Reuters in an interview.    "The anticipated higher inflation is being manifested insilver rather than in gold which is the traditional choice ofinflation hedgers," said Boswell.    The strength could put silver in a range of "8.00 to 9.00dlrs even without any material swings in supply/demand,"Boswell said.    The buying interest for silver on the New York CommodityExchange (Comex) continued strong, with prices rising today toa September 1986 high of 6.465 dlrs per ounce. However goldlagged at 426.30 dlrs, the strongest price since late Januarythis year.    Boswell said silver has been "under-valued for so longrelative to gold but it's closing up the price gap."    He noted that silver last year held at the depressed levelof 5.00 dlrs while gold was soaring to more than 400.00 dlrs onconcern over the heated political unrest in South Africa. "Thestrength was not filtering down to silver last year. Nowwe're seeing a delayed reaction," the Sunshine Mining officialsaid.    Almost a year ago, U.S. producers shut down two of theirlargest silver properties, Sunshine and Hecla mining companies,both located in Idaho.    Boswell estimated that the closings slashed U.S. silverproduction by 10 mln ounces last year to less than 40 mlnounces.    "Low silver prices and high labor costs made ituneconomical to keep the mines opened," he said.    Increased imports from Mexico and Peru have made up for theloss of production in the United States which consumes 160 to170 mln ounces annually, Boswell said. Reuter&#3;
