Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domesticeconomy, the Centre for Economic Research of the FederalInstitute of Technology said in its spring review.    It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helpedto keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.    The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swisseconomy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the moredifficult international economic climate facing exportindustry.    The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth inSwiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.    Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as themotor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow bythree pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.    Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. Allthree figures are well below the Swiss average for recentyears. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.    The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which hasfirmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressureon Swiss exporters.    It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a moremodest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, whenimport prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.    Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986. REUTER&#3;
