Walbro Corp said it expectsits first-quarter results to reach "all-time highs."    It projected sales exceeding 32 mln dlrs, or up 21 pct fromthe 26,488,000 dlrs reported for the 1986 first quarter. Itsaid the previous high for a single quarter was 27,179,000 dlrsfor the 1986 fourth quarter.    Walbro estimated income for the quarter will exceedfirst-quarter 1986 income, which was 1,953,000 dlrs, or 66 ctsa share, by at least 40 pct. It said the first quarter of 1986had been the previous income record for a single quarter.    Walbro cited strong demand for its fuel systems products,especially automotive electronic fuel injection components andcarburetors for lawn and garden applications.    However, it said it is unlikely the company will sustainthe same record pace of sales and income throughout 1987, dueto an expected reduction in throttle body sales.    "It now appears likely that the company's throttle bodybusiness with General Motors Corp &lt;GM> will peak in the firstsix months of 1987, continue at reduced levels to July 1988 andsuffer an interruption for the period from July 1988 to July1989," Walbro added.
