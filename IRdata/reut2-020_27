U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the severity of the current rout on world stockmarkets was an absurd over-reaction sparked on Wall Street by aspreading lack of confidence in the U.S. Economy.    Lawson said in a BBC radio interview, "This began on WallStreet. It has a lot to do with the American stock market (and)a lack of confidence in the U.S. -  and some careless talk bythose who should have known better."    In a further wave of selling this morning in London, theFTSE 100 index had lost a further 233.2 points only 50 minutesafter the official 0800 GMT opening to stand at 1,819.1.    Lawson said a correction on world stock markets was to havebeen expected after the bull markets of recent years. "What wasnot expected was the severity of the downturn, which quitefrankly is rather absurd."    He said he saw no fundamental signs why the U.S. Economyshould go into recession, adding, "Indeed the possibility ofhigher (U.S.) interest rates would certainly in my judgment notlead the American economy into a recession."    "The only way in which the American economy would go intorecession was if it actually talks itself into recession," hesaid. REUTER&#3;
