India today signed an agreement tosell 500 mini passenger cars to Hungary, its first exportcontract for cars, an industry ministry spokesman told Reuters.    Under the agreement signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd (MUL) -an Indo-Japanese car maker - and Hungary's state-owned Mogurttrading company - the cars, valued about two mln dlrs, will bedelivered in 1987, he said.    "We expect Hungary will buy up to 5,000 Maruti cars per yearfrom next year if the first batch proves popular in thatcountry," he said without elaborating.    The launching of 800 cc Maruti cars in 1983 revolutionisedthe country's dormant automobile industry, which until then hadmarketed models which were at least 30 years old.    The Indian government owns 74 pct stake in MUL, and thebalance of 26 pct is held by Suzuki Motor Co Ltd of Japan.    The Japanese-style Maruti, costing about 81,000 rupees, isthe cheapest car on the Indian market and has proved a popularmodel, with order books full for the next three years, industrysources said.    MUL and India's three private companies have a combinedproduction capacity of 206,000 passenger cars a year. REUTER&#3;
