James Hardie Industries Ltd &lt;HAHA.S> saidthe 28 pct increase in its 1986/87 net profit reflected thebenefits of continuing rationalisation and consolidation ofAustralian activities and expansion in the U.S.    The diversified building products group reported netearnings rose to 60.58 mln dlrs in the year ended March 31 from47.42 mln in 1985/86. It lifted annual dividend to 24 centsfrom 22 with a final of 13, against 11 previously.    Hardie had concentrated resources on building up its corebusinesses of building products, paper merchanting andtechnology and services, it said in a statement.    Hardie said it sold a number of businesses during the yearwhich were unable to meet objectives for return on investmentor market share and some non-core units.    This resulted in a decline in sales to 1.50 billion dlrsfrom 1.56 billion, but also contributed to a fall of about 100mln dlrs in borrowings by year-end and a 36 pct drop ininterest expense to 29.16 mln dlrs, it said.    Hardie said a 42 pct jump in second-half net earnings to29.66 mln dlrs from 20.92 mln a year earlier was particularlypleasing in view of the difficult trading conditions faced bythe building products businesses in Australia.    The problems in U.S. Irrigation operations which adverselyaffected 1985/86 earnings have been overcome, Hardie said.    It said the process of rationalisation and consolidationhad continued into the current year as had expansion into theU.S.    Hardie said it could now look forward to a period ofdevelopment and further growth in Australia and overseas aftercarrying through a long and expensive process of eliminatingasbestos, the group's original prime raw material, from itsfibre cement building products over the past eight years.
