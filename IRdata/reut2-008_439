The Philippines and its commercial bankadvisory committee will resume talks tomorrow on what bankershope will be the final leg of negotiations for a 9.4 billiondlr debt rescheduling package.    Bankers, attending the Inter-American Development Bankannual meeting here, said the two sides are still working on aplan that embraces Manila's proposal to pay interest partlywith Philippine investment notes (PIN) instead of cash.    One senior banker said he hoped that final agreement wouldbe reached this week but cautioned that a number of majorissues are still outstanding.    The senior banker said that the remaining issues includeinterest rates and the exact form of the investment notes plan.    However, bankers did not anticipate any accounting problemsfor this novel interest payment method.    Deputy U.S. Comptoller of the Currency Robert Bench saidlast week that U.S. bank regulators also had no objection inprinciple to the PINs concept because Manila has guaranteedtheir ready conversion into cash.
