Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG&lt;BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mlnmarks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholderAachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG &lt;AMVG.F>, AMB, said.    But total operating and extraordinary profits, includingearnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's ownaccount and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.    BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB'scapital increase, which is to finance the insurance company'sacquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.    Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid anunchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred anunchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,&lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from whichAMB has acquired the majority stake.    The bank has said its business last year suffered from theturbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housingconcern Neue Heimat.    AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in theinterest margin to 1.9 pct.    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step uprisk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasisedbecause of the continuing difficulties of some countries.    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West Germanaccounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pctof this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01pct of &lt;Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9pct of &lt;BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> andfive pct of &lt;Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linkedto AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transferagreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions. REUTER&#3;
