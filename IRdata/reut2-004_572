China has to decide if it will increasesugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output andrising demand, in view of market predictions that internationalsugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and theofficial press said.    He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry andFisheries, said this week that China has adjusted thepurchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop inproduction last year but he gave no price details.    One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidlybecause of improving living standards and rising demand forsweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.    "It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in astate-controlled economy. China may have to import," he said.    Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes inJanuary 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.    The official Economic Information newspaper last month saidproduction in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April)will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.    The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.    "In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beethas fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has droppedand cannot meet demand that is rising every day," it said.    "The country will have to continue imports of sugar and drawdown stocks to meet market demand," it added.    It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming thedrop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for caneand beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmersrefusing to grow them.    The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to threetimes more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up toseven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He couldsell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.    Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices havenot changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.    In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuanin 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.    The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losingmoney. China has 521 sugar mills.    A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in caneacreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct inGuangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct ofChina's sugar in calendar 1985.    He said both provinces are more developed than othersugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.    But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.    He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.    A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mlnat end-January. "Now they are falling but (they) have notreached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"he said.    "China has options not easily available in westerncountries. It controls stocks strictly and can release lessinto the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly," he said.    The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will beslightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world pricesand serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, arelikely to continue until at least end-1988.    He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-ownedmills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.    "Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many ofthem using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s," he said.    He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annualfour pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct. REUTER&#3;
