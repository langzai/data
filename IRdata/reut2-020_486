Alan Powers, chief of the Minerals Maanagement Service forthe department, said the delay is to have more time to studythe effects of drilling noise on whale migrations.    Powers said the state has asked for additional noise datafor the sale area off Alaska's North Slope. A new date has notbeen set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March,Powers said.
