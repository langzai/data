Chilean left-wing leaders wereelected by the copper workers union for the first time sincethe left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown ina 1973 coup.     Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation ofCopperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed inthe state-owned copper mines, union officials said.    Other members of the MDP, which includes the communistparty and a faction of the socialist party, took five of theprincipal positions on the union's directorate.    The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) producesaround 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mlntonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporterand sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.    The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union'sdirectorate in elections earlier this month, with the christiandemocratic party holding five and the remainder being won byindependents.    But the left-wing was left in control of the union afterthe christian democrats and independents failed to reachagreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrewfrom negotiations.    Union elections were called following the resignation offormer president Rodolfo Seguel last October.    Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known unionleader, said he was forced to step down after repeated courtactions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.    The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union nationalworkers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCOfollowing a strike in 1983.    The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in thepast 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests againstthe military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.     CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as unionleader when no longer employed by the company. Reuter&#3;
