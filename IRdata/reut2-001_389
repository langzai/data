Memory Metals Inc said itreceived a contract from the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration to research and develop joints and couplingsusing special alloys.    The company said the two-year contract, worth 500,000 dlrs,calls for Memory to study the joints and couplings for advancedcomposite materials, which are strong and light, but difficultto join reliably.    It said the alloys are trained to remember and take on apredetermined shape and selected temperaturers. Reuter&#3;
