The Bank of Japan will sell 500 billionyen of financing bills via a 32-day repurchase agreement tohelp mop up a money market surplus of around 1,750 billion yentomorrow, short-term money houses said.    The bill, to mature on May 2, will produce a 3.8995 pctyield on the sales, made by the Bank of Japan to banks andseucurities houses through money houses, they said.    The repurchase agreement yield compares with the 3.9375 pctone-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.40 pctrate on one-month certificates of deposit.    The surplus is due largely to government tax allocations tolocal governments and public entities at the end of fiscal1986/87 tomorrow.
