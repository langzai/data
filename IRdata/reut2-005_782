Britain's Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR) showed a provisional net repayment of 300mln stg in February, compared with an unrevised 3.7billion stg repayment in January, the Treasury said.    This gives a cumulative PSBR in the first 11 months of thecurrent fiscal year of 100 mln stg, compared with a 2.7 billionrequirement in the like period last year.    The government's forecast for the PSBR in fiscal 1986/87 is7.1 billion stg, but markets expect a significant undershoot onthis number. The February data was within market forecasts.
