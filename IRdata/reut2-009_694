Lucas Industries Plc &lt;LUCS.L> said itsunderlying performance would continue to improve in the secondhalf but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K.Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in NorthAmerican electronics.    The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretaxprofit to 40 mln in the six months to end-January. The figurewas some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares droppedsharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night's close of 590p.    It said it would continue with plans for all its activitiesto be internationally competitive and profitable.    Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee trainingand retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses,together with high research and development spending wouldaffect profits in the short term.    But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities inautomotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and enginemanagement systems. Recent acquisitions in North America hadstrengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems. REUTER&#3;
