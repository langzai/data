High interest rates, sluggish globaleconomic growth and creeping protectionism are deepening thethird world debt crisis, senior Mexican officials said.    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said today's signing ofa 76 billion dlr new-loan and rescheduling package for Mexicowas the most comprehensive and far-reaching effort in debtmanagement yet achieved for a sovereign borrower.    But, in remarks prepared for the signing ceremony, hewarned against complacency. "The debt problem is not solved. Ifanything, it has been exacerbated by recent events."    "The inequities of the international economic environmentconspire against the welfare and stability of developingcountries," Petricioli added. The debt problem will not besolved unless developing countries are allowed to grow, heargued. "There will be no solution without the furtherdevelopment of trade throughout the world.".    Director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters thatMexico's economy should resume growth this year, but he saidexternal conditions are not favorable. Latin America isgrappling with adverse terms of trade, for instance, asunderlined by the recent slide in coffee prices.    Interest rates remain unacceptably high in real terms,Gurria added. "Inflation has literally disappeared from theface of the earth in the industrialized world, but interestrates are still near seven pct."    Industrial powers must also improve the coordination oftheir economic policies to boost unacceptably low growth ratesand to keep export markets open, said Gurria, who is Mexico'schief debt negotiator.    The officials also had a blunt warning for those banks thatrefuse to participate in the loan package: Do not expect to getmuch business with Mexico in the future.    About 60 of Mexico's 430 or so creditor banks worldwidehave still to join the loan, but four more acceptances werereceived today, according to senior Citibank executive WilliamRhodes, who is co-chairman of Mexico's advisory committee.    "Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico willcontinue to be open and willing to share with them the businessopportunities which its future growth will create.    "Those few who have denied their responsibility have turnedtheir backs on this remarkable effort of internationalcooperation, on the financial system and on their enlightenedcolleagues," Petricioli said.    One way that Mexico could punish recalcitrant banks wouldbe to deny, or at least slow down, applications to convertMexican debt into equity investments within the country.    "We will be a lot more expeditious in processing therequests of banks that have supported us," Gurria said, adding,"We have long memories."    Debt-equity conversions are an attractive way for banks toprovide clients with subsidized pesos for investment in Mexicoand to collect handsome brokerage fees or reduce their ownMexican exposure in the process.        The growing popularity of the scheme was underlined thisweek when American Express Bank, which has joined the newMexican package, said it plans to convert 100 mln dlrs of itsown loans into an equity stake in hotel projects in Mexico.    Mexico halted the debt-equity program on Feb. 25 to forcebanks to concentrate on wrapping up the financing pakcage, andGurria said it would resume once the first part of the sixbillion dlr loan that forms the core of the deal is disbursed.    The loan is now 99 pct subscribed. Gurria said Mexico hopesto close the books by the middle of April in time for adrawdown by the end of April.    Although the agreements were signed in the sumptuoussurroundings of a midtown Manhattan hotel, the atmosphere ofthe signing ceremony was rather subdued, with bankers andofficials showing little of the elation and relief thatnormally follows the conclusion of a mammoth deal.    After five months of arduous work syndicating the loan,debt fatigue was apparent and the talk was of ways to make thefinancing process less cumbersome.    "This (package) has been harder than all the others... Ihope we find a way that's not so debilitating for the peoplewho have to put them together," Gurria said. Reuter&#3;
