Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaintagainst Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance innegotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japanend quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by theend of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling willfavor the U.S.    "These are quota items, and the principles that apply tothem, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question ofwhether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus," Lyngtold Reuters in an interview.    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas onbeef and citrus after March 31, next year.    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the UnitedStates has challenged include items such as tomato paste, somecheeses and specialty fruit juices.    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas wouldbe issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision hasbeen delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrusquotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protectJapanese farmers.    "We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (onbeef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that anillegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.    He declined to say what action the U.S. would take nextApril if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.    Reuter&#3;
