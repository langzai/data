Iran attacked across snow-capped peaks of northeastern Iraqlast week in an area which saw heavy fighting in mid-1983.    The thrust followed fierce battles near Basra, Iraq'ssecond city on the southern front of the 6-1/2-year-oldconflict, after an Iranian cross-border offensive launched onJanuary 9.    The political department head at Iraq's Defence Ministry,Abdul Jabbar Muhsen, said on Monday fighting was continuing inthe north but that Iran had exaggerated battle reports.    He said Tehran had done this "to make up for failure in thesouth and to encourage anti-Baghdad Kurdish rebels to supportits troops."
