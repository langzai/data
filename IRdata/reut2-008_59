Taiwan's industrial production index,fell, largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar, by8.18 pct to 140.06 (base 1981) in February from a revised152.53 in January, the Economy Ministry said.    It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after droppingnine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February1986 following a very extended rise last year.    The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82.    A ministry official attributed the decline to fallingproduction of non-metal products, textiles and transportationequipment, and less mining and house construction.    The official said the decline was also caused by fallingexports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar,which has made Taiwanese products more expensive.    He expected the decline to continue in the next few monthsbecause of further appreciation of the local dollar against theU.S. Currency.    The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against theU.S. Dollar since September 1985. It closed at 34.40 to theU.S. Dollar today, and is expected to rise to about 32 to thedollar by the end of this year, foreign bankers and economistssaid. REUTER&#3;
