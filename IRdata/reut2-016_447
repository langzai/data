Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said itexpects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary forabout two billion dlrs in about two months.    After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer,Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr ashare from continuing operations in the first quarter. In thesame year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents ashare from continuing operations.    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buyingCeleron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.    Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almostcomplete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserveswould not be sold separately from the pipeline.    Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag forCeleron was too high, Mercer said "There is no fire sale goingon here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitableoperation throughout the year."    Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit wasbased on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchaselast year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeoverbid. Reuter&#3;
