The executive committee of the Italiannational banking association (ABI), representing the country'smajor credit institutions, approved the setting up of a commonreserve fund to guarantee customer deposits in the event ofbank failures.    ABI chairman Giannino Parravicini told a news conferencethat the fund would not be operative until the latter part of1987, and only on condition that 60 pct of banks representingat least 75 pct of total deposits participated.    He said the fund would initially have 1,000 billion lireavailable and would cover deposits of up to three billion lire.    A statute for establishing a deposit guarantee fund hasalready been approved by the Bank of Italy and by aninterministerial committee on credit and savings.    The 1,000 billion lire initial funding, which will beprovided through contributions from banks which opt to join thescheme, compares with an originally targetted figure of 4,000billion lire.    Parravicini said the fund would be gradually increased to4,000 billion lire by end 1991, and that the decision toachieve this figure gradually rather than immediately was dueto fiscal considerations.    The fund, still to be formally ratified by ABI's steeringcommittee, will provide 100 pct coverage on deposits of up to200 mln lire, 90 pct on deposits between 200 mln and onebillion lire and 80 pct on those between one billion and threebillion lire.    Assuming that all banks join the fund, contributions wouldbe equivalent to around 0.25 pt of a bank's total deposits.    The ABI's steering committee later unanimously ratified theexecutive committee's decision to create the common reservefund. REUTER&#3;
