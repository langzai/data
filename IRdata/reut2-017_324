French producers have withdrawn alloffers to sell more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar into EuropeanCommunity intervention stocks, EC Commission sources said.    They also said West German producers had now withdrawn thelast 3,000 of the 79,250 tonnes they sold into EC stores onApril 1.    The sales were made to protest against the level of exportrestitutions being granted for sugar at weekly EC tenders.    Last Friday, commission sources said the West Germanproducers had withdrawn all but 3,000 tonnes of their sales.    The protest by European producers involved sales of 854,000tonnes of sugar into intervention, of which 785,000 tonnes wereaccepted by the commission.    Under EC regulations, operators had five weeks beforereceiving payment to withdraw the sugar.    Their decision to withdraw the sugar follows whatcommission sources have said is a slight shift in theauthority's stance in recent weeks. The commission last weekincreased the maximum restitutions to within about 0.5 Ecus perkilo of the prices which traders claim are needed to matchintervention prices. Reuter&#3;
