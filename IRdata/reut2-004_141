Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoasurplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commoditybuying, told a news conference.    The company expects prices to remain at around currentlevels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stockrules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believesmarket intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabiliseprices.    Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weakif any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement.    Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproductionwill continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast acontinued build-up in stocks.    The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprisedmarket observers.    Unless reason prevails and the major producers return tothe conference table, the world coffee market will remain freeand the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee fortheir foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Srokaadded.
