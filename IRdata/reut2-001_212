Another 40.9 mln is available immediately under thecompensatory financing facility, the IMF's pool of funds toassist countries hit by export shortfalls. The IMF said thatJamaica had a shortfall in the year ended September 1986 due toreduced sales of Bauxite, alummina and travel expenditures.    After some deterioration, the situation and prospects forJamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainlyas a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates,and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the IMF said.    The program that the new funding supports is designed tocontinue the adjustment and restructuring effort so as toachieve sustained growth, a lower rate of inflation and abalance of payments viability in the medium term.
