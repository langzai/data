Wall Street market analysts said twochanges in the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Averagewere part of a shift away from smokestack industries that havelong dominated the 30-stock index.    "It strengthens the Dow," said William LeFevre, analyst atAdvest Inc. He said Coca-Cola Co &lt;KO>, one of the twoadditions, "is a genuine consumer stock as opposed to asmokestack." He applauded the decision to drop Inco Ltd &lt;N>, "asuper stock at one time that hasn't done much lately."    The editors of the Wall Street Journal also decided to addBoeing Co &lt;BA> and dropping Owens-Illinois Inc &lt;OI>.    Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said Inco was a "stodgynumber." But he noted that putting two new stocks in an averageof 30 is a relatively minor change.    "This will distinctly make the index more useful," saidFrank Korth of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "The movement ofthe market to the upside will be enhanced by the shift toCoke."    But he said Shearson's aerospace analyst today removedBoeing from the firm's recommended list, taking it from a buyto a hold. Korth said Boeing's business appeared to be leaningtoo heavily to the military side as opposed to commercial.    Prior to tomorrow's market opening the Wall Street Journalwill publish a new divisor to be used in calculating the index.LeFevre said the divisor will probably go up a bit but willprobably be lower than its current level of 0.889 later in theyear due to forthcoming splits in components such asInternational Paper Co &lt;IP>.    The divisor, which is adjusted whenver stocks are split,dropped below one for the first time in May of last year. The0.889 divisor means that a change of 1/8 (12.5 cts) in theprice of a component produces a change of about 14 cts in theindex. Reuter&#3;
