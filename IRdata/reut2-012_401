Bank of Zambia general manager MichaelMwape has accused the International Monetary Fund of ignoringsocial conditions when drawing up its economic reformprogrammes for African countries.    Mwape said in a speech to businessmen in the southern townof Livingstone yesterday that the IMF's approach had causedsocial and political unrest across the continent.    There was widespread rioting and looting in Zambia lastDecember after the government abolished subsidies on refinedmaize meal in line with IMF recommendations.    Mwape said told businessmen "The question which should beasked and answered when designing programmes is who is going tobear the brunt of adjustment ... And what cushion is availableto minimise the burden ?"    Zambia has had five IMF adjustment programmes since 1976,the last of which was cancelled in February last year, he said."In spite of these, the economy has shown signs of stress, withno significant improvement in a number of areas," he added.    Zambia has just completed a new round of IMF talks on itsforeign exchange system and has obtained enough commercialloans to pay off its IMF arrears for 1985 and 1986, paving theway for a new stand-by credit.    Zambian politicians have frequently criticised the fund,however, and diplomats say President Kenneth Kaunda facesconsistent opposition inside the ruling party's centralcommittee over dealings with the IMF.
