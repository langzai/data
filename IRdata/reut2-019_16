Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress(I) party was swept from power in the northern state of Haryanaby an opposition landslide.    The loss was a major personal setback for Gandhi whosevote-winning ability was on trial after political scandals inDelhi and a string of electoral losses since he took command ofthe party in 1984.    With 53 results in for Haryana's 90-seat assembly, Congresshad won only two seats against 63 previously. Before the poll,Congress politicians in Delhi said privately that a loss inHaryana could open a party leadership debate. REUTER&#3;
