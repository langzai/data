American Telephone and Telegraph Cosaid it is proposing a new simplified approach to regulatingthe long-distance telecommunications market.    In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, ATTproposed replacing the current rate of return regulation withsimplified rules that "would eliminate many costs now imposed oncustomers while freeing ATT to introduce new services andpricing options more swiftly."    The filing comes one day after MCI Communications Corp saidthe firm will seek immediate deregulation of its principallong-distance competitor, ATT.    Under the approach outlined in the filing, ATT would committo continue providing basic long-distance services to allcustomers and to maintain uniform nationwide prices in allparts of the country unless granted regulatory approval to dootherwise.    Specifically, ATT proposed that the FCC require the companyto file tariffs for new interstate services and price changesthat would go into effect within 14 days.    In addition, the proposal calls for the reduction of thevoluminous documentation ATT is required to file each time itintroduces or changes long-distance services.    The new proposal would place the burden on challengers todemonstrate that ATT's tariffs "are unreasonable".    It would also require long-distance companies to submitperiodic reports to help regulators monitor competition in theindustry.    Lawrence Garfinkel, ATT's Vice-President of MarketingServices, said, "With this filing, we're suggesting thatregulators replace a blanket approach to regulating ATT with amore finely tuned, targeted approach."
