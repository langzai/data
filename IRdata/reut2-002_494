Costa Rica's economy minister said hesees new hope for winning changes in the International CoffeeOrganisation system of export quotas.    Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president ofthe Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful becauseof the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing-nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britainand the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.    Escalante told a news conference here he "carried the weightof the negotiations" at the meeting by calling for larger exportquotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.    Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quotasystem based on a producing nation's real export capacity, onceit has satisfied internal demand.    "There are countries such as our own whose salespossibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their currentquotas," Escalante said.    At the same time, there are countries favoured by thecurrent system that have been assigned quotas far above theirexport potential, he said.    The current ICO quota system is "unfair and autocratic,"Escalante said.    Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffeeprices over the last week to speculation rather than realmatters of supply and demand.    "Be careful," he warned, "there's not as much coffee in theworld as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust." Reuter&#3;
