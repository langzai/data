The Finance Ministry has asked trust banksto moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said.    A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week theMinistry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions byinstitutional investors, but he declined to say whether thiswas aimed at moderating the dollar sales.    Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to selldollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministrymonitoring.    One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizingwith the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conducttheir foreign exchange operations according to the dictates ofthe market.    A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved ofthe survey as long it was not used too forcefully.    But another official denied local press reports that thecentral bank itself had asked investors to moderate theirdollar sales. "We are not legally authorized to do that," hesaid.    A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank willrenew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessiveloans for the purpose of land and securities investment as suchinvestments threaten to cause inflation.    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previouslyexpressed concern about excessive investment in land andsecurities resulting partly from eased credit conditions. REUTER&#3;
