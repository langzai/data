The Basin Pipeline in the SouthwesternU.S. reopened yesterday with the expectation that all crude oilshipments for June will arrive on schedule, according to aspokesman for Texaco Inc. &lt;TX>, operator of the pipelinethrough its Texaco Pipeline Co subsidiary.    "We project the pipeline will make all June crude shipmentsscheduled," said Dan Stevens, the spokesman.     The pipeline reopened Sunday evening around 1900 EDT,carrying an equivalent 280,000 barrels of crude oil per daycompared with an average 225,000 bpd shipped during the 30 daysbefore its shutdown on May 30, according to Stevens.    Stevens said the increased shipments will make up for allcrude oil scheduled to arrive in Cushing, Oklahoma via thepipeline by the end of June.    The pipeline was shut May 30 because of an apparent rupturecaused by flooding of the Red River, near the Texas/Oklahomaborder. It was expected to resume service Saturday but risingwaters of the river, which had recently receded, delayed thereopening, Stevens said. Approximately 1100 feet of new 24-inchsteel piping was installed under the river to replace damagedpiping, according to Stevens. Reuter&#3;
