Current prospects for this year'sgrain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable thanin 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgradesaid in a field report.    The report said the assessment was based on travel in thetwo countries from March 30 to April 4.    It said crop conditions were better than earlier expectedfollowing the extreme dry conditions last fall and theprolonged winter temperatures this spring.    However, in general plant development was at least threeweeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions variedgreatly by regions, the report said.    Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, andespecially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in goodcondition, with little evidence of winterkill, while othersvaried considerably, the report said.    Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak anduneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in thosefields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said. Reuter&#3;
