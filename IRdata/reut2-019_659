The Federal Reserve Board said itapproved Citicorp's application to purchase through itssubsidiary, Citicorp Savings of Oakland, Calif., some assetsand assume some liabilities of Sears Savings Bank of Glendale,Calif.    Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs indeposits and other liabilities and to purchase 1.9 billion dlrsin assets of 50 branch offices of Sears Savings.    The proposal involved less than one third of the assets andliabilities of Sears Savings, owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co&lt;S>.    The Fed said that it generally has determined there werepotentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banksand savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bankholding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.    It said Citicorp's proposal "properly may be viewed as thepermissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Sand L branches rather than the acquisition of an S and L."    Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed FidelitySavings and Loan Association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrsand operates 86 branches in California, mainly in the north.    Sears Savings has 6.6 billion in assets and 91 branchespredominantly in southern California.    The application, which was approved unanimously, will noteliminate Sears Savings as a competitor, the Fed said. Reuter&#3;
