CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected topay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a shareafter July 1, making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985.    The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 netearnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, againstanalysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.    CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend untillater this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputationto its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-freeto shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which thefull 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.    The company operates on a substituted tax year, not thefiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax atthe 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.    Consequently, it has funds available for distribution withdividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputationlegislation before determining the final payout, it said.    Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a pooryear for the minerals industry, with the notable exception ofgold producers.    Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollarsdeclined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.    Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatilityand uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading tosubstantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.    World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories havesteadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,but overcapacity continues, CRA said.    Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA saidBougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrswhile its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.    Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrsagainst 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.    Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operationsincurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in1985, CRA said.    Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrsagainst 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mlnfrom 2.8 mln.    CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond projectamounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.    CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinaryloss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchangelosses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.    Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided forclosures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase infuture tax provisions, CRA said.    Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrsbefore capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. Thestrong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rightsissue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debtto be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.    CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost. REUTER&#3;
