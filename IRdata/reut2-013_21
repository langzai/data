FCS Laboratories Inc said mergerdiscussions with an unnamed privately-held company in thehealth care field have ended without an agreement.    The previously announced negotiations began last August,the company said.    "It's disappointing to spend so much time on thesenegotiations and have them fail," said FCS chairman NicholasGallo III. "But the discussions could not produce a dealacceptable to our board in the context of the company'sstronger financial position today as compared to six monthsago."    Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential mergerpartners, but will respond to serious inquiries.    "We are determined to follow our plan to restore thiscompany to profitability," he said. "To continue activelysearching for potential acquirers inherently forces us topostpone the implementation of critical decisions which arepart of the plan."    The company, which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding,reaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half ofthe fiscal year ending September 30, 1987. Reuter&#3;
