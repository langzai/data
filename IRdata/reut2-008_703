Indonesia's foreign debts are a causefor concern, but remain within manageable limits, World BankPresident Barber Conable said.    He told a press conference before leaving for Tokyo thatIndonesia's rising debt-service ratio was a problem and causefor concern. But he said it was not necessarily due toimprudent borrowing and "it is still within an area of beingmanageable."    The bank estimates Indonesia has total foreign debts ofaround 37 billion dlrs. The debt service ratio has risen to aprojected 33 pct for fiscal 1987/88, from 25 pct in 1986/87ending March 31.    Anything above 20 pct is considered high by bankers.    Conable said the decline in world oil prices and the risein the value of the Japanese yen had increased the ratio byreducing Indonesian exports and raising its debt repayments.    Indonesian debt servicing of 6,760 billion rupiah takes upalmost one third of the 1987/88 budget.    Payment on the principal of government debts is officiallyprojected at 2.73 billion dlrs in 1987/88 against 2.11 billionin 1986/87.    Conable linked an increase in World Bank lending toIndonesia to implementation of further economic policy reforms. REUTER&#3;
