Australian beef output is forecast todecline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mlnin 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat andLive-Stock Corp (AMLC) said.    Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, andthen rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary ofits bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts.    It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 levelof 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding isexpected to be slower than previously forecast.    Beef producers are becoming more confident that higherreturns in the market, both domestically and overseas, willcontinue, the AMLC said.    The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production isexpected to bring about a slight drop in both export anddomestic consumption this year, it said.    The forecast does not assume a turnaround in productionlevels until late next year.    It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion ofoutput remains much the same as last year when it was around 55pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.    The increase in exports of beef as a percentage ofproduction has mainly been attributed to the decline in theAustralian dollar, the AMLC said.    It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, theU.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate thechilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectivelyaround 94 pct of total Australian exports. REUTER&#3;
