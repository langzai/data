Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe administration still opposes Senate Banking Committeelegislation that would close a key loophole in federal bankinnglaw.    The loophole has spawned a proliferation of limited servicebanks known as non-bank banks that can engage in riskyactivities barred to traditional banks.    Baker has been asked to support the legislation by BankingChairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc).    Proxmire's panel approved closing the loophole in a billrecapitalizing the thrift insurance fund.    Baker said the administration supports moving a billthrough Congress that would address only the recapitalizationissue, for fear such "collateral provisions" as theloophole-closing measure would stall the bill.    Proxmire later told reporters he backs the committee billwith or without administration support.    "I'm going to push it through in any event," he said.    The administration also opposes the committee bill ongrounds it bars new banking powers.    The administration is a long time backer of bankingderegulation. Reuter&#3;
