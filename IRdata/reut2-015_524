India's national foodgrain target hasbeen fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchangedfrom the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in itsannual report for 1986/87.    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterologicalsub-divisions of the country.    The report gave the targets for various crops withestimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grainsincluding sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it waspossible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifyinggrowing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along withgreater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement infertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, addingtotal foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4mln.   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnesof foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-yeardevelopment plan ending March 31, 1990.    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gapof 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining threeyears of the plan by increasing grain output annually by morethan nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only withgood weather, the report said.    "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread ofimproved technology including timely use of inputs (farmmaterials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to bevigrously pursued," it said. Reuter&#3;
