Secretary General Javier Perez deCuellar has proposed an impartial inquiry into the causes ofthe Gulf war while Iran and Iraq observe a ceasefire,diplomatic sources said on Tuesday.    His nine-point plan, a refinement of proposals he took toTehran and Baghdad last month, was delivered to the two sideslast week with a request that they let him have their initialviews before October 30.    The proposals appeared to counter Iran's earlier offer ofan undeclared cessation of hostilities if an inquiry intoresponsibility for the war was begun.    Iraq insisted on a formal unconditional ceasefire, Perez deCuellar told the Security Council on his return to New York onSeptember 16.    As in his original proposals, the revised plan termed D-daya specific date to be agreed upon for the observance of aceasefire, diplomats said.    On a specific date after that, which would have to beagreed, the withdrawal of all forces to internationallyrecognized boundaries would begin and be completed within anagreed time frame, according to the account of his proposals.
