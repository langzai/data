Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak."    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of "over-production and price interventionin the developed nations."
