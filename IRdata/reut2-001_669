Former White House spokesman LarrySpeakes said he and President Reagan misled the publicunintentionally on the Iran arms scandal because theythemselves were misled by others.    In a televised interview, Speakes was contrasting thedefensive, much-criticized efforts Reagan made in earlyattempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech heexpected when the president addressed the nation tonight.    "When we went into those press conferences and thatnationwide address in November right after the (Iran) storybroke, the president did not have the proper information,"Speakes said.    "And that's why we were misled. And consequently, thepresident and I misled the public, to a certain extent."    "We were badly served by the people that were involved inthe Iranian crisis and running the show."    Asked whom he meant, Speakes said former National SecurityAdviser Robert McFarlane; McFarlane successor John Poindexter;and then-National Security Council aide Oliver North.    Speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology ofevents "that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts..."    McFarlane has said that he, North and Poindexter haddoctored a White House chronology to obscure and minimizeReagan's role in the arms sales. He said they did that as partof an effort to prepare the president for a November 19 newsconference. Reuter&#3;
