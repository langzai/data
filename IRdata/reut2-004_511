Japan Fund Inc said its board wouldrecommend at its April 23 stockholders meeting that the Fund beconverted to a no-load open-end fund.    If approved, the Fund said a redemption fee of one pct ofnet asset value will be imposed on redemptions for a period oftime not to exceed six months after open-ending.    It said such a redemption fee is designed to covertrasaction costs related to early redemptions and will remainin the assets of the Fund.    It said Shearson Lehman Brothers is serving as itsfinancial advisor.    In a prepared statement, Jonathan Mason, Japan Fund'schairman, said "open-ending, which is timely, given theexpansion of the Japanese stock markets, particularly in thelast few years, will eliminate the discount from net assetvalue and will afford investors the continuing opportunity forinvestment in Japan through the Japan Fund."    Japan Fund said it proposed the conversion to an open-endfund after rejecting a takeover offer of about 525 mln dlrsfrom an investment group led by T. Boone Pickens III, son ofthe Texas oilman.    The investor group, whose other members include &lt;SterlingGrace Capital Fund LP> and &lt;Anglo American Security Fund LP>,could not be reached tonight for comment.    When it made its takeover offer on March 3, the group saidit owned 1.4 mln shares, or about 4.9 pct, of the fund'soutstanding stock.    Asked to comment on the rejection of the investor group'soffer, a Japan Fund spokeswoman said, "The board decided thatan open-end fund was preferable."    The spokeswoman, Davia B. Temin, said no other commentswould be made on the offer.    She also declined to provide details on other options JapanFund said previously that it would consider along with thetakeover bid.
