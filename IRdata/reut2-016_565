OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutinyin coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies ofoil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabassaid.    In an article headlined, "Gulf oil sources say Middle Eastproduction up 1.4 mln bpd," it warned OPEC's official pricescould face fresh pressure from international oil companiesseeking cheaper supplies.    It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and otherproducers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nordid it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.    "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come underfresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in theEuropean and American markets," the daily said.    The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had inMarch demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, somemembers had raised output last week. It gave no details.    "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec wasable to control production, or whether the days of cheating andproducing over quotas has begun anew," it said.    The sources warned that "maybe the (price of a) barrel ofoil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next ifthere is no control on supplies," it said.    "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrelmay open the doors for international oil companies to pressureOPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,"it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to liftfrom Qatar unless it gave price discounts.    "More than one official has warned OPEC would find itssolidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,"it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer. Reuter&#3;
