A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire.    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations.    TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto.    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary.    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said.    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added.    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward," he said.    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's.    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.    However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. Reuter&#3;
