Fritz Leutwiler, chairman ofBBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bankpresident, urged the National Bank to declare its intent ofachieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, "A graduallyrising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would bedesirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and withregard to sustaining Swiss industry."    "Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank ofissue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect," hesaid.    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss centralbank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank'starget of monetary stability.    "Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, haveto be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetarypolicy," he told shareholders. "Realistically there is in fact nopersuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20pct lower than the Swiss."    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark andSwiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over along period of time.    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influenceindividual parities separately.    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not supportthe value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other centralbanks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.    "I would be the last to recommend that. The key to astronger dollar lies in the United States itself," Leutwilersaid. REUTER&#3;
