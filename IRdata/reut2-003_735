Martin Sosnoff, who has offered tobuy Caesars World Inc for 28 dlrs a share, said seniorofficials of the company have offered to buy back the Caesarsstake he already holds, now 13.6 pct of the total outstanding.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said the offersto buy back his stock occurred "on several occasions during thepast year."    The offers were made by several Caesars Worldrepresentatives, including its chairman, Henry Gluck, he said.    Sosnoff said he rejected all of the proposals.    The Caesars World official suggested various forms ofpayment for Sosnoff's stake, including other securities of thecompany and cash, he said. Sosnoff did not detail the value ofthe proposed compensation.    Also suggested was a deal involving "put" and "call" optionregarding Sosnoff's Caesars World holdings, he said.    The proposed deals would have also included a "standstill"agreement, which would have restricted Sosnoff's right to buymore Caesars World stock or "to take any action adverse toincumbent management," he said.    Sosnoff's report on the offers he received for his CaesarsWorld shares were amended to his official offer to purchase thecompany, as well as reported to the SEC.    Sosnoff now holds about 4.1 mln Caesars World shares, or13.6 pct of the company's 30 mln shares outstanding.    The Sosnoff offer to buy the shares of the company he doesnot already hold has been valued at 725.2 mln dlrs. Reuter&#3;
