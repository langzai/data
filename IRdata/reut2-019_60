Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez throughC.Itoh.    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Lightfrom Iraq have not been finalised yet because of severalconstraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcelsand proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port wherelifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOCthen proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port fordelivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo tooffload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.
