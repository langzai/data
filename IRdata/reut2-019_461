New Zealand's opposition NationalParty said it would cut personal and business taxes and wouldnot regulate or control interest rates if returned to power.    The economic strategy was unveiled by party leader JimBolger one day before prime minister David Lange announces thedate of general elections, widely expected to be August 15.    The National Party's tax policies included the abolition ofdeath and gift duties and the removal of indirect taxes onbasic food and doctors' fees.    The most recent opinion poll, taken on June 20, gave Laboura 26 point lead over National or eight points more than a monthearlier.    National said that under its administration the New Zealanddollar would find its level with "complementary fiscal andmonetary policies." The party did not elaborate.    Controversy over National's economic policy erupted inMarch when former prime minister Robert Muldoon said the partyhad adopted a policy of a managed exchange rate.    Bolger said then that the National Party would continue tofloat the dollar.    Since the dollar was floated by the Labour Party in March1985 it has risen about 34 pct, cutting the export incomes offarmers, who are traditional National Party supporters.    The party said tight monetary policies alone would lead tounrealistic exchange rates which would be out of line forexporters unless they were supported by a low governmentborrowing requirement, a shrinking government sector andpositive growth.    It aimed to keep aspects of deregulation which havebenefitted New Zealanders while cutting government spending,unemployment, interest rates, inflation and tax.    The National Party intends to privatise totally the &lt;Bankof New Zealand>, &lt;Development Finance Corporation>, &lt;TouristHotel Corporation>, &lt;Petrocorp>, &lt;State Insurance> and&lt;Government Life Office>, the party said.    Other candidates for privatisation, such as &lt;Air NewZealand Ltd>, would be considered when the share market couldabsorb them. REUTER&#3;
