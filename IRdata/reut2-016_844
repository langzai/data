General Motors Corp's executive salarybonus plan, effective since 1918, was out of date for theworld's largest automaker's changing corporate strategy,executive vice president Robert Stempel said.    "The bonus plan was a plan that was really in sync with amanufacturing organization selling what it builds," Stempel toldreporters at New York Auto Show's press opening.    Commenting on GM's previously announced move to replace theexecutive bonus-system with a stock option plan, Stempel saidthe old system did not fit with the company's strategy of longterm capital investment.    "We need to make sure that our pay system is in linewith...the long term enhancing of the value of the stock, andwe think that the new program will be doing just that for us,"GM's Stempel said in response to a reporter's question.    Stempel voiced confidence that GM shareholders will approvethe new plan, outlined in a shareholder proxy statement issuedThursday.    Stempel also said General Motors will reduce 10 pct of itscomponent business by 1990, for savings of about 500 mln dlrs.GM plans to "eliminate those units that are clearly defined asnon-competitive in the components business," he said.
