Credit Suisse &lt;CRSZ.Z> has been orderedto freeze accounts thought to have been involved in a U.S.Insider trading scandal, a Justice Ministry spokesman said.    Joerg Kistler said the accounts belonged to two individualsand three companies, including Nahum Vaskevitch, former head ofthe London office of Merrill Lynch and Co &lt;MER.N>.    The accounts were blocked under a treaty on legalassistance between the United States and Switzerland aimed atfacilitating criminal investigations which might otherwiseremain hidden because of Swiss banking secrecy.    The order prohibits transactions on the accounts for aninitial period of 30 days, after an emergency request from theUnited States arrived last Friday.    The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whichsupervises stock market trading, alleged this month thatVaskevitch and an Israeli associate, Daniel Sofer, were behindan insider trading ring which netted profits of four mln dlrs.    The order freezes accounts owned by Vaskevitch and Sofer aswell as those of the companies &lt;Plenmeer Ltd> and &lt;MedaEstablishment>, Kistler said. He declined to name the thirdcompany, since it was not clear what role it played.    A spokesman for the bank said he was aware of the order."Now we have to find out what is on the accounts," he said. Hedeclined to give further details.    The SEC alleged in a New York court last week that Sofertransferred 1.9 million dollars from a U.S. Bank account of thecompany Plenmeer to an account at Credit Suisse. REUTER&#3;
