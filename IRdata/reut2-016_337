Chemical New York Corp said itsfirst-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mlndlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring theBrazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs inlost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrsfrom 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise wasmainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth inconsumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofmedium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are notresumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for thewhole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador onnon-accrual because the Quito government also suspendedinterest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interestincome by 1.5 mln dlrs.    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrsfrom 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from3.96 pct.    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, areduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculationof the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) anda narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical'scost of funds.    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrsfrom 26.2 mln.    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, comparedwith 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs atquarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billiondlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end ofMarch, 1986. Reuter&#3;
