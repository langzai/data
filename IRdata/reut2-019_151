Sudan has set aside 781.6 mln dlrs toservice foreign debts in 1987/88, according to budget planspresented to parliament.    This compares with 200 mln dlrs earmarked for debtrepayment in the year ending June 30. Sudan has a foreign debttotalling 10.6 billion dlrs.    Finance Minister Beshir Omar, presenting plans toparliament last night, put the budget deficit at 2.88 billionpounds, against 2.85 billion in 1986/87.    He said the budget would be the first in a four-yeareconomic recovery plan to be announced by the end of December.    Of the total set aside for debt servicing, Omar said 574.6mln dlrs would go to principal and 207 mln to interestpayments.    Sudan has an annual debt liability of 900 mln dlrs,Khartoum-based Western experts say.    Omar said last March it would be difficult, "if notimpossible," for Sudan to meet scheduled debt repayments of 4.17billion dlrs over the next five years.    He said last night Sudan was 2.6 billion dlrs in arrears ondebt repayments in the first half of this year.    The experts say Sudan owes 23 pct of its foreign debt toWestern government creditors, 32 pct to governments of Easternbloc and Arab countries and 21 pct to commercial banks, withmost of the rest owed to multilateral sources.    Sudan, unable to fully service its debts since 1985 anddeclared ineligible last year by the International MonetaryFund for fresh loans, has been servicing only creditors bannedfrom extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.    Omar said government revenue in 1987/88 would total 3.9billion pounds. Expenditure was put at 6.79 billion pounds.    He said the budget deficit would be fully covered by loans,government deposits and other sources.    Omar said 375 mln pounds would be spent on subsidisingsugar and wheat flour prices in 1987/88.    He said some of Sudan's Western backers were witholding aiduntil an agreement with the IMF was reached.    Sudan, which owes the IMF 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears,is scheduled to hold fresh talks with the Fund in late July orAugust on reforming its economy and clearing arrears. REUTER&#3;
