The Soviet Union's first officialobserver at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said he came awayfrom this week's ADB annual meeting with a favourableimpression but that no decision has been made on whether theSoviet Union should join as a full member.    Yurij V. Ponomarev, international managing director of theState Bank, said he will file a formal report when he returnsto Moscow, but it will not contain any recommendation onmembership. "We haven't started any process with a view towardmembership," he said.    Ponomarev downplayed the significance of his attendance,saying it only signalled a slight change in attitude by Moscow.Although this is the first time Moscow has attended the ADB'sannual meeting as an observer, Soviet bankers have come tomeetings in the past as guests, he said.    Delegates here saw the Soviet move as part of an overallstrategy to strengthen ties with Asia and improve thefunctioning of the Soviet economy.    Ponomarev declined to comment on remarks yesterday by asenior U.S. Official, who warned that Soviet membership in theADB would cause serious operational problems.    "How would the ADB, for instance, use the (Soviet) rouble asa basis for expanding its capital?" asked the U.S. Official, whodeclined to be identified.    Ponomarev said: "It is far too premature to speculate on thepotential difficulties that might be involved if we applied formembership."    In order to become a member, Moscow would have to gain thebacking of two-thirds of the board of governors representingthree-quarters of the voting power of member countries.Washington has just over a 12 pct voting share.
