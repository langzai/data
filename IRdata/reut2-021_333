The Philippine Senate approved a proposalto repay loans owed by a private company to speed up thesigning of a 13.2 billion dlr rescheduling agreement withforeign banks.    It concerns a Barclays Bank managed loan to fertilizercompany Planter Products Inc, said Teofisto Paterno, chairmanof the foreign debt committee.    President Corazon Aquino had accused some creditor banks of"non-too-subtle coercion" in threatening to refuse to sign therescheduling accord until the loan problem was settled.    Over 30 of Philippines' 483 creditor banks still have tosign the agreement before the November 15 deadline. REUTER&#3;
