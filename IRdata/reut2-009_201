Brazil and its bank creditors failed toachieve any breakthrough in debt talks here last night afterBrazil refused to say when it would resume interest payments.    Central Bank governor Francisco Gros said after a meetingwith a 14-bank advisory committee that Brazil cannot make anyinterest payments at this time, though it would do so "as soonas we can."    The talks came as the annual meeting of the 44-nationInter-American Development Bank (IADB), in which both Gros andthe bankers had been taking part, moved toward a close here.    Bankers leaving the meeting with Gros declined to discussdetails of the talks, though some expressed satisfaction thatBrazil had agreed to continue working with the committee.    At the same time, Gros told reporters not to expect anydramatic developments before March 31, the date when some U.S.banks have said they will take a decision whether to put Brazilloans on a non-performing basis.    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrforeign debt to commercial banks on February 20 and shortlyafter announced it was freezing some 16 billion dlrs inshort-term credit lines.    Banks are not obliged to declare these loans non-performingbefore 90 days have elapsed, but the move to announce apossible decision in this respect was viewed as a means ofexerting pressure on Brazil.    The bank committee, headed by Citibank, had been pressingBrazil to make at least a token payment of interest but Grossaid this was not possible right now.    "We are not in a position to make a payment at this stage,"Gros said.    At the same time, the two sides reached a stopgaparrangement on the short-term trade and money-market creditlines, whereby the committee agreed to transmit a Brazilianrequest to extend the lines for 60 days until May 31.    Banks have been indicating they will not renew credit linesin response to the Brazilian move. Reuter&#3;
