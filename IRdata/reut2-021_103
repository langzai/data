Head of the Chamber of Commerce's Moneyand Credit section, Hellmuth Klauhs, said the government shouldguarantee any company debts arising from the plannedrestructuring of the public sector.    Klauhs said that there was no doubt that the governmentwould meet its obligations. "But the owner should say thisclearly once again," he added.    Klauhs said 35 billion of 61 billion schillings owed byfirms under the state holding &lt;OesterreichischeIndustrieholding AG> (OIAG) currently had no formal stateguarantee. Nine of the 35 billion schillings were owed toforeign banks.    Klauhs, also managing director of &lt;GenossenschaftlicheZentralbank AG>, said banking industry officials would discussthe issue with finance minister Ferdinand Lacina next month.    Lacina said last week a special guarantee would beunnecessary, as state industry had the financial power andenough liquidity to pay its debts.    The government has said the latest injection of state fundsinto OIAG to cover losses will be the last.    Under a restructuring plan, OIAG is to create five newholding companies divided by sector.
