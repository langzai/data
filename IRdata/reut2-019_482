Bahrain's 19 commercial banks have beeninstructed by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) to return to asix day working week with effect from July 4.    A circular sent to the banks today reverses a shift inearly April to a five day week and follows three months ofcontroversy within the domestic banking sector over hours.    A BMA spokesman said the circular, which does not affectoffshore banks, represented a "compromise solution" betweendiffering views within the industry and was drawn up followingthe agency's own survey of banks, staff and customers.    In April the BMA allowed commercial banks to operate a fiveday week from Sunday to Thursday. Banks have since been closedon Fridays, the Islamic weekend, and Saturdays.    The new regulation will require banks to work from 7.30A.M. To 12 noon from Saturday to Thursday inclusive. Banks mayopen on these days during the afternoon between 3.30 and 5.30.    The regulations apply to bank opening hours, not to staffworking hours, which continue to be decided by banks.    Under the five day week introduced in early April, bankshave been obliged to open from 8 A.M. Until noon and from 3.30to 5.30 P.M. REUTER&#3;
