Security Pacific Corp said it isplacing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on anon-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce firstquarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, aftertaxes.    Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarterearnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per sharereported for the first quarter of 1986.    The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mlndlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrsof medium- and long-term debt on February 20.    Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billiondlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks sinceFebruary.    In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest paymentsfor the rest of the year because of an earthquake which haltedthe export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct thecountry's export revenues.    In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will recordinterest income only as it is received in cash.    The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach anagreement with its banks and that interest payments will resumelater in 1987.    The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New Yorkwhen Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to askbanks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of termdebt that matures on April 15.
