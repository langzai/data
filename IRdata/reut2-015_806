The House Armed Services Committeehas voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiledmaterials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity andquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Billwhich will be voted on in the House next month.    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told Reuters.    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by beingmanaged properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpileover the last 10 years has been atrocious."    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to aWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.    The staffer said that under the measures passed by thecommittee the Secretary of Defense would have more influenceover decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budgetand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpilemanagement was counter-productive, he said. Reuter&#3;
