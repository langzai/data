Senior U.S. Arms control officialssaid they were optimistic the United States and Soviet Unioncould reach agreement on ways to verify a pact to eliminatemedium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.    Chief U.S. Arms control negotiator Max Kampelman said onthe NBC television network a fair pact would be hard tonegotiate, but, "We are determined to do it."    Assistant Secretary of Defence for international securitypolicy Richard Perle said he thought the two sides could agreeon a method to ensure each side was honouring a missile pact.    President Reagan said on Friday that Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz would go to Moscow next month for talks on armscontrol and a possible U.S.-Soviet summit meeting.    The decision to send Shultz to Moscow followed anannouncement by Soviet leader Mikhael Gorbachev that he waswilling to separate elimination of medium-range missiles inEurope from his demand for curbs on U.S. Development of aStrategic Defence Initiative (SDI) anti-missile system.    Kampelman said the United States and the Soviet Union bothhad a general definition of so-called "intrusive" or on-siteinspection of a pact, but details would be tough to work out. Reuter&#3;
