More leading U.S. manufacturers plan toincrease the proportion of their U.S.-based productionvis-a-vis their overseas output over the next two years,according to a Boston University School of Management survey.    The Manufacturing Roundtable 1987 study showed 32 pct ofmanufacturers plan to shift output to their domestic plantsfrom their overseas ones, or simply increase the production intheir U.S. plants.    That was up from 19 pct expecting to make that shift in1986, and only 12 pct in 1984.    The Boston University survey canvassed 207 firms.    The largest group of those surveyed, 44 pct, planned nochanges in their U.S./overseas operations, while 23.7 pct saidthey would boost the ratio of overseas output, the poll said.    Jeffrey Miller, professor at the School of Management anddirector of the Roundtable Survey, said that exchange ratesfavored plans toward increased domestic production. But headded that increased competitiveness seems to be behind themove towards greater production in the United States.    "What's peculiar about this group is that it's the mostsuccessful in terms of profitability, decreasing costs, andincreasing quality," he told Reuters in an interview.    Those companies increasing offshore production are at theopposite end of the spectrum, he said, not meeting theproduction goals they set for themselves.    He cautioned that the survey was skewed towards large,unusually profitable businesses representing a diversity ofindustries and regions. The typical respondent was a largemanufacturing division with sales of about 200 mln dlrs.    Reuter&#3;
