The West German Government will be askedJune 16 to provide nearly 850 million marks (470 milliondollars) to lay off or retrain 20,000 steel workers whose jobsare threatened by the recent slump in the country's steelindustry.    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor HelmutKohl will review a joint proposal by steel employers and tradeunions at a meeting on the ailing industry tomorrow.    Both steel employers and union leaders are expected to tellKohl tomorrow that the Government has failed to do enough toprotect German steel firms from subsidies and unfaircompetition from other European Community members.    Government sources said Bonn was prepared to take part in acommon effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. Butsince the Government is struggling to finance tax cuts byslashing state subsidies, it is not prepared to pick up thewhole bill for the layoffs, the sources said.    A spokesman for IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union,said the proposal seeks redundancy payments to 10,000 workersin Ruhr and Rhineland plants. Some 6,000 workers would beredeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies,while a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retrainingschemes.    The union estimates that the redundancy payments wouldtotal 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while jobretraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130million dollars).    Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the nextfew years following steep losses incurred by the industry sincemid-1986.    Extensive restructuring of the industry in recent years wasunable to compensate for the effects of the weak dollar whichdepressed foreign demand for steel, industry sources said. Reuter&#3;
