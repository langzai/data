Geodome Resources Ltd saidfollowing receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co'sStearns Catalytic unit it will proceed with construction andpre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County,Idaho, as quickly as possible.    The company said the study found proven ore reserves of3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. Itsaid the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore peryear, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first threeyears for a rapid payback of capital costs.    It said the feasibility study calls for gold productionaveraging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000ounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life.    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipmentand 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, the firmsaid. It said the mine would be operated by a contract minerbut the associated mill by Geodome.    Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is notincluded in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nineholes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce ofgold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton.    Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-gradematerial that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton forgold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price.    Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for thefirst three years, in constant dollars. Reuter&#3;
