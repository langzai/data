Federal Home Loan Bank Boardchairman Edwin Gray said pending bills do not provide enoughmoney for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp to dealwith insolvent thrift associations.    The Senate has passed a bill to provide 7.5 billion dlrs inFSLIC recapitalization, while the House Banking Committee hasapproved five billion dlrs in new funds.    "We are operating right now on net operating losses of fourbillion dlrs a year. That's double last year. We think it'sgoing to increase," Gray told a Senate Appropriationssubcommittee hearing.    "The FSLIC is insolvent under generally accepted accountingprocedures and it lacks the financial resources tocost-effectively resolve its caseload of insolventinstitutions," Gray said.    Gray said FSLIC now had 191 cases and the number wasexpected to increase.    He said the gap between the 80 pct of healthy savingsassociations and the other 20 pct of thrifts grew in 1986.    Banking committee chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis, toldGray he supported more recapitalization, but other members didnot want to impose a greater burden on healthy thrifts. Reuter&#3;
