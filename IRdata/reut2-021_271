British Sugar Plc was forced to shut itsIpswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acuteshortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to aReuter inquiry    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combinationof very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in thefactory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week'shurricane which blocked roads.    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads arecleared and supplies of beet build up again.    This is the first time in many years that a factory hasbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by BritishSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a yearout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvestingproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintainingits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, thespokesman said.    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factoriesnormally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during thecampaign.    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had beenharvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather hasseverely restricted beet lifting.    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yetavailable. Reuter&#3;
