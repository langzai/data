IBM Deutschland GmbH &lt;IBM.F>, theWest German subsidiary of International Business Machines Corp&lt;IBM.N>, said its turnover fell nine pct to 12.0 billion marksin 1986 as a result of currency factors, weaker demand in thesecond half and stiff price competition.    IBM Deutschland planned to strengthen its software andservice activities in future to ensure growth remained atdesired levels in the medium term, managing board chairmanHans-Olaf Henkel said. He gave no 1986 profit figures.    Domestic turnover fell 12.7 pct to 7.2 billion marks whileexports declined 3.2 pct to 4.8 billion.    Most of IBM Deutschland's exports go to IBM companies inother countries.    Henkel said volume sales had been positive overall,especially in the large computer and personal computer sectors.However, at the same time, fierce international competition,worldwide overcapacity and currency movements had reduced largecomputer prices for IBM Deutschland by some 23 pct.
