U.S. credit markets opened lower,undercut by a weaker dollar, dealers said.    The impetus for the opening declines came from overseastrading, where a lack of retail buying led to profit-takingthat erased yesterday's moderate gains, dealers said.    Most investors have stepped to the sidelines to await theoutcome of this week's monetary meetings in Washington and tosee how it affects exchange rates, they added.    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond opened 17/32 lower at95-22/32 to yield 7.88 pct compared with 7.84 pct atyesterday's close. It fell to 95-26/32 in late Tokyo trade.    "How the bond market trades seems to be a mirror image ofhow the dollar/yen trades," a dealer said. "As the dollar goes,so goes the market, but so far we're just bouncing around inthin trading."    Skepticism that this week's monetary meetings of leadingindustrial nations in Washington will produce substantiveagreements to ease trade tensions between the U.S. and Japanand take pressure off the dollar is weighing on bond prices.    "I can't imagine that anything of much substance couldcomoe out of these meetings other than a reiteration ofprevious statements," a dealer said.    Dealers said U.S. government securities prices will bevulnerable as long as further dollar declines are expected.    The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/16 to 99-20/32 at theopening and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 11/32 to 97-25/32.    Treasury bill rates rose in early trading, pulled higher insympathy with the rise in coupon yields.    Three-month bills were unchanged from yesterday's auctionprice at 5.53 pct bid, while six-month bills rose six basispoints from their auction price to 5.69 pct bid.    Year bills rose four basis points to 5.77 pct bid.    The Federal funds rate opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained atthis level in early trading. It averaged 6.20 pct yesterday.    Economists said seasonal pressures on bank reserves pointto a possible indirect injection of temporary reserves by theFederal Reserve this morning. Some look for the Fed to purchasecoupon securities this afternoon.    Dealers said the market may take its next cue from FederalReserve chairman Paul Volcker's Congressional testimony at 1000EDT (1400 GMT) this morning. Reuter&#3;
