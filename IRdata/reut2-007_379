Asea Group, the diversified industrialconcern based in Vasteras, Sweden, said it expects 1987earnings, after financial income and expense, to be flatcompared with 1986, when it earned 2.53 billion Swedish crowns,or 371.1 mln dlrs.    A company spokesman said 1986 results were boostedsignificantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclearpower plants.    This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return toprofitability by Asea's power transmission segment, which had aloss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.    Currency conversions were made at 6.81 crowns to the dlr.    The spokesman said the company has built up a strongbacklog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 andbeyond.    At yearend 1986, Asea's order backlog stood at 32.7 billioncrowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5billion dlrs, at the end of 1985.
