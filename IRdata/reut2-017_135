The most likely reason for West Germanproducers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores isthat they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtainingEuropean Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said.    They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brusselssaying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1.    The traders said it is also likely that French producers,who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw asignificant proportion of this for the same reason before theyare due to accept payment for the sugar in early May.    Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the levelof export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders,with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats toleave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most ofthe old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May.    The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes outof around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of hightonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders andsubsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bidsfor the export licences, traders said.
