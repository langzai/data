NYNEX Corp will urge the U.S.District Court to approve Justice Department recommendationseasing restrictions on offering new services by regionaltelephone firms, chairman Delbert Staley said.    "While NYNEX would have prefered the unqualified lifting ofall of the Modified Final Judgement restrictions, we intend tourge Judge (Harold) Greene to act as quickly as possible toapprove the recommendations," Staley told a news conference.    NYNEX will file its comments with the U.S. District Courton Friday, he said.    Staley referred to Justice Department recommendations toGreene last month that restrictions on manufacturing,information services and out-of-region, long-distance servicebe eliminated.    Referring to information services, Staley said, "Thatcertainly is one area we would quickly move into."    Electronic mail, voice mail and videotext are some of theservices NYNEX could offer, he added.    NYNEX disagreed with the department's recommendation toretain restrictions on long-distance service within a localservice region, Staley said.    The company would like to have the option of providinglong-distance service within and outside its region, he said.    "Our entry in long-distance would further stimulatecompetition," Staley said.    "We believe it would put downward pressure on consumercosts."    Reuter&#3;
