Moody's Investors Service Inc said itput Hospital Corp of America's nearly three billion dlrs oflong-term debt under review with uncertain direction.    Under review are the A-2 senior debt, A-3 convertiblesubordinated debt and Prime-2 commercial paper ratings.    Moody's cited the firm's planned sale of 104 U.S.-basedhospitals to an employee stock ownership plan. The cost wouldbe 1.8 billion dlrs in cash plus preferred stock and warrants.    Moody's expects favorable credit implications if the saleincludes low-profit hospitals. Reducing Hospital's financialleverage will be needed to maintain credit quality, it said. Reuter&#3;
