Consumer countries should notintervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.    "Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands ofproducers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at therecent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "When consumerswant to get involved, talks are much more difficult."    The main consumer country the United States and mainproducer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distributionwhen the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met inFebruary.    Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London inSeptember will be to support the world coffee pact, defend itsmarket share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in thehands of producer countries.    "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this yearwe have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and weare not in a position to do favours." Reuter&#3;
