The decision by Paul Volcker not to servea third term as chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is ashock for financial markets and the world economy, Hans Mast,senior economic adviser to Credit Suisse First Boston, said.    "The markets will believe there will be pressure for a moreexpansive policy (in the United States)," he said.    "I would say this is quite a shock for the world economy," headded. "He always stood for an anti-inflationary policy andtight fiscal discipline. He was one of the best central bankersAmerica has had."    Mast said the markets would now be trying to assess whatsort of direction the Fed would be taking under Alan Greenspan,designated to succeed Volcker.    "Greenspan is more of a politician than an academician, butthe most important thing is that he has little experience inbanking," Mast said.    Greenspan's first comments on being named were that thedollar appeared to have bottomed out, but Mast said thatconviction would have to be backed by policy. "How can you saythe dollar has bottomed out with the present level of currentaccount deficits?" he said. "I would be sceptical." Reuter&#3;
