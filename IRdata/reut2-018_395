Treasurer Paul Keating said he nowexpected the Australian current account deficit for fiscal1986/87 ending June 30 to come in around 13.25 billion dlrs.    In a statement released after Statistics Bureau figuresshowed the May deficit was below forecasts at 866 mln dlrs,Keating said the cumulative deficit is now likely to be about1.5 billion dlrs below the Treasury forecast of 14.75 billionissued with the 1986/87 Budget papers last August.    However, the government had subsequently revised theforecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of currentaccount figures indicated a declining trend.    Keating's revised 1986/87 current account deficit forecastcompares with a record shortfall of 14.40 billion dlrs in1985/86, a level nearly double the 7.29 billion deficitrecorded only two years earlier in 1983/84.    Keating said the main reason for his revision was abetter-than-expected export performance. Recent quarterlyfigures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year toMarch 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct, he said.    The Bureau data issued today showed the cumulative deficitfor the first 11 months of 1986/87 narrowed to 12.32 billiondlrs from 13.21 billion a year earlier. REUTER&#3;
