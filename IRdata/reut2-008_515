Jill Considine, New York StateSuperintendent of Banks, said a federal banking bill proposalnow before the Senate, which includes a moratorium on newnon-bank activities by bank holding companies, would preemptstate banking authority.    "This bill purports to freeze the 'status quo' of bankingbut in fact only magnifies the existing competitiveinequalities and places a strait-jacket on the ability ofstates to permit banks to diversify their services and expandgeographically," Considine said in a statement.    "This bill is antithetical to the concept of the dualbanking system, which encourages states to experiment andinnovate," she added. Reuter&#3;
