Public opinion polls showing a surge insupport for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher followingher trip to Moscow have raised the possibility she will call aspring election, political analysts said.    A poll in today's Daily Express showed 39 pct support forthe ruling Conservative party, 30 pct for the Alliance ofLiberals and Social Democrats and 29 pct for the Labour party.    Reproduced in a general election, the result would giveThatcher an overall parliamentary majority of 22.    A poll in yesterday's Sunday Times gave the Conservatives41 pct support, 12 percentage points ahead of both oppositiongroups -- their biggest lead in three-and-a-half years.    Conservative sources have said Thatcher would prefer aseries of polls giving her party over 40 pct of the vote,securing it a clear parliamentary majority, before announcingthe date for the next election.    Lord Whitelaw, Conservative leader in the House of Lordsand one of Thatcher's closest advisors, yesterday ruled out aMay general election, but left open the choices of June andearly autumn.    The Sunday Times poll, taken during Thatcher's visit toMoscow last week, was the first to show the party breakingthrough 40 pct.    The Express poll was the first since Thatcher's trip toMoscow, hailed as a triumph by the British media. It confirmeda number of recent surveys suggesting that the Alliance hadovertaken Labour.    Thatcher, currently serving her second consecutive term ofoffice, does not have to call elections until June 1988 but iswidely expected to do so within the next six months. REUTER&#3;
