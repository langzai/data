Ashland Oil Inc is actively seeking achemical acquisition and is willing to spend between 100 to 200mln dlrs, Chairman John Hall said.    "We're looking for privately held companies or units ofother companies. We think it's too dificult to go (shopping) onthe stock market where premiums are so high," Hall toldReuters. He was in Houston to address the annual meeting of theAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers.    "We're trying to grow in that area to cushion the oil pricevolatility," Hall said.    Hall said Ashland is seeking a chemical company acquisitionwhich would complement its existing chemical businesses whichmanufacture adhesives, polyester resins and other products.    When asked if Ashland is considering divesting itsmoney-losing oil exploration and production unit, he said "wedo not have any spin-offs planned at this time."    Hall said the Ashland, Ky., based oil company would havestrong margins on its chemical products throughout 1987, adding"right now we're struggling a bid" with the company's refiningand marketing margins.    The Ashland chairman also said he hoped the U.S. governmentwould consider some form of tax incentive to help developcostly synthetic fuels such as oil shales and coalliquification. "The lead time on that (kind of project) is solong, it's difficult for a private company or a company withshareholders to pay for reseach," he explained. Reuter&#3;
