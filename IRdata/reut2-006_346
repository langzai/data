Sony will have an irregular five-month business term endingMarch 31, as its financial year will be changed to run fromApril 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.

The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recentappreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in marketprices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.

Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from onemln due to lower exports to China.    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrssales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the threemonths compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its totalproduction in 1990 from the present 20 pct.    Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-monthperiod is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct froma year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.
