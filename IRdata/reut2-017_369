West Germany's current accountsurplus widened to a provisional 8.8 billion marks in Marchfrom a slightly downwards revised 6.5 billion in February, aspokesman for the Federal Statistics Office said.    The trade surplus fell to a provisional 10.1 billion marksfrom 10.4 billion in February.    The Statistics Office had earlier put the February currentaccount surplus at a provisional 6.6 billion marks. Theprovisional February trade surplus was confirmed.    The Office said the March trade surplus had also risenstrongly from the year-ago month total of 8.5 billion marks,while the March current account surplus compared with only 4.3billion marks a year earlier.    The figures given by the office show nominal trade flows,but an office statement said that the current account surplushad also risen in real terms from February.    However, it attributed this partly to the fact thatpayments to the European Community had been brought forward inFebruary, with the result that transfers abroad in March wereunusually low.    The Statistics Office said March imports totalled 36.93billion marks, a rise of 15 pct from February and of 4.7 pctcompared with March 1986.    March exports of 47.06 billion marks were 11 pct higherthan in February and 7.6 pct higher than in March last year.    Other data reported in the current account balance showedthere was a 400 mln mark deficit in supplementary trade items,a 500 mln mark deficit in the services account and a 400 mlnmark deficit in transfer payments.
