The Bank of England said it had invitedan early round of bill offers from the discount houses afterforecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg.    Money market dealers speculated that the central bank couldbe taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Baselending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes inthe discount market.    Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today,possibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in whichthe U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashedby three billion stg.    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturingin official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drainsome 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation andbankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stgand 20 mln stg respectively.    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactionswill add some 140 mln stg to the system today. REUTER&#3;
