New Zealand's budget deficit forfiscal 1986/87 ending March 31 is expected to be around thebudget forecast of 2.45 billion N.Z. Dlrs but below a Decemberforecast of 2.91 billion, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.    The 1985/86 budget deficit was 1.87 billion dlrs.    "It is clear now that the March tax flow has beenconsiderably stronger than expected in some areas, particularlyprovisional and terminal tax..," Douglas said in a statement.    Overall tax revenue is now expected to be around 600 mlndlrs above forecast, though there is some uncertainty aboutrevenue from the final goods and services tax and March incometax payments, he added.    "Net expenditure also appears to be tracking to end-of-yearforecast with the expectation that over-expenditure in someareas will be offset by under-expenditure in others," he added. REUTER&#3;
