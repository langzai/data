The International Tin Council, ITC,intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent thepresentation of internal Council documents as evidence.    The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against theLondon Metal Exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in whichthe Council is involved following the collapse of its bufferstock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.    The ITC's case is being presented by Professor RosalynHiggins and is expected to take a further one or two days nextweek. Court does not sit tomorrow.    In essence the Council is claiming that its status issimilar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives cantherefore not be used in an English court of law.    The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead ofschedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrowwhen the European Community's legal advisers were due toattend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the variouslegal actions today.    Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internaladministrative matters, delegates said.    The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff afterJune 30 following the two year extension of the sixthInternational Tin Agreement.    As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Councilwill continue with its statistical work and carry out someresearch studies, although staffing in the research departmentis being cut to one from two previously.    At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkesof Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing membersand Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for theconsumers for the year from July 1.
