Canada will propose at the new round ofinternational trade talks that most trade-distorting farmsubsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade MinisterPat Carney said.    "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created avicious circle which continues to cause problems ofoverproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the Houseof Commons.    Carney was outlining the government's new position on thefarm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in themultilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade).    While few details were released, Carney said the governmentwould also be pressing for an improvement in market access andnew measures to ensure countries do not erect artificialbarriers.    "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have toensure that domestic policies and programs to address thespecific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," agovernment background paper said.    "Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,credit could be given to countries which effectively controlthe output of farm products," the papers said. Reuter&#3;
