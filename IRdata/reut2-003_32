Uganda, Africa's second largest coffeeproducer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffeetalks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee MarketingBoard, CMB, said.    "This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in asituation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne ofrobusta coffee," J. Makumbi said when he returned from London onFriday.    Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formulato share the world's coffee production during InternationalCoffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.    Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which weresuspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that itsquota be increased dramatically.    Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually fromcoffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings --had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.    The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to overthree mln bags.    For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICOexport quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.    The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties forabout 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employsover half of salaried manpower.    In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and LivestockDevelopment Minister Paul Bomani said today Third Worldcountries would suffer from the failure of the London coffeetalks.    "It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.    Bomani called on the ICO to convene another meeting withintwo months, saying, "Once tempers have cooled and delegationshave had time to report back to their headquarters, commonsense will prevail."
