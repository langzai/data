The European Community launched aninvestigation into allegations of dumping by Japanesesemiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could markan intensification of world trade strains.    Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washingtonfor the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips itimports into the U.S.    The EC Executive Commission said today the EuropeanElectrical Component Manufacturers Association complained thatJapanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasableprogrammable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.    Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROMmarket, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had beenforced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct inorder to compete with the Japanese.    The Commission said it believed the Association had givensufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant aninvestigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it foundthe complaints were justified.    The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privilegedaccess to the Japanese market. REUTER&#3;
