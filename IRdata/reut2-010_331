A scheme to distribute surplus foodfree to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was dueto expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for afurther month, an EC Commission spokesman said.    He added the executive Commission has not yet decidedwhether the scheme should become a permanent feature of theEC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farmproduce.    Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter andother food have been authorised for distribution under anoperation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 inwhich charities act as executive Commission agents.    The original idea was to help the needy survive this year'sunusually cold European winter.    The spokesman said the Commission was extending the schemefully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonalsnowstorms, for the month of April.    Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks offood for which they have already applied under the scheme up toApril 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution offlour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high ratenext month.    He said the Commission, which has powers to continue mostaspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.    Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln Europeancurrency units, would be a major consideration.    End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter,520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals. REUTER&#3;
