U.S. Secretary of State George Shultzforecast a golden future for the Philippines after talks on itsstruggle for economic recovery and its fight against communistinsurgents.    Speaking at a luncheon after an hour-long meeting withPresident Corazon Aquino, Shultz delivered a powerful anduncompromising endorsement of the Manila government.    "There is a golden future out there for the Filipino peopleto gain," he said. But he tempered his praise with a veiled hintWashington's attitude might change if what it called thecurrent realism was seen to be diluted.    "The political dreams of only 18 months ago are becoming thedemocratic institutions of today," Shultz said. "Your economy isdeveloping an impressive head of steam, the insurgents arelearning that threats and intimidation will not stop theFilipino people from voting for democracry."    He said he had been struck by the widespread awareness ofthe problems facing the Philippines.    "No one I have met under-estimates the tasks which lie aheador the need to act upon them. That Filipino realism is anessential element of American confidence in the Philippines," hesaid.    Shultz said the revolution which brought Aquino to power 18months ago was still under way.    He praised the efforts made by the armed forces incombatting the communist insurgency, now in its 18th year,adding that Aquino was also addressing the social and economicproblems fuelling the rebellion.    Defence Minister Rafael Ileto, briefing reporters after aseparate meeting with Shultz, said the U.S. Was just asconfident as he was that the communists would be beaten.    U.S. Officials made it clear before the start of today'stalks that they expected no dramatic developments. REUTER&#3;
