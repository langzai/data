The Governor of the Central Bank ofWest African CFA franc zone countries (UMOA) today urged thatthe bank should be involved in all negotiations with theInternational Monetary Fund but said the zone's seven membercountries were not thinking of ditching the fund.    Abdoulaye Fadiga told reporters after a regular one-daymeeting of UMOA finance ministers here that the bank'sparticipation in future credit talks with the IMF would promotea greater coherence in Fund aid granted to the region.    But he stresed that UMOA, which last month called for a newrelationship with the IMF, was not contemplating a break withthe fund.    "Member states (of UMOA) never envisaged breaking with theFund," he said.    He said an extraordinary UMOA meeting held in Ivory Coast'sinland capital, Yamoussoukro, last month, stresssed the needfor growth-oriented IMF adjustment policies.    "Borrowing to pay off debts cannot be a solution," Fadigaadded.    UMOA members are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali,Niger, Senegal and Togo. The zone's common-curreny, the CFAfranc, is pegged to the French franc at the rate of 50 CFAfrancs to one French franc.    Fadiga said many of the region's problems stem from lowcommodity prices and a weak dollar.    He applauded last week's agreement between producers andconsumers on the functioning of a new international cocoa pact,saying negotiation of other commodity accords would benefitUMOA countries.
