South Africa's new foreign debtagreement sparked a rally in local financial markets, butbankers and economists said the pact removes only one source ofanxiety from a still depressed economy.    "We have not gone from 'no confidence' to 'full confidence'yet," commented one banker, who saw the agreement as havingmarginal influence on fundamental economic problems.    Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as themain impetus behind increases today in both the commercial andfinancial rand.    The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumpednearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts.    All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners takeplace through the financial rand, which is considered the mainbarometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseasinvestors.    Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gainsin the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.    They said the financial rand in particular was being drivenby a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that couldfavorably affect the currency.    Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loanbalances and short-term claims into equity investments in SouthAfrica.    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bankwas "investigating the implications of such conversions in lightof terms and restrictions of the financial rand system."    Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night saidthe recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that"some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic viewof South Africa."    Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over thenext three years. The agreement extends a standstillarrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place sinceAugust, 1985.    Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmedtheir private estimates and could be comfortably met by themonetary authorities.    "They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and weoffered the minimum," said one banking source, reacting toreports from London that creditors were hoping for largerrepayments.    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africashould have "no difficulty whatsoever" with the terms.    Economists said the debt agreement would have nosignificant impact on economic problems continuing to faceSouth Africa including high rates of inflation andunemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.    Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speakingyesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was "inbad shape" and there was "an awful lot of talk but little action"to cure serious problems.
