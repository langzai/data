General Motors Corp believes it mustbecome competitive with other with auto manufacturers in thenext five years or cease building its cars in the U.S., apublished report said.    The Detroit Free Press quoted GM industrial relationsvice-president Alfred Warren as saying "we've got about threeto five years to either get our act together or get out of thebusiness."    "People cannot believe we could stop building automobilesin the United States," he said, adding "I'm sure theelectronics people felt the same way."    Warren, who will be GM's chief negotiator this summer inlabor bargaining on a new contract covering 380,000 U.S. hourlyworkers, said there will be a greater loss of jobs if GM'sshare of the U.S. car market continues to decline.    And he added the United Automobile Workers union mustresolve its concerns over job security with GM because its"jobs are at General Motors...not somewhere else."    Warren said GM may have been "foolish" in the lastrecession to agree to bring back laid-off UAW members to itsparts-making operations because "today we would be better offhad we not brought workers back."
