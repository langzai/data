The relatively high level of real U.S.interest rates suggests that there is scope for furtherdeclines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve isunlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remainsvolatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.    He said in response to a reporter's question after thebank's annual meeting that money market rates could declinefurther but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage thatas long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of thedollar, he did not see rates going much higher.    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending ratewas "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum ofrates."    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth thisyear.    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's declineand oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5to four pct rate in 1987. Reuter&#3;
