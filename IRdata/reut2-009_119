A strong performance by its retailbusinesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson HoldingsLtd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in1986, stock analysts said.    They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings ofbetween 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mlnin 1985.    The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to paya total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents ashare in 1985.    James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the incometo retail sales.    Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and itsfranchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxurygoods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.    Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put JardineMatheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said heestimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.    But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall toabout 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.    The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from HongKong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.    Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm asa result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will bookrevenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of theyear as part of its retail business, which will increase itsoverall retail income figures.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharplyincreased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pctshare of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.    Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest paymentsof about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mlndlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at aboutthe 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.    But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mlndlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.    Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisationsthat will in effect turn it into a holding company for itsdiverse interests.    It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in bothHong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;JardineStrategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.    A company statement issued last month said the firm willuse the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with anadditional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.    Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stakein the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it islikely to develop its own business, analysts said.    "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's abilityto creatively structure some new acquisitions," said Hargreavesof Hoare Govett.    He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a keysector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to itsexisting business. REUTER&#3;
