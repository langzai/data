Tribune Co said a pre-tax charge of 16.7mln dlrs or 11 cts a share in employee severance costs at theNew York Daily News led to a 73 pct decline in the company's1987 third-quarter earnings.    Tribune reported net income of 33,085,000 dlrs or 42 cts ashare, down from 123,450,000 dlrs or 1.53 dlrs in the 1986third quarter.    The company also said its 1986 third-quarter results wereboosted by a one-time pre-tax gain of 145 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrsa share from sale of its cable television systems.    After adjusting for these extraordinary items, TribunePresident Stanton Cook said 1987 year-end should be strong.    "Overall, we expect Tribune company's earnings beforenon-recurring factors to show solid improvement for 1987," Cooksaid.    A 14 pct increase in newsprint prices since the 1986 thirdquarter depressed newspaper publishing operating profits, thecompany said. They were up only slightly at 46.1 mln dlrs afteradjusting for Daily News severance costs, from 45 mln dlrs inthe 1986 quarter, it said.    Increased efficiency at the Tribune's two paper mills,however, contributed to a 56 pct gain in newsprint operatingprofits to 21.8 mln dlrs from 14 mln dlrs, it said.    Reuter&#3;
