The King could ask Martens or another political leader toput together a new government or to form a caretakeradministration with elections at the end of November or inearly December.    The King has so far withheld a decision on whether toaccept the resignation last Thursday of Martens's coalition ofDutch and French speaking parties over the linguistic conflict.    Martens has used the breathing space to try to put togethera compromise solution but RTBF and the Belgian news agencyBelga said leading ministers ended their talks early on Mondaymorning without agreement.
