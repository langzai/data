A top United Arab Emirates (UAE)banker said a new law would be introduced soon obliging courtsto recognise interest rates contracted between bank andborrower.    Sheikh Suroor bin Sultan al-Dhahiri, Chairman of Abu DhabiCommercial Bank, told reporters after the shareholders' meetinglast night the decree would make interest in debt cases payableat the contracted rate up to the day a case is filed in court.    Subsequently, interest would be charged at a maximum ninepct for personal and 12 pct for corporate loans, he said.    The law, if passed, would mark a breakthrough in solvingwhat UAE bankers say is one of their biggest problems,collecting bad debts in court.    Under current UAE law in all emirates, except Dubai, courtsrecognise only simple interest at a maximum nine and 12 pcteven if a loan was contracted at higher compounded rates.    The Central Bank said last year that roughly a quarter oftotal loans in the UAE banking system were non-performing.Sheikh Suroor also said a judicial committee set up to considerdebt cases would begin functioning within a month.
