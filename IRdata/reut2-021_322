Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 majoragricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong,has emerged as an important third force in any multilateraltrade talks. "There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is beingseen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in otherinternational trade negotiations," he said.    Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the UnitedStates, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, saidconsiderable progress has been made by the group towardsfighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developedcountries.
