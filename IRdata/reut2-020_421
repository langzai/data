Ford Motor Co Chairman Donald Petersenstill expects slightly more than 15 mln U.S.-made cars andtrucks will be sold domestically in 1987, he told reporters.    This is down from the 16.1 mln U.S. built vehicles solddomestically last year, he added.    Despite the sell-off in world stock markets, Petersen said,the underlying fundamentals in the private sector of the U.S.economy remain strong so calendar 1988 vehicle sales shouldequal the 1987 total.       Petersen said he could not explain nor predict stock marketactivity.    But he called for government officials to seriously addresslong-term problems such as the trade and budget deficits,stating the dollar is still too strong relative to other majorcurrencies.    For example, he said, the dollar should be about 120 yencurrently instead of its present level just below 144 yen.       Petersen said Ford plans to spend substantially more in thenext five years than the 15.9 billion dlrs spent in the lastfive on new products and upgrading of its manufacturingoperations.    In 1986, Ford spent 3.4 billion dlrs to upgrade vehiclemanufacturing plants, he noted.    He also said growth in free world car and truck sales willbe 1.8 pct per year over the next 10 years.    Worldwide over-capacity, which was about 2.7 mln units in1985, could expand to nine mln units by 1990, with more thanfive mln of those units in North America, Petersen said.        Reuter&#3;
