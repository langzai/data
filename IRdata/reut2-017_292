The Reagan Administration isconsidering tax incentives to boost oil output and restore100,000 jobs, U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said.    A tax credit for new exploration would be part of a packageto bring 1,000 idle drilling rigs back into operation and raisedomestic production by one mln barrels a day, he said.    The tax status of exploration might also be changed,Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress.    He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult timesinternationally and had been devastated in the United States.    Consumer demand and a significant decline in domesticproduction has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mlnbarrels a day in over the last 16 months, Herrington said.    "Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in ourdomestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase ourenergy security," he said.    The administration is committed to improving marketplaceconditions and incentives to spur exploration and development.    "This commitment includes rejecting quick fix solutions,like an oil import fee, which are bad for the United States andbad for the world," he added. REUTER&#3;
