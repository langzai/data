The director of the Office ofManagement and Budget James Miller warned that a tax increasewould jeapordise real U.S. economic growth.    "It's a bad idea. We don't need more money to balance thebudget. We need to reduce spending and avoid things that wouldhalt economic expansion," Miller told students at theUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.    "I think economic growth could be threatened mightily if wehave a tax increase or by the perception that we're giving upon deficit reduction," he said.    Miller criticised a proposal by House speaker Jim Wright toput a one pct tax on securities transactions.    He said the tax would probably be ineffective becausepeople would avoid by holding their portfolios in otherinstruments, like real estate, or simply by not trading asoften.    Miller said he doubted this proposal would pass.    "I think it is frankly all but political suicide toadvocate a tax increase unless the president championed it aswell," he said. "And he's not going to do it, in fact he wouldveto a tax increase," Miller added. Reuter&#3;
