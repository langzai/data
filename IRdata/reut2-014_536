Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegiansubsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss ofjust over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankerssaid they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.    Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad toldReuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiariesoperating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring forinvestment banking away from commercial banking and an economicslump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.    Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries inNorway since 1985.    Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway'ssecond-hand securities and equities markets, to be approvedlater this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements wouldmake profit this year.    Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, butSejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of plannedliberalisation and better economic performance, helped by asteadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.    Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N>subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavylosses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking. REUTER&#3;
