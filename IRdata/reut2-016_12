The Chicago Board Options Exchange,CBOE, said it will list new Standard and Poor 500 stock indexoptions beginning April 20 that will trade side-by-side withthe existing S and P 500 options &lt;SPX>.    The new S and P 500 option contract differs from theexisting contract in that settlement of the new contract willbe based on the opening value of the index on expirationFriday.

The new opening settlement S and P 500 options will beoffered only in months in which there are S and P 500 futures.    Initial months to be listed in the new options will beJune, September and December, the CBOE said.    Dissemination of the settlement of price of the new optionswill be made through a special ticker symbol -- &lt;SET>, theexchange said.    There will initially be seven series of strike prices foreach contract month of the new options -- one strike price "atthe money," or near to the actual spot index value, and threeabove and three below the spot index.    Position limits in any combination of both the new andexisting S and P 500 options will be 15,000 contracts.    The exchange said in the rare event that a stock does notopen on expiration Friday, the previous day's closing price ofthat stock will be used to calculate the settlement value ofthe index. Reuter&#3;
