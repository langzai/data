New Zealand ports reopened at 0730hrs local time (1930 GMT March 22) after being closed sinceMarch 19 because of a strike over pay claims by watersiders, aWaterside Federation spokesman said.    But industrial action by other port workers is likely tocause further disruption, Harbour Workers union secretary RossWilson told Reuters.    Wilson said his members are holding stopwork meetings thismorning to consider further stoppages over their pay claim.    The two disputes are not related.    Harbour Workers around the country went on strike for 24hours on March 16, but Wilson said any further action willoccur on a port-by-port basis. Reuter&#3;
