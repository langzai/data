The European Community Commission hasdecided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonneimposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.    They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC andnon-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exportsfrom Spanish ports south of Valencia.    The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority'scereals management committee today.    The tax had been introduced last September at the same timeas a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exportsof maize to Spain from other EC member countries.    The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported intoSpain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies frombeing reexported back to them.    The sources added that Spain had received no answer fromthe committee to its request that tenders be opened for thesale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.    The request will be considered at the committee's nextmeeting, the commission sources said.    Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes ofmaize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-ECproducer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.
