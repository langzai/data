Indonesia has imported palm oil thisyear and is likely to take more, trade sources said.    They were commenting on a weekend Jakarta report quoting aMinistry of Trade spokesman as saying Indonesia had not issuedlicences to import the commodity. He also said there was nosign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia.    A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oilto Indonesia in February, additional vessels were loading thismonth and other vessels had been earmarked for April.    Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked forIndonesia but would not disclose tonnages.    Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year hadbeen below expectations and current stocks were low. They saidlicences were issued at the start of the year to import crudepalm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein andRBD oil.    Last week there were rumours in European markets thatIndonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnesof palm oil for deliveries commencing April. An IndonesianMinistry of Trade official said this was incorrect.    Some traders here said the total could be more. Others saidthey could include those issued earlier this year andapplications not yet granted. Reuter&#3;
