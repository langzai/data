The European Commission has not taken adecision on applications from the British government for therelease of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto theBritish market in May and June, Commission sources said.    They said last week's cereals management committee agreedto release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tendersbetween April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned toallow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.    However, it decided to leave consideration of the releaseof further wheat until later.    The British government had applied for the release of afurther 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from Britishintervention stores to prevent market prices rising.    However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to reviewthe market situation nearer the time before giving itsapproval.    The Commission was given new powers last year to controlthe release of intervention cereals onto the market, thesources noted.    Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministryof Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance thatadditional quantities of intervention wheat would be madeavailable in May and June. It also said that it was envisagedthat monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,depending on the state of the market.    This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commissionhad actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during thethree months of April, May and June at last week's meeting. Reuter&#3;
