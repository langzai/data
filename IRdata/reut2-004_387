The new British one ounce gold coin, the"Britannia," will be priced on the basis of the gold price on theday of purchase plus a "competitive premium," Treasury officialssaid.    Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by membersof the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreigncoins, although transactions between members of the London GoldMarket and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. Nodecision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.    Although a number of gold coins, especially the CanadianMaple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take theplace of the South African krugerrand, the British governmentstill feels that there is a gap in the market for a British oneounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available atpresent is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.    Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be usedin the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would bebought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would bedifficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.    No details are yet available on how many coins will beissued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said thatthe amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.    There were some enquiries on the "Britannia" from coindealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factorin the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to putoff many investors, traders said.    Some said that the "Britannia" had come too late, with theCanadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coinsalready well established. Reuter&#3;
