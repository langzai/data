Consumers Power Co said it willpay Union Carbide Corp 39.2 mln dlrs in settlement of a suitthat began in July 1982.    Consumers Power said the settlement will cause it to take aone-time loss of six mln dlrs, or seven cts a share, in itsfirst quarter.    The impact will be less than the payment to Union Carbidebecause Consumers Power set up a reserve to account for thesettlement, the tax effect of the settlement, and "somebook-keeping," a spokesman said.    Union Carbide had sought 162.5 mln dlrs in damages fromConsumers Power.    Half of the settlement will be paid immediately in cash.The remainder will be paid in real estate.    The dispute involved a long-term contract which ConsumersPower entered into in 1980 to buy residual fuel from UnionCarbide. In 1982 Consumers Power stopped taking oil under thecontract, claiming it was excused from buying more oil undercertain provisions of the accord.    Union Carbide said it plans to resell the real estate,located in northern Michigan, according to Consumers Power. Reuter&#3;
