Proven oil and gas deposits in SaudiArabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, accordingto the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.    Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ftfrom 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.    Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between SaudiArabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels perday in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.    Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, asOPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapturetheir share of the market. In the process, prices collapsedfrom about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until theorganisation decided to cut production again from lastSeptember onwards.    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightlyto 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on theofficial Saudi Press Agency.    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in thenumber of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant wasupgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enablingit to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, thereport said.    The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned byanother state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- producedaround 750,000 bpd last year.    Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company beganoperating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnesper day, the report said.    Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs. REUTER&#3;
