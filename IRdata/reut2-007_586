Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat over the long-term the tax reform bill and lower marginaltax rates should increase compliance with the tax law and bringin additional revenue.    In testimony before a senate appropriations subcommitteeBaker said no savings in the Treasury's budgetary requirementswil be achieved in the short-run by the new tax law.    "The tax changes occurring in 1987 and 1988 under tax reformwill not directly effect IRS enforcement activities untilfinancial year 1989 and 1990."    He told the subcommittee that the Treasury's objective wasto strengthen the capability of the Internal Revenue Service topromote tax compliance and generate revenue.    He said they were seeking funds to increase staffing toreduce the backlog of delinquent tax accounts, reducing pendingtax litigation cases under appeal, and resolving unreportedincome cases disclosed through a program that matches thirdparty documents to returns.    "This request will continue our effort to build a strongerand more credible deterrent against non-compliance with taxlaws," he said.    Baker also told the subcommittee that the administrationwould continue the efforts to improve the management of thegovernment's cash and credit, and its financial information.     In addition a policy of full reimbursement to FederalReserve Banks for the fiscal agent services they provide inmarketing and maintaining Treasury securities will becontinued. Reuter&#3;
