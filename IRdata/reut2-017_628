Federal law enforcement authoritiessaid they began a criminal investigation of R.J. ReynoldsTobacco Co after the company imported herbicide-tainted tobaccoand then exported tainted cigarettes to Japan.    "We can confirm that the U.S. Customs Service has launched acriminal investigation of Reynolds," a Customs spokesman toldReuters.    "There is an investigation under way," said Bob Edmunds, theU.S. attorney in Greensboro, N.C.    Reynolds is a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc. ofWinston-Salem, N.C.    The investigation is particularly embarrassing--for Tokyoand Washington, as well as the company--because the Japanesegovernment, under pressure from the United States, agreed onlylast year to open its markets to U.S.-made tobacco products.    R.J. Reynolds spokesman David Fishel said in a telephoneinterview that his company acknowledged importing into theUnited States large amounts of tobacco treated with aweedkiller called Dicamba, and then exporting cigarettes madewith the tobacco to Japan. He acknowledged the weed killer waspresent in the tobacco at levels exceeding U.S. standards butsaid use of the tobacco did not pose a threat to human health.    "Dicamba is approved by the government for use on a varietyof crops including food crops, and is widely used as a ripeningagent on tobacco," Fishel said.    Earlier today, Japanese Finance Ministry official EtsuzoKawade said in Tokyo that government authorities were holding alarge shipment of Winston Lights manufactured by R.J. Reynoldsafter tests showed some of them contained unacceptable amountsof the weedkiller.    "We do not believe the herbicide posed a serious threat topeople's health but the levels were unacceptable by law," Kawadesaid. Reuter&#3;
