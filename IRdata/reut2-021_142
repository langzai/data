The Supreme Court let stand a rulingthat Northrop Corp &lt;NOC> must pay 31 mln dlrs to a companycontrolled by Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi.    The court denied a Northrop appeal challenging a U.S.arbitration tribunal's ruling that it pay 31 mln dlrs incommissions and interest stemming from arms contracts it wonfrom Saudi Arabia in the early 1970s.    Northrop, seeking to sell F-5 fighter aircraft andsupporting services to Saudi Arabia, hired Khashoggi's firm in1970 as its marketing representative.    Northrop paid more than 17 mln dlrs in commissions toKhashoggi's firm, Triad International Marketing, from 1971 to1975. U.S. Defense Department records showed that Northrops'sales to Saudi Arabia during this period totaled 4.2 billiondlrs.    The legal battle dates back to 1979, when Khashoggi beganarbitration proceedings seeking payment of more than 150 mlndlrs in commissions due under his agreement with Northrop.    A federal judge in 1984 threw out the arbitration panel'saward of 31 mln dlrs to Khashoggi's firm, but a U.S. Court ofAppeals reinstated it last March. Reuter&#3;
