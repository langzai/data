A five billion dlr credit facility beingarranged for two units of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>attracted over 15 billion dlrs in syndication but will not beincreased, Morgan Guaranty Ltd said on behalf of MorganGuaranty Trust Co of New York, the arranger.    It said that 64 of BP's relationship banks will be joiningthe facility, although their participations will be cut backdramatically. Banks had been invited as lead managers at 200mln dlrs, managers at 125 mln and co-managers at 75 mln.    BP will make the final decision on the allotments broadlybased on relationships rather than on the amounts offered.    The facility is being arranged for BP International and BPNorth America in conjunction with the company's planned tenderoffer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not alreadyown.    Because of the purpose of the facility, Morgan only hadfive business days to arrange the facility. As a result, itcarried terms that bankers considered relatively favourablewhen compared with those on most other recent credits. Thefacility fee, for example, was 1/8 pct compared with the 1/16pct BP paid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing. REUTER&#3;
