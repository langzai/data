Brazil has set up a special debtcommission, headed by Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, to beresponsible for renegotiating Brazil's 109 billion dollarforeign debt, officials said.    The principal negotiator on the commission, created byPresident Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister RamiroSaraiva Guerreiro.    Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commissionby eight senior officials, including a representative of theNational Security Council.    The creation of the commission is intended to underscorethe Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue isessentially political and that a political solution must befound to the problem.    On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlr foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.    Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they areequally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief.    Yesterday Funaro travelled to the U.S. for fresh debtnegotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasilia'ssuspension of interest payments. Reuter&#3;
