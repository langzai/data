Atcor Inc said a Federal Court hasreinstated a 1986 jury verdict against it and in favor ofIndian Head Inc for antitrust damages of 3.8 mln dlrs beforetrebling and attorneys' fees.    The company said it will challenge the ruling by the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which reversed adecision of the District Court in its favor.    The case involved charges that Atcor acted improperly inopposing Indian Head's attempt to have its plastic electricalconduit sanctioned by the National Fire Protection Associationunder the 1981 National Electrical Code, it said.    Atcor said the ruling by the three-judge panel of the Courtof Appeal was incorrect and "seriously questionable in light ofestablished Supreme Court doctrine".    The legal avenues to be examined in an attempt to have theruling reversed could include filing a petition for SupremeCourt review, the company added. Reuter&#3;
