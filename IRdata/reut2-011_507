Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigesaid the United States would go ahead with planned 300 mln dlrsanctions against Japanese semiconductor exports, despite anyU.S. Japanese talks to avert the trade curbs.    He said in a speech to an export-import group that he wassure the United States and Japan could work out their disputeover unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,but "I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."    Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.    He also said he did not think there would be a trade warwith Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to theUnited States to risk such a war.    "Those fears are unfounded," he said.    He told reporters later that the sharp drop in thesecurities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fearof inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.    Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in thevalue of the dollar, although trade issues did have someeffect.    Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the dropin the market to trade sanctions were "barking up the wrongtree."    He said the market observers will realize this shortly.    Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anythingabout the market or the exchange rate of the dollar. Reuter&#3;
