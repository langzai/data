Northair Mines Ltdsaid it would oppose Nor-Quest Resources Inc's earlier reportedproposed takeover bid "with every means at its disposal,"saying "this attempt at a property grab is an insult to theintelligence of our shareholders."    It said Nor-Quest's offer to swap one Nor-Quest share plusone dlr for two Northair shares would seriously diluteNorthair's equity in its Willa mine in British Columbia.    "Our company is in sound financial position and productionfinancing can be readily arranged when required. We're notlooking for a partner and if we were, it certainly wouldn't bethese guys," Northair said. Reuter&#3;
