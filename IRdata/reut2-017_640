A trade bill before the United StatesHouse of Representatives "is a very dangerous bill for Canadianindustry," Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman AdamZimmerman told reporters.    By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3removes protection for companies that take advantage of widelyused government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.    "Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grantrights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could bevulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language," hesaid.    The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the Houseof Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuringsubsidies that would greatly increase the size of anycountervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadianresource exports to the U.S.    Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices andU.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, hesaid. Such a method would make Canadian resource industriesvulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export taximposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumberto the U.S., Zimmerman added.    Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervailduty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.    "We represent the first victim of the move to price othercountries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,"Zimmerman said.    "If we're an example, than other resource industries hadbetter watch out," he added.    Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plansto discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groupsfrom other Canadian resource industries. Reuter&#3;
