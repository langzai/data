Canada will increase corporate taxrevenues by about five billion dlrs over the next five years bybroadening the tax base and allowing fewer exemptions, financeminister Michael Wilson said.     As Wilson previously promised, he said corporations willbear an increased tax burden, despite new measures to loweroverall tax rates.     Increased corporate revenues will result from broadeningthe tax base and eliminating special tax exemptions.     "The jobs of many Canadians depend on a corporate incometax system that is competitive with other countries,particularly the United States," Wilson said in a preparedspeech to the House of Commons.     "And it (tax reform) will ensure that profitablecorporations carry a bigger share of the total tax burden," headded.     Federal tax revenue from corporations will increase by 470mln dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1988, 410 mln dlrsin fiscal 1989 and 1.19 billion dlrs in fiscal 1990, accordingto documents tabled with Wilson's speech.
