Peruvian President Alan Garcia saidhis government was not trying to convince other nations tofollow its decision to limit foreign debt repayments.    "We do not want to export a model," Garcia told a pressconference at the end of an official two-day visit to Mexicoyesterday. He was referring to Peru's policy of limitingpayments on its 14 billion dlr debt to 10 pct of its exportearnings.    Peru's attitude contrasts with that of Mexico, whichfollowed a more conciliatory route and last week signed a 7.7billion dlr loan package with its creditor banks.    Since it decided to put a ceiling on debt payments, Peruhas been barred from International Monetary Fund lending.    Despite their different approaches to debt, Garcia andMexican President Miguel de la Madrid issued a jointdeclaration yesterday calling the foreign debt problem an"expression of the present unjust international economic order."But the declaration said that no Latin American debtors' clubwas about to appear.    "We affirm the sovereignty of our economic decisions and thecapacity for mobilising our own resources," it said.    The two presidents also signed a variety of agreementsaimed at boosting trade and tourism between their countries aswell a number of technical cooperation pacts.    Garcia was scheduled to return to Lima tomorrow. REUTER&#3;
