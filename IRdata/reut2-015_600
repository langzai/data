Brazilian cocoa exporters are notlikely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort toboost world prices, trade sources said.    They said a similar procedure was taken in the past inBrazil and that it did not work out according to plans.    "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, whichis controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters inBrazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.    The traders were responding to questions whether they wouldfollow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.    The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign TradeDepartment, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market byrejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipmentcriteria.    "The position of local producers is always to negotiate asthey please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and thinkit's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added. Reuter&#3;
