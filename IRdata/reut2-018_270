After a highly favorable reception ofa trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flourlast February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery ofa first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, thedepartment noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheatunder the Export Enhancement Program last November, but localopposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has beendelaying deliveries.    As a result there were a series of baking seminars as wellas the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millersand convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegalremain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market thathad been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly Frenchwheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.
