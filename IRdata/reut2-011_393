Shifts from mild to very coldweather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sownwinter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, theU.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.    In a field report, the officer said indications were thatwinter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares comparedwith 38,000 last year.    He said the damage was probably more limited in southernand central regions and most widespread in the north.    Damage was most severe on plants above the ground wherelittle or no snow cover was present, he added.    The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshineduring the day led to some heaving, particularly for welldeveloped plants and for winter barley.    Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standingwater occurred in the fields.    The officer said repairing damage will probably call forspecial measures this spring in fields with damaged plants andwhere stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timedapplications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added. Reuter&#3;
