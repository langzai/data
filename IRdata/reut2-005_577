The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, CBOE, announced todaythat they will trade futures and options, respectively, on anindex of international securities compiled by Morgan StanleyGroup Inc.    Morgan Stanley said it has agreed to license the exchangesto use the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe,Australia and Far East, or EAFE, stock index as the tradingbasis.    The EAFE index is comprised of 900 international stocksfrom 16 nations in Europe, the Far East, and Australia.    "The EAFE is the only instrument by which world markets aremeasured," CME special counsel Leo Melamed said at a newsconference announcing the agreement.    CME Chairman Jack Sandner noted that one-third of theexchange's daily trading volume now derives from overseas.    "The success of our index markets, particularly the S and Pindex, is ample precedent to forging ahead" in internationalmarkets, he said.    Mark Sladkus, publisher of Morgan Stanley CapitalInternational Perspective, said Japanese bank stocks representthe largest portion of the index.    The officials said the exchanges have not yet submitted theEAFE index to the Securities and Exchange Commission and theCommodities Futures Trading Commission for approval.    However, Melamed said approval is not expected to begranted quickly, and the exchanges did not set a starting datefor the new contracts.    The EAFE index is tabulated daily, but Sladkus saidreal-time calculation will be introduced when trading begins.    The conflicting opening and closing of internationalsecurities markets will have to be accommodated in thecalculations, he noted.    Morgan Stanley has been calculating the EAFE index weeklysince 1970 and daily since 1972.    The CME and CBOE will negotiate with a third party to be"an independent monitor ... the guardian" of the index, Melamedsaid. "Morgan will remove itself from deciding which stocksmove in and out of the index." Reuter&#3;
