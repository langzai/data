Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said that Brazil will need more external financing towork its way out of its current debt crisis than earlieranticipated.    "External financing will have to be found in larger amountsthan anticipated a few months ago," he said in remarks preparedfor a business leader luncheon.    Volcker said that financing, however, must take place alongwith policies that come to grips with Brazil's internaldifficulties.    Volcker said Brazil has a lot more negotiating to do withinternational institutions and its bank creditors but addedthat a solution to its financial problems can be found.    "The predicate for these negotiations has to be effectivepolicy at home (in Brazil)," Volcker told reporters.    "Brazil, it seems to me, has a strong self interest inrestoring a more normal situation (on interest payments) sothat it can continue to participate freely in trade with therest of the world - and it has so indicated," Volcker said inhis prepared remarks.    Brazil suspended interest payments on its debt last month. Reuter&#3;
