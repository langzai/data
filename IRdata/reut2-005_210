The Bank of England said it invited anearly round of bill offers from discount houses afterforecasting a shortage in the system of some 1.05 billion stg.    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturingin official hands and treasury bill take-up will drain some1.07 billion stg while exchequer transactions will take outaround 335 mln stg and bankers' balances below target five mlnstg.    Partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulationwill add some 355 mln stg to the system today. REUTER&#3;
