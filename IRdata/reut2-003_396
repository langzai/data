The leaf disease corenes pora,which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka andIndonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push updepressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said.    Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be savedand must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protectionand Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute ofMalaysia (RRIM), told Reuters.    He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenespora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may causeoutput to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.    The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institutemay ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by thedisease and added that most estates affected belong to theState Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.    Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affectscertain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and thatfurther use of such clones must be discontinued.    Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber ResearchInstitute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444,2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said.    Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbedafter use of such clones were discontinued.    Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which alsoaffects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experiencehas proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added.    "The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is notcurbed in the two affected countries their rubber output maydrop and prices can rise," he said.    He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak inSri Lanka and was monitoring the situation. REUTER&#3;
