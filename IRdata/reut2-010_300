The South African government'smaize production estimate of 7.8 mln tonnes for the currentyear is "rather too conservative," leading grain and producemerchants Kahn and Kahn Pty Ltd said.    The company, in a detailed report, estimated the harvest ashigh as 8.3 mln tonnes and said if this forecast is met theostensible surplus for export will be approximately 2.25 mlntonnes.    "This paradoxically is creating a problem for the MaizeBoard," Kahn and Kahn said.    It said the maize export price currently is depressed andthe board is "probably confronted with the necessity to maintainor slightly increase the internal price of maize again...Tooffset the ostensible loss which must be faced" on exportingsurplus amounts.
