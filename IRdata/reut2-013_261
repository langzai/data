&lt;Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly ownedsubsidiary of &lt;Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed aproduction sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil companyPertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra.    It was the second production sharing contract signed byPertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986.    The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presenceof Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oilproduction split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour.    Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mlndlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first twoyears.    The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oilproducing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials saidthere is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.    A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilledbefore, was neglected because it is deeper than surroundingblocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have nowmade seismic survey possible.    The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contractPertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.    Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina'sfavour with operational costs deducted.    Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil'sproduction share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interestin the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it findsoil.    Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude forrefining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels aday. REUTER&#3;
