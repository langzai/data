Mauritian Finance Minister SeetanahLutchmeenmaraidoo said the island's first offshore bank couldopen in January 1988.    The minister was announcing the creation of a committee ofeight economists to look at ways of encouraging foreigninvestment, especially offshore banking.    The committee, part of the government's plans to makeMauritius an international financial centre, is expected tosubmit its recommendations within three months.    Lutchmeenmaraidoo also circulated a white paper onlegislation to set up a stock exchange on the island.    He said the exchange would be a powerful instrument ofeconomic democratisation and the legislation would includeincentives to encourage shareholding by a wide public.    The government would also introduce a bill to protectinvestors and set up a vigilance committee with powers tosuspend any company from the stock exchange, halt trading inits shares and take punitive measures for illegal practices.    The stock exchange would probably become fully operationalin the next five to 10 years, he added. REUTER&#3;
