Pyongyang and a group of Tokyo-basedNorth Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Koreangoldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within twoyears from 600 pounds at present, said Li Sangsu, a spokesmanfor &lt;Unzan Mine Development Co>, the venture partner.    Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increaseoutput to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.    "We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen ingold deposits," he said.    The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of sixor seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 milesnorth of Pyongyang, Li said.    Li said modern equipment and advanced technology wouldincrease yields. "Up to now, the mining was done with antiquatedmethods and basic equipment."    The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves byNorth Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors.    Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay offpart of its debt with several tonnes of fish. REUTER&#3;
