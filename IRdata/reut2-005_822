Production of fish meal by the threeSouth American producers -- Chile, Peru and Equador -- lastyear reached 2.5 mln tonnes, equalling the record output of1970, the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers(IAFMM) said.    However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chileanand Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the lastquarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile forthe month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peruin the same month.    The statement added that, due to technical market promotionand energetic sales by Chile and Peru, the stock position atthe end of the year remained reasonable.    Fish meal production outside South America decreasedslightly, falling from 114,400 to 111,100 tonnes.    The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in WestGermany, Scandinavian countries, Eastern Europe and the FarEast, but fell in the U.S. And remained static in the U.K.    It added that fish meal consumption had suffered fromcompetition with feed grade tallow in the U.S. And with skimmedmilk powder in the U.K.    IAFMM figures for fish oil production in the main producingnations, in thousands of tonnes, were -                    Oct/Dec            Jan/Dec                 1986    1985       1986     1985 CHILE             22       8        109       76 PERU              56      28        238      104 NORWAY            14      14         97      130 ICELAND           44      52        102      118 DENMARK           20      18         88       77 U.S.              10       8        152      129 JAPAN             67      91        213      249 REUTER&#3;
