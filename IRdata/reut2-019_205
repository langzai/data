The U.S. Court of Appeals for theSecond Circuit upheld a lower court decision dismissing a suitby Apex Oil Co against the New York Mercantile Exchange andseveral oil companies.    The Court, however, ruled that Apex Oil could pursueanititrust and commodities market manipulation allegationsagainst Belcher Oil Co, a unit of Coastal Corp &lt;CGP>.    Apex Oil, primarily a trading company, charged that severalcompanies, including Belcher, and NYMEX conspired to force itto deliver heating oil it had sold on the mercantile exchange,knowing Apex could not make full delivery.       The NYMEX ordered Apex to deliver four mln barrels ofheating oil sold via a February 1982 heating oil contract. Apexeventually fulfilled this obligation but claimed damages.    Richard Wiener, attorney for Apex at Cadwalader Wickershamand Taft, said the company has not yet decided whether topursue its case against Belcher Oil.    The NYMEX, meanwhile, has a counterclaim pending againstApex Oil, seeking an unspecified amount of attorney's fees and15 mln dlrs in punitive damages, according to a NYMEXspokeswoman. Reuter&#3;
