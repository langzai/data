The cantonal government of Zurich wants aproposed federal law making "money laundering" an offence topunish negligence and not just gross negligence, the cantonalinformation service said.    The Zurich authorities said they supported proposalsunveiled by the federal government in February to make it acrime for anyone to conceal the origin of money which they havereason to believe was obtained by criminal means.    But they argued in a submission on the proposals that theduty of care imposed on financial institutions should make themliable for any negligence.    The federal government's proposals, which are beingcirculated for comment before a formal bill is put beforeparliament, would make only gross negligence an offence.    The new legislation, which is aimed mainly at combattingorganised crime, is likely to take effect in the early 1990s. REUTER&#3;
