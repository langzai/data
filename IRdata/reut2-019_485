China and Australia's Victoria statesigned a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminiumprocessing plant in China that will export to South Korea,Australian officials told journalists.    China has no official direct trade or government ties withSeoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea.    China International Trust and Investment Corporation(CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in &lt;Bohai AluminiumIndustries Ltd>, the company to build the rolling mill andextrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said.    It was China's largest joint venture so far, they said.    "A joint venture opens up the potential for penetratingmarkets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),"Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said.    An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue SouthKorean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul isgrowing but is not officially publicised.    Victoria's &lt;Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government,will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which isintended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminiumsmelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs inPortland.    The China-based joint venture would process Portlandaluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domesticChinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.    The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint keymanagers, he said.    Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generatedby their participation would lead to further CITIC investmentin Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level ofindependence from Peking's central government and has extensiveoverseas investments. REUTER&#3;
