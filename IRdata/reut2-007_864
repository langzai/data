The European Community (EC) agreedtough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks andbuses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vaststretches of the region's forests.    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreedmember states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next fewyears the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the mainsource of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, withtougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 andfor all new vehicles from October 1990.    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level ofnitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a yearfrom three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if allheavy vehicles applied to the new standards.    There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use inthe EC, according to Commission figures.    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to movetowards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonnrequested permission to do so to encourage the use oflow-pollution cars, diplomats said.    West Germany will still need ministers' final approval forsuch a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when ECenvironment ministers meet next on May 21.    But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germanydid not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wideban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomatssaid. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk nodamage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states specialpermission if they wish to be exempt from Community competitionlaws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implementa ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol. Reuter&#3;
