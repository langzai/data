New York Federal Reserve BankPresident Gerald Corrigan opposed a further fall in the valueof the dollar but refused to say whether U.S. interest rateswould be raised to protect the currency.    "A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yenat this juncture I would regard as counterproductive," he told anews conference.    His comments echoed those made last week by U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker, who also warned against a further dollarfall.    Currency speculators and investors are convinced that afurther dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge U.S.trade deficit, dealers said, adding the only thing likely tohelp the dollar is seen as a rise in U.S. Interest rates.    Corrigan refused to say whether the U.S. was ready to riskdamaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates.    The dollar's sharp drop this month has also raisedquestions about the usefulness of recent meetings of the Groupof Seven. But Corrigan said: "They have played a constructiverole in so far as the broad objective of facilitating a higherdegree of economic policy coordination." Reuter&#3;
