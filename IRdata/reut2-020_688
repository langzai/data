The U.S. Food and Drug Administrationhas allowed ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc to resume testing itsribavirin experimental AIDS drug, according to ICN.    "Our safety concerns are not of sufficient magnitude towithhold approval of further clinical studies designed toassess the safety and efficacy of ribavirin," the FDA told ICNChairman Milan Panic in an October 16 letter made public byICN.    An FDA spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the letter.    ICN's tests of the drug on humans were blocked last springafter the FDA decided there was insufficient evidence of itseffectiveness against two common AIDS-related conditions.    The tests had been intended to determine whether ribavirinwas effective against AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) andLymphadenopathy Syndrome or LAS.    FDA Commissioner Frank Young disclosed in May, however,that the agency was investigating "suspicious" test resultssubmitted by ICN on the antiviral drug. Young said he hadpersonally scolded ICN officials for making exaggerated claimsabout the drug. In addition, a House subcommittee said it wasprobing ICN for possible trading or financial irregularities.    Today, the FDA said it was letting ICN test ribavirin forsafety and effectiveness in 32 patients with ARC and LAS. Reuter&#3;
