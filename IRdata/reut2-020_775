J.P. Morgan and Co Inc saidthird-quarter net income rose 3.6 pct to 219.2 mln dlrs, from211.5 mln a year earlier, partly because of reduced loan-lossprovisions and a lower income tax bill.    For the first nine months of the year, however, Morganposted a loss of 140.8 mln dlrs, compared with a profit of682.4 mln in the same period of 1986, because it set aside 875mln dlrs in reserves in the second quarter against shakythird-world loans.    The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 20 mlndlrs, down from 70 mln a year earlier.    Morgan's tax bill was 52.4 mln dlrs in the quarter, downfrom 85.3 mln a year earlier, mainly because of benefitsassociated with the second-quarter loan-loss provision.    Net interest earnings fell to 474.3 mln dlrs from 526.5 mlnas net yield narrowed to 2.71 pct from 3.13 pct and 1.3 billiondlrs of Brazilian loans remained on non-accrual.    Non-interest operating income was 296 mln dlrs, up from292.8 mln. Net charge-offs halved to 16 mln dlrs.    Expenses jumped 18 pct to 387.3 mln dlrs, with personnelcosts accounting for half of the increase. The effect of thelower dollar on overseas costs was also a factor. Reuter&#3;
