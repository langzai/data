Tanzania's ruling Chama chaMapinduzi (CCM) party has endorsed the government's economicreform programme but said it did not think more changes, suchas a further devaluation of the shilling, would be needed.    Tanzania has devalued the shilling more than 65 pct in lessthan a year and has started to overhaul inefficient governmentfirms in line with a package agreed with the IMF.    The CCM's national executive committee said it wassatisfied with government efforts to implement IMF conditions."Measures taken so far are satisfactory and there is no need totake other ones -- the devaluation of the shilling included," itsaid.    The committee's statement was in response to a governmentreport on the IMF package submitted last Thursday. Reuter&#3;
