The United States told India itcould purchase a supercomputer because U.S. concerns over apossible security breach had been removed.    U.S. officials said the United States did not specify whichsupercomputer it was willing to sell but had offered India achoice.    They declined to comment on a newspaper report that theUnited States wanted to sell India a computer less powerfulthan the Indians had sought.    They said the United States was awaiting a response fromNew Delhi.    The New York Times, quoting unnamed government and industryofficials, said the United States wanted to sell a weaker-modelsupercomputer to India.    U.S. and Indian negotiatiors reached a tentative agreementin December on security precautions for the sale of thecomputer, which has a wide variety of military applications.    "We have told the Indians that we ratify the tentativeagreement reached in December," a U.S. official said.    India proposed to use the supercomputer to analyze weatherpatterns to forecast monsoons.    The sale of a U.S. supercomputer to a non-Western nation israre. This transaction was seen as a test of atechnology-sharing agreement signed by Prime Minister RajivGandhi and President Reagan in 1985.    The American concern was that the advanced technology mightfall into the hands of the Soviet Union, which is India's mainweapons supplier.    One condition calls for U.S. personnel to service thecomputer in India for three years, a Pentagon spokesman said.    The spokesman predicted the negotiations, which alsoinvolved the State Department, could be quickly resolved.    The only countries which make the supercomputer are theUnited States and Japan.    In New Delhi, Indian officials told Reuters that a U.S.offer had been made.    "An announcement will be made in 10 days to two weeks time,"an official said. Reuter&#3;
