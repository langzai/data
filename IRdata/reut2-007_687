Analyst Thomas McCrann of MerrillLynch said he reiterated a "buy" recommendation of WangLaboratories Inc, noting that a successful cost cuttingcampaign could reduce the earnings loss expected for the thirdquarter ending in March.    Wang was the most actively traded stock on the AmericanStock Exchange, rising 3/4 to 16-5/8.    McCrann said that "Wang is a little bit ahead of where theywere expected to be in their cost reductions, and as a result,the odds have increased that the loss for the quarter will beless than had been expected."    McCrann said he expects Wang to report break even earningsper share or only a small loss per share for the third quarter.    He said for the year, however, the company should report aloss of about 50 cts a share compared with earnings of about 35cts a share a year ago. Reuter&#3;
