Republican members of the HouseBudget Committee refused to cast their votes as the committeebegan marking up the outlines of next year's federal budget.    Republicans voted "present" during votes on a ceiling forfiscal 1988 defense spending, saying they were protesting theDemocrats' failure to present an alternative to PresidentReagan's budget, which was completed in January.    Without the Republicans' votes, the Democratic majority onthe committee voted tentatively 13-8 to cap 1988 defensespending at 282.6 billion dlrs, three billion dlrs more thancurrent year defense outlays.    Rep. William Gray (D-Pa.), the Budget Committee chairman,decided earlier this week to use current government spendinglevels as a starting point for the panel's deliberations.    In the past, the committee Democrats had always gone behindclosed doors to agree in advance on a draft budget plan.    But this year, the Democrats could not come to anagreement, prompting Gray to invite the Republicans to jointhem in the drafting process in open session.    Republicans argued that this maneuver enabled the Democratsto avoid presenting alternatives to the president's budget. Reuter&#3;
