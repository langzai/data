Australia's current account deficit forFebruary is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mlnand one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29billion, market economists polled by Reuters said.    Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.    The economists said a key element in the narrowing would bea reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January,after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598mln dlrs.    As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which roseabout 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.    A lack of aircraft imports in February should alsocontribute on the trade account although it is still likely toremain in deficit, the economists said.    Other positive influences on the current account balanceshould be a decline in the invisibles deficit following aseasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out ofcertain official aid payments, they said.    They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched aneight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unlessthe current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.
