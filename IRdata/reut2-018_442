Secretary of State George Shultz saidthe U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit fasterthan many predicted, and the consequences for its tradepartners might be traumatic.    "The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustmentnecessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance inorder to service our growing foreign debt," he told a conferenceattended by the six members of the Association of SoutheastAsian Nations and their leading Western friends.    "In my view, this will happen more rapidly than manyobservers now predict."    "The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth isbecoming less effective," Shultz said.    "It is not arithmetically possible for every country in theworld to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit,which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into whicheveryone's export-led strategy for growth has gone."    "The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed onthis deficit, so something will have to give and it will bepossibly a traumatic experience," he added.    "While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschewprotectionist policies, you must act too," Shultz said.    "I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leaveour door open to imports if more of our trading partners opentheir doors wider," he told the group, which includedrepresentatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand andthe European Community.
