Canada plans to monitor steel shipmentsflowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appeaseconcerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steelexports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.    "To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market,the government is taking further action to ensure we have moreaccurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is notused as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,"Carney said.    Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked toexercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries wereconsidering establishing a joint commission to study thegrowing steel problem.    Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce anamendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up themonitoring program.    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pctcent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double thelevel just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time ofgrowing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports fromseveral countries in the face of a decline in the domesticsteel industry.    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of theAmerican market be limited to 2.4 pct. Reuter&#3;
