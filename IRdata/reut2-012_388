The maximum rebate granted atyesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked nochange in policy towards producers' complaints that they arelosing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sourcessaid.    They said this was despite the fact that the commissionaccepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into interventionyesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being settoo low.    The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecusper 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.    London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largestever granted. The commission sources said today the increasewas entirely explained by world market conditions. The amountby which the rebate fell short of what producers claim isneeded to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales intointervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.    Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar intointervention last month to protest at rebates which they saidwere too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of Frenchsugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, theremainder being rejected as of too low quality.    The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offersin the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar andpayment for it.    They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet,adding that they would expect operators to wait another week ortwo to review commission policy before making up their minds.    The sources said the commission felt entitled to offerrebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiablein the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal toreduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start ofthe new season in July.
