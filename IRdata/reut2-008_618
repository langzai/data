The U.S. Has offered warships toescort Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf past Iranian anti-shipmissile batteries, Defence Department officials said.    The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was madelast week by Navy Admiral William Crowe, chairman of thePentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a Middle East visit.    Reagan administration officials said later that Washingtondid not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would notlet Iran use Chinese-made "Silkworm" anti-ship missiles, capableof covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oilshipments to the West.    Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection forup to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be providedby three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in thesouthern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.    In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's smallMideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon hasmoved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk,into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month.    White House and defence officials said that massing thefleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq waror Iran's stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.    The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been toldabout U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in theGulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, whichrepresents U.S. Interests in Iran.    Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended tothreaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference inthe region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said onSunday.    Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulfby Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war,an offshoot of their 6-1/2-year-old ground conflict. REUTER&#3;
