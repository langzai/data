President Corazon Aquino said economicgrowth took priority over debt repayments but she sought todispel fears that the Philippines would not honour a Julyagreement rescheduling 13.2 billion dlrs of debt.    In a speech to 13 major business groups, Aquino said, "Ourpolicy has been very clear fm the start -- growth must takepriority, for the plain and simple reason that if we have nomoney to pay, we can't. And if we starve the nation ofessential services, there may be no one around to honour thedebt."    Aquino said her officials would try to get all 483 creditorbanks to sign the debt rescheduling pact by the November 15effective date.    "That should end speculation and remove at least one excusefor hoarding dollars," Aquino said.    Violent fluctuations in the peso's exchange rate and theend of a 17-month bull run in local stock markets havetriggered dollar-hoarding.    Aquino said the country's foreign debt, which rose tonearly 29 billion dlrs in April, was growing even without freshborrowing.    Debt servicing took up 40 pct of the budget and 45 pct ofexport earnings, Aquino said. Over the next six years, thePhilippines would be paying its creditors 20 billion dlrs whilegetting only four billion dlrs in new loans.    Aquino acknowledged there were grave doubts about hergovernment's ambitious privatisation program.    "There is always an excuse for government not to sell," shesaid, but she added: "I want government to get out of business."She said non-performing assets would be sold in open biddingand Filipinos and foreigners would compete on equal terms.
