The dollar was steady ahead of a seriesof meetings of leading finance ministers starting today inWashington, despite low expectations for the outcome of thetalks and still negative underlying sentiment toward thedollar.    "There's too much disagreement between the Japanese and therest for them to come out with anything unanimous," said oneU.K. Merchant bank trader, reflecting the general tone.    However, dealers said position squaring helped push thedollar to a final 1.8240/50 marks, up from the opening1.8195/205 and near yesterday's close of 1.8245/55.    Meanwhile, the pound was underpinned by today's opinionpoll findings of further strong support for the ConservativeParty, but fear of Bank of England intervention limited buying.    Dealers said they doubted the U.K. Central bank had neededto sell sterling to curb rises today, with the markets soquiet. The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold poundsyesterday.    Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index,unchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday'sfinish. It closed at 1.6185/95 dlrs, after an opening 1.6213/23and previous close of 1.6163/73, and at 2.9490/520 marks,against an opening 2.9540/75 and yesterday's 2.9490/530.    Traders said there was little hope that the Westernfinanciers will be able to find a lasting solution to theproblem of currency instability during the current series oftalks in Washington.    These are scheduled to start today with an informal Groupof Five (G-5) session.    Tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting - of the U.S., Japan,West Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Canada - is seen asthe key meeting.    Traders said few operators will be prepared to openpositions ahead of news emerging from the talks.    However, some traders said that, given the low level ofexpectations, the market could be particularly susceptible tosigns of accord between the U.S. And Japan, which would givethe dollar a sharp upward push.    They said interest is still largely centred on the yen,with any fresh dollar weakness expected to show in that marketfirst.    Meanwhile, today's comments from U.S. Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volcker failed to have a lasting impact on themarket. His statement that a further sizeable dollar fall couldbe counter-productive aided a brief run-up in mid-afternoon,but there was little followthrough, traders said.    The dollar finished at 145.25/35 yen, up from an opening145.05/15 but below yesterday's European close of 146.00/10.    It ended at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs, against the start of1.5130/40 and previous final 1.5180/90, and at 6.0650/700French francs, after beginning at 6.0525/75 and endingyesterday at 6.0660/710.
