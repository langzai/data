The outcome of today's European Community(EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict afterlast week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highestever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100kilos, traders said.    Some said they believed the tonnage would probably besmaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a viewon the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commissionaccepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operatorsprotesting about low rebates. This might be a determiningfactor in today's result, they added.
