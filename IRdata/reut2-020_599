CIP Inc, wholly-owned by CanadianPacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas whichwould use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president CecilSlenniken said in an interview.     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and wasartificially developed several years ago. The plant, which hasbeen grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet inthree months and is said to produce better quality newsprintthan wood pulp, a CIP official said.     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre butwould need partners to begin the project.    "We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions ofdollars it would take for such a project," Slenniken said.     He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis tomake newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pctsoftwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.    CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recentlylaunched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metrictonnes per year by fall of 1989.
