The business climate in West Germanmanufacturing industry worsened slightly last month afterdeteriorating markedly in January, the IFO economic researchinstitute said.    It said its February survey showed firms were alsoincreasingly pessimistic about the outlook for the comingmonths, causing them to cut back production plans.    IFO blamed the worsening of the business climate andoutlook largely on expectations of further declines in foreigndemand.    More than a quarter of the firms polled said they thoughtorders in hand were insufficient.    Overall, the business climate in February could bedescribed as just short of satisfactory, IFO said.    In a breakdown of responses by industrial sector, theinstitute said manufacturers of basic products judged thebusiness climate to be slightly less favourable in Februarythan in January. For the coming months they expect exportprospects to dim and production to fall, it added.    Chemical firms reported a slight improvement in demand butthey increasingly said orders on hand were insufficient.    The business climate in the capital goods industry wasunchanged in February compared with January, but IFO said thiswas due entirely to positive reports from makers of commercialvehicles.    Demand in the capital goods sector was generally describedas weak, with the outlook in February cloudier than it had beenin January, the institute said.

Carmakers wereagain positive about current business but forecast a slightworsening of business conditions in the near future.
