France's economic recovery will takeseveral years, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur told theEconomic and Social Council (CES), an advisory body composed ofindustrialists, trade unionists and representatives of othersectors of the French economy.    "We will bear for long years to come the weight of thechoices made at the start of the oil crisis about 15 years ago,unfavorable choices for industries but favorable forhouseholds," he said without elaborating.    "It is the cost of this choice that our industries are stillhaving to bear. We must improve their competitivity to regaingrowth and employment," Balladur added.    Balladur said the French budget deficit must be reduced tobelow 70 billion francs from 129 billion forecast for 1987 buthe gave no time-scale. He has already announced his intentionof cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989.    He said France's public debt, expected to grow by 10 pctthis year compared with 1,300 billion francs in 1986, must notincrease by more than between 60 to 70 billion francs a year.    He reaffirmed that income from the government's sweepingprivatization program, seen to be at least 30 billion francsfor 1987, must be used mainly to pay off French state debt andnot to finance current needs.
