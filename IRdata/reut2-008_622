A huge car bomb exploded at theheadquarters of the British Army of the Rhine last night,injuring about 30 people just hours after British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher left the West German capital.    A British Army spokeswoman said today that seven peoplewere still being treated for minor injuries in hospitals in theMoenchengladbach area, near the Rheindahlen base, after beingbeing hit by flying shards of glass from the blast.    The 100-kg bomb went off outside an officers' mess at 10.30P.M. (2130 GMT), ripping a crater half a meter (1.5 feet) deepand three meters (nine feet) wide in the ground, and could beheard several kilometers (miles) away, a police spokesman said.    An anonymous caller, speaking English, telephoned the WestGerman domestic news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur just beforethe explosion and said a bomb was about to go off at the base.    Thatcher left Bonn early yesterday evening after talks withwith Chancellor Helmut Kohl ahead of her visit to Moscow nextweek. She had flown to West Germany from talks with FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand in Normandy earlier in the day.    Officers of the Nato Northern Army Group, which is alsobased at Rheindahlen, were holding a social dinner attended byBritish and West German servicemen and their wives inside themess when the bomb went off.
