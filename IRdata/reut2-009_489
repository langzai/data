The National Highway TransportationSafety Administration said it granted a request by Ford MotorCo to delay for four years until 1994 a requirement that airbags or other passive restraint systems be installed on thepassenger side of the front seat of all new autombiles.    Under the decision announced today by TransportationSecretary Elizabeth Dole, automakers will be required to meetfederal passive restraint requirements only on the driver'sside. "The action we are taking today will result in theinstallation of more air bags, sooner than would have occurredwithout this rule," Dole said.    Under the ruling announced today, 10 pct of model year 1987cars must have automatic seat belts or air bags on the driver'sside. For the 1988 model year, 25 pct must have passiverestraints, and for 1989, 40 pct must be so equipped.    By the 1990 model year, all new cars must be equipped withpassive restraint systems on the driver's side.    For the passenger side of the front seat, ordinary seatbelts will suffice until 1994 under the new ruling. Aspreviously written, the federal standard required passiverestraint systems such as air bags on both the driver's andpassenger's side of the front seat in all new cars by 1990. Reuter&#3;
