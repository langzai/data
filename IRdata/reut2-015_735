Ugandan Finance Minister ChrispusKiyonga has asked the National Resistance Council, thecountry's interim parliament, to approve 1,000 billionshillings (714 mln dlrs) in extra government spending over thelast three months of this financial year, council sources said.    Kiyonga told the council that because of high inflation,estimated to be running at over 150 per cent a year, thegovernment needed extra money to keep its services runninguntil the financial year ends on June 30.    The new appropriation requested by the minister is almostas much as the 1,127 billion shillings (805 mln dlrs) thegovernment expected to spend during the whole year.    Kiyonga said the government was having trouble keeping tothe deficit target of 350 billion shillings (250 mln dlrs)contained in the original budget announced last August. Thedeficit was to be financed by borrowing.    The minister did not give a new budget deficit estimate. Reuter&#3;
