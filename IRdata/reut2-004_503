Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remainconcerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.    "A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern,both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve," he said inremarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leadershere.    He said one potential channel for renewed inflationarypressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in theexchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.    He said participants in financial markets and businessremain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.    "Should the skepticism about our ability to resistinflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences forinterest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economygenerally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of thatdanger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation ofmonetary policy," the Fed chairman said.    Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower wouldundermine the hard won gains against inflation and would riskdissipating the flow of foreign capital. Reuter&#3;
