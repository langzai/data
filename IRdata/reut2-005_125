Baird Corp said its independentdirectors adopted a plan under which one stock purchase rightwill be distributed as a dividend on each common share tostockholders of record March 23.    The plan is designed to protect shareholders againstunsolicited or coercive takeover attempts.    The rights, which would allow holders to buy one-half shareof common for 20 dlrs, will be exercisable if a suitor acquires25 pct or more of the company's common as of today or 30 pct ata later date, or if such a holder begins a tender offer toacquire the company, or in other circumstances.    Under certain conditions, the rights will allow holders tobuy stock in a surviving company at half price.    Baird can redeem the rights at five cts apiece subject tocertain conditions, it said.
