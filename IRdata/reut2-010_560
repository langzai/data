Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun saidplans to scrap the country's parallel currency, ForeignExchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due toobjections from foreign businessmen and others.    But Tian told a news conference the Chinese governmentstill considered FECs unsatisfactory.    Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs,Tian said: "We have decided to postpone the question. As towhether it will be done in the future, it will be doneaccording to the evolution of the situation."    He said many people, including foreign businessmen, hadraised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, andadded: "It is rather complicated."    The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners inChina. But they now circulate widely among local residents andthere is a big black market in the currency, though it istheoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency,renminbi.    Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had"many demerits and negative influences."    Bank of China President Wang Deyan told Reuters earlierthis month that he thought it unlikely that the certificateswould be scrapped this year.    Western diplomats and economists have said the Chineseauthorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative.    Vice-Premier Yao Yilin announced at a similar pressconference last year that the FECs would be abolished, sayingthe government had decided it was ideologically unacceptable tohave two currencies circulating in China at the same time.
