Companhia Nacional de Petroquimica EP(CNP), the Portugese state-owned oil refinery andpetrochemicals company, has awarded a mandate to Bank ofAmerica International Ltd and Manufacturers Hanover Ltd toarrange a 250 mln dlr loan, banking sources said.    The loan will be for eight years and proceeds will be usedto refinance existing debt.    Interest will be at 12.5 basis points above the LondonInterbank Offered Rate (Libor) for the first four years, withthe margin rising to 15 basis points in the last four years. Noother fees were immediately available.    Bankers noted that CNP has faced significant financialproblems over the past year as a result of investments in areaswhich proved to be unprofitable.    Portugal is attempting to maintain its position in thepetrochemical industry and is undertaking a restructuring ofCNP, which involves the divestment of certain unprofitableassets.    Partly because of these problems, the new loan carries a"letter of support and assumption" under which the Republic wouldassume the obligations of CNP should it be unable to meet anypayments or cease to exist.    Furthermore, bankers noted that this financing covers allof CNP's existing debt, some of which was state-guaranteed butsome of which was not.    The existing loans had maturities of about seven to 10years and carried interest margins of between 3/8 and 5/8 pct.    By consolidating the loans and covering them with theRepublic's support, the borrower was able to obtain a reductionin the margins on the new loan, bankers said. REUTER&#3;
