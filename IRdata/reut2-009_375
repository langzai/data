BAT Industries Plc &lt;BTI.L> 1986 results,which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed thecompany was in a strong position and that its shares wereprobably undervalued, share analysts said.    BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon tradingafter a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538pearlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39billion pre-tax.    Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stockmarket plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BATshares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in theshare price.    "In the current market, people almost expect companies tobeat expectations," said one analyst, adding that pretax profitsof 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.    BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985pretax profit of 1.17 billion.    Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from itsunderperforming industries and the decreasing share of thetobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.    BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that thetobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74pct four years ago.    Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the companydeclining further as other sectors increased in importance.    He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financialservices, in particular in the U.S.    Sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" insight in the near future.    Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in theU.K. Insurance area was encouraging.    Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to makemajor acquisitions, they said. Reuter&#3;
