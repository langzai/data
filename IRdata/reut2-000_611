The U.S. Department of Transportation(DOT) has concluded that a ban on smoking on all domesticairline flights is not justified at this time.    The department made known its conclusions in a report toCongress, made public today, on a recommendation by theNational Academy of Sciences that such a ban be adopted.    "We agree that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke couldbe viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers. However, webelieve that further study is needed before the department canpropose a definitive response to this recommendation," the DOTreport said.    The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) had studied theissue of smoking on airlines under a DOT grant.    It recommended a ban in August after concluding thattobacco smoke, when confined to an airliner's cabin, posedpotential health hazards to cabin crew members, irritated passengers and crew, and created a risk of fires.    The DOT said more study was needed of the health effects ofenvironmental tobacco smoke and of the concentration anddistribution of pollutants on various aircraft types.    It also called for more study of possible changes inaircraft ventilation systems and said it wanted to spend moretime considering whether a ban should be extended to international as well as domestic flights.
