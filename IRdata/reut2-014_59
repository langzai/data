Up to 70 pct of the 240 financecompanies operating in Sweden are likely to be squeezed outover the next few years by the deregulation of financialmarkets, the Association of Swedish Finance Companies said.    Association chairman Arne Ogren told a news conference thata major restructuring of the sector was inevitable.    Central Bank governor Bengt Dennis said when announcing thederegulation in November 1985 that one of his main aims was togive commercial banks a chance to compete on equal terms withfinance companies and so undermine Sweden's "grey market."    Total credit granted by the Swedish finance companies roseto 77 billion crowns in 1986 from 64.7 billion in 1985. Thisincludes leasing and is the equivalent of 19 pct of alloutstanding loans by the banking sector at end-1986.    Ogren said that if proposals now being discussed by agovernment-appointed inquiry into the credit market to licensefinance companies and make them increase their share capitalwere pushed through, up to 70 pct would disappear.    But he said this would in fact have little effect on creditvolumes as the 42 biggest finance companies accounted for 70pct of lending by the entire sector.    The explosive growth of Swedish finance companies began inthe early 1970s and commercial banks even started their own toget around the tight restrictions then imposed on bankingactivities and particularly on the growth of lending.    Now that they were on an equal footing with their parentcompanies, many bank-owned finance companies faced an identitycrisis, Ogren said. He predicted there would be mergers andindividual firms would carve out specialised niches to ensuretheir survival in a deregulated climate.    Ogren said the sector's losses on bad loans were bound torise steeply in 1989-1990 due to the rush to increase credit. REUTER&#3;
