The Dutch Finance Ministry said it isdiscussing with foreign fiscal authorities, primarily WestGerman and Belgian, possible means to combat evasion of tax oninterest payments received abroad.    Finance Minister Onno Ruding told parliament yesterday heaimed in 1988 to recoup about 100 mln guilders in tax revenueon interest income both at home and abroad, and a further 300mln by the end of 1990.    He expected Dutch banks soon to start automaticallyreporting interest payments they make, but this could promptmore investors to open foreign accounts, Ruding said.    There are no restrictions on Dutch capital flows, and theministry was therefore seeking co-operation from fiscalauthorities abroad to monitor interest paid on accounts held byDutch citizens, said spokesman Jaap Weeda.    Ruding was largely motivated by guidelines laid down in thecentre-right government's policy plan which calls for theministry to boost its income by one billion guilders by 1990.    Weeda said it was difficult to estimate taxation lostthrough undeclared interest income, but Ministry figuresindicated that about 20 pct of such income was not declared.    Ruding told parliament Dutch banks seemed willing toco-operate in plans to report on interest payments, but theyforesaw practical problems.    There was no firm target date for introducing reportingprocedures, but Ruding was adamant it must happen soon.    "I cannot and will not accept any delay," he said. REUTER&#3;
