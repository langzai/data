The water supply outlook for most ofthe Western U.S. states this summer looks dim, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    Snowpack and precipitation were well below normalthroughout much of the West as of last week.    Eight of the 12 states in which the department collectsdata reported snowpack and precipitation at three-quarters orless of normal.    It said unless late winter snows or spring rains bringrelief, these states can expect possible water shortages thissummer.    Major water users, including agricultural producers,municipalities and industry, should begin conservation measuresnow to avoid water rationing later, USDA said.    The department said California, one of the country's majoragricultural producers, is the driest, with snowpack andprecipitation so far this year at less than half of normal.    Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon andWashington also report significant shortages despite pockets ofnear normal to above noral rainfall in some areas, thedepartment said.    Arizona and Alaska have higher than normal snowpack andprecipitation, while Colorado and New Mexico are near normal,it said.    The western water supply forecast is based on the latestsnow surveys and analyses of precipitation data by thedepartment and the National Weather Service. Reuter&#3;
