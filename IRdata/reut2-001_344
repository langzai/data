The U.S. Agriculture Departmentproposes to rename the "USDA Good" grade of beef to "USDA Select."    The department said the proposed change is in response to apetition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and wouldpresent a more positive image of this grade of beef and helpcalorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat.    Under current rules, the "good" grade of meat has lessmarbling and fat than the "prime" or "choice" grades, it said.    Standards for all of the grades would remain unchangedunder the proposal.
