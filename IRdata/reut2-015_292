The Senate unanimously approvedlegislation to lift a ban on new construction of naturalgas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burningplants.    The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairmanBennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing ofnatural gas which was designed to protect residential consumersfrom major price increases by forcing some industrial users topay higher than market prices.    "This legislation will open up new natural gas markets," theLousiana Democrat said.    The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to ashortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.    "Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"Johnston said.    In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires newbaseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodatemodifications necessary to burning coal or another alternatefuel. Reuter&#3;
