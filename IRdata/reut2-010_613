Dry areas of the Australian sugar canebelt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enoughrain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar ProducersAssociation spokesman said.    The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, butrainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains areneeded in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackayregions, he said from Brisbane.    Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the stateand in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking verygood after heavy falls this month, he said.    The spokesman said it is still too early to tell whateffect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, whichis harvested from around June to December.    He said frequent but light falls in the areas that areshort of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only needabout three days of the region's heavy tropical rains torestore normal moisture to the cane.    But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucialto the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.    "It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but itmight be in a month without some good falls," he said. REUTER&#3;
