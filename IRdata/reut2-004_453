A Federal Communications Commission(FCC) board recommended raising the two-dollar monthlysubscriber line charge for residential telephone customers by1.50 dlrs over the next two years.    The subscriber line charge was first levied by the FCC inJune, 1985, in an effort to more acurately reflect the cost ofproviding phone service as a part of phone deregulation.    The recommendation by the board, composed of federal andstate utility regulators, was expected to be approved by theFCC in a seperate decision in the next few weeks.    The subscriber line charge for residences and businesseswith single phone lines will rise to 2.60 dlrs in June 1987,3.20 in September 1988, and 3.50 dlrs in April 1989.    The staff of the FCC said at a public meeting that theincrease in the charge would make possible a reduction inlong-distance phone rates of 15 pct or 17 billion dlrs over sixyears.    Supporters of the subscriber line charge have argued thatlong distance phone rates had been subsidizing local phoneservice, which would lead to abandonment of the phone networkby large commercial phone customers.
