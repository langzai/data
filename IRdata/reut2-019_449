South Korea's ruling party announced areform package which includes a recommendation for directpresidential elections.    There was no immediate reaction from President Chun DooHwan but Democratic Justice Party (DJP) chairman Roh Tae-woo,who unveiled the reforms, vowed to resign if they wererejected.    Roh, whose confirmation as government candidate to succeedChun sparked weeks of massive demonstrations around thecountry, said he would withdraw his candidacy and quit his DJPpost if Chun failed to accept the package.    "I have reached the conclusion that I cannot but choose thedirect presidential election system to overcome socialconfusion and achieve national compromise," Roh said.    There was no immediate indication of how soon Chun wouldreact to Roh's proposals or whether he was involved in theirformulation.    The president, who took office in 1980 following a militarycoup, is due to step down next February after elections whichhad tentatively been set for December.    Under Roh's package, Chun would remain president until hissuccessor was chosen by direct elections. At present, thepresident is chosen through an electoral college system whichthe opposition says is stacked in favour of the DJP.    Among other major changes, the package offers a release ofmost political prisoners, a guarantee of human rights and afree press.    Kim Young-sam, head of the opposition ReunificationDemocratic Party, said, "I wholeheartedly welcome Chairman Roh'sannouncement, though it was a belated measure."    A Western diplomat told Reuters "It's a very substantial,very courageous move."    The second surprise in Roh's proposals was an amnesty forleading dissident Kim Dae-jung, who has been banned frompolitics because of a suspended sentence for sedition charges.    The only opposition demand which is not met by Roh'spackage is the RDP's insistence that Chun should step downimmediately. REUTER&#3;
