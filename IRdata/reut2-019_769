U.S. firms are expected to enjoy theadvantage of superior experience over their Japanesecompetitors in the new, promising business of bringing assetrich Japanese investors to the U.S. financial futures markets.    Japan allowed local financial institutions last month tostart using overseas futures in currencies, bonds and stocks tohelp them manage their bulging foreign portfolios.    "U.S. investment banks are going to take advantage. We'vebeen in the business for two decades, the Japanese have not,"said Eugene Atkinson, president of Goldman, Sachs Japan Corp.       Japanese investors were assumed to be eager to get into thenew markets, but in fact participation so far has been slow,Japanese securities and bank sources in New York said.    Koichi Kane, Executive Vice President of Nomura SecuritiesInternational, said, "They're still in a starting up period."    "They're testing the water," Atkinson added. But once theystart, the Japanese are likely to become very big players,opening up lucrative business opportunities, he said.    U.S. investment banking sources said the slow start isunderstandable because U.S. institutional investors, too, arefairly new to the market.       Futures markets have a long history in the U.S., butbecause of the high risks involved American pension funds andmutual funds were not allowed to use the markets untilrelatively recently, a U.S. investment bank futures analystsaid.    In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures,an insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamedfor the slow start, the Japanese sources said.       Japan is liberalizing its financial markets, but domesticfinancial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokersin Japan for overseas futures markets.    This may change next year, when bankers speculate thatsecurities houses will be permitted to enter this line ofbusiness.    While the Japanese are out of the business, the Americanshave moved in, with First Boston Corp, Salomon Brothers Inc,Goldman, Sachs and Co, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc andPainWebber Inc leading the charge, they said.       In the U.S., Nikko Securities Co International Inc ispreparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad ofTrade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand forfutures products, Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said.    Nomura, Japan's largest securities house, has not yetdecided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in theU.S. to establish closer links between Japanese investors andthe U.S. futures markets, Kane said.    The evening session of CBT, inaugurated recently tocoincide with early Tokyo business hours, has increasedJapanese participation to some extent, but the brokerage issueis still a hurdle, the Japanese sources said.       High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futuresmarket, so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytimetrading session in Chicago if possible, they said.    The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers andestablishing channels to pay fees and margins, but harmonizingclerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo andChicago are proving to be a burden, the sources said.    Some Japanese banks, which are largely barred from thesecurities industry in Japan, have contemplated buying into theU.S. brokerage business, the Japanese sources said.        One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions,which was also a spur for U.S. commercial banks to get into thebrokerage business, they said.    "The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house orto go into a business tie-up," said Hiroyuki Kondo of YasudaTrust and Banking Co Ltd in New York.    One trust bank source said total fees could amount toaround one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures marketsfully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets.    Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressivelymany foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammothcapital assets, but the futures brokerage business to be adifferent story, Japanese banking sources said.    They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition todifficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers.    In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future, some U.S.brokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13dlrs per contract, below the break-even level, they said.    Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying toapproach Japanese financial institutions about possibletie-ups, a futures indusry source in Chicago said.    But Japanese bank sources in New York said the smallcapital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanesenervous about a capital link.    Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokeragebusiness once financial futures trading by the Japanese startsgrowing fast and proves to be profitable, they said.    But the big question, they added, is whether the Japanesegovernment would let banks engage in this new risky business. reuter&#3;
