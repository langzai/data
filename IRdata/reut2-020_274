Donald Regan, President Reagan'sformer chief of staff, said the government should loosen themoney supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reducethe federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.    "I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve oureconomy," the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc&lt;MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.    "We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest ratesdown. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're goingto have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficitand the trade deficit," Regan said.     "I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particularmoment," Regan said when asked about the prospects for arecession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.    "I think that if they were to do that, they'd create thesame conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the moneysupply and what happened? We went into a major recession. Ithink that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now."    Regan also called on the government to impose restrictionson program trading. "I think that that's exacerbated,exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that theymust stop," he said. Reuter&#3;
