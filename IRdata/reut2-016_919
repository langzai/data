The Japanese government is consideringbuying U.S.-made supercomputers to help defuse mounting tradefriction between the two countries, Trade Minister HajimeTamura was quoting as saying.    Japanese officials said Tamura told visiting U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter that the government may setaside money for the purchase of the supercomputers in asupplementary budget to be drawn up later this year.    But he emphasised that the matter was still under study andthat no firm decision had been made.    Tamura urged Yeutter to lift the trade sanctions imposedagainst Japan and argued that the yen's rapid rise was alreadyworking to correct the country's trade imbalance.    But, according to Japanese officials, Yeutter held outlittle hope that the American trade sanctions would be liftedsoon and said the United States needed action from Japan toboost its domestic demand and imports, not just words.    In order to lift the tariffs imposed on 300 mln dlrs worthof Japanese exports last Friday, the U.S. Needs proof that itsjoint computer chip pact with Japan is working. And that willtake time, Yeutter was quoted as telling Tamura. REUTER&#3;
