They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added atabout 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move.It had been 3.80/90 on Friday.    The move came as call money extended a rise begun Fridayafter the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to itby other European central banks after currency interventions inthe framework of European Monetary System in January.    Rates could ease further in trading today but dealersexpect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying outfunds for tax payments on behalf of clients.    Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market thismonth, with the bulk being paid out next week.    In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stockedup reserves at the Bundesbank.    On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were wellabove the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserveholdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion.    The daily average reserve holdings were above the level ofaround 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the requireddaily average for the month.    With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely toremain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reservesthan is absolutely necessary.    However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to beadded next week to replace a facility expiring then couldsomewhat offset the drain.    The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said. REUTER&#3;
