Three months ended official ring dealings at 805.50 stg,down 2.50 stg a tonne from yesterday afternoon's kerb close,and the dollar equivalent traded from 1,299 on the pre-marketdown to 1,293 dlrs at the end of the rings and compared with1,298 yesterday.    The nearby covering was prompted by supply tightnesscreated by likely large April option declarations but noreports circulated this morning of any further enquiry forshort term April options.
