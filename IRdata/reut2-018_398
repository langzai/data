The Venice summit accord gives theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) increased responsibility insmoothing vital economic cooperation between industrialcountries, a senior IMF official said.    The official, who met reporters but asked not to beidentified, made clear that the use of a series of economicmeasurements to monitor the seven leading industrialdemocracies would be difficult but was a major step incooperation.    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,Italy and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series ofeconomic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in anattempt to increase cooperation on economic policy.    The setting of a formal process of review, while seen as astep forward in the cooperative effort, was also criticisedbecause it lacked teeth to force a country to change economicbehaviour that hurt other countries.    But the official said influences and peer pressure couldhave a major impact in reforming an erring country.    Economists generally believe a cooperative economicapproach by the largest countries will have a salutory impacton the global economy, including helping the poorest debtorcountries.    The official said the IMF function would be to warncountries when their economic behaviour was straying badly andtry to persuade them to modify it. "I hope it will be a yellowlight, not a red flag," he said.    He also said he hoped negotiations would begin in the nextfew weeks to increase the IMF's structural adjustment facility,which helps 62 of the world's poorest countries.    The facility, approved about 15 months ago, is currentlyfinanced at about 3.8 billion dlrs, but this would be tripledunder the plan.    He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be verydifficult, with countries pressing each other to do more andfinding reasons to reduce their own exposure. "They will betremendously difficult negotiations," he said. REUTER&#3;
