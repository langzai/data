Venezuela plans to have a public sectorforeign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when thepresent government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term,public finances director Jorge Marcano said.    He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billiondlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageableamount which will assist in development plans.    The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bankadvisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year reschedulingaccord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct.    In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano saidhe thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to dowith the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decisionto suspend interest payments.    "I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of theU.S. Government, which urged several major banks to softentheir position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazilannouncement came later," he said.    Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile,objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pactwith Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day beforeVenezuela's.    Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditorsseeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans,which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. "Wecannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the newagreement and present the financing programmes we have," hesaid, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.    Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreignborrowing, which would come from banks and multilateralagencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the nexttwo years. According to the restructured accord, this wouldwork out at around 2.5 billion dlrs. REUTER&#3;
