The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrierCumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, wascarrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange saidthe vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New SouthWales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morningtrading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamentalnews due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and lowstocks.    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentratescould convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although thisdepended on the quality of the concentrates.    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supplypipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Suppliesthere have been very tight this year and there is a strike atone major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently beingheld at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining andSmelting Ltd.
