Portugal's Agriculture Minister AlvaroBarreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the stategrain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals importtenders open to private traders.    Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmittedto the tenders.    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to theEuropean Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reducedby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.    Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon'scivil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this monththat EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done,in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.    As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.    Barreto said, "My objective is put EPAC into the tendersbecause it has a right to take part." He added the governmentwould be studying the court order to see whether or not theruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.    Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator,whether public or private, from the tenders. Private tradershad argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in thePortuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.    "There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,"Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission hadaccepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.    The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation inthe public tenders was unfair competition and violated theclauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with thegradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.
