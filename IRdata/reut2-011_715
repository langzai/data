The Bank of England said it had invitedan early round of bill offers from the discount houses afterforecasting a shortage of around 1.2 billion stg in the moneymarket today.    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills forrepurchase by the market will drain some 526 mln stg whilebills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasurybills will remove around 1.79 billion stg. A rise in notecirculation will take out a further 105 mln stg.    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactionswill add around 1.01 billion stg and bankers' balances abovetarget some 185 mln stg. REUTER&#3;
