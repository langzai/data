Central Bank governor Chang Chi-chengdefended Taiwan's policy of holding a large amount of itsforeign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars, citing similarpolicies followed by countries such as West Germany and Japan.    The reserves, now a record 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, are theworld's largest after those of West Germany and Japan. About 90pct is held in U.S. Dollars and the rest in yen and marks.    Chang's remarks to parliament were in response to a call onMonday by about 20 members of the parliament who asked thegovernment to diversify into other currencies, including yen,marks and Swiss francs because of exchange rate losses.    The legislators said the bank lost about 3.8 billion U.S.Dlrs between September 1985 and September 1986 as the Taiwandollar rose to 36.77 to the U.S. Dollar from 40.45.    They said they expected the losses to continue because ofthe rising Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency.    Chang said the central bank could not sell the U.S. Dollarslike other private banks or enterprises because such tradingwould be speculative and risky.    "The U.S. Dollar is an international currency and is widelyused among trading nations," he added.    Chang said the Central Bank has further revised foreignexchange rules, which would relax most controls or even suspendthem.    The revised rules have been submitted to the cabinet forapproval, he said. He declined to give details. REUTER&#3;
