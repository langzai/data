Former Treasury official C. FredBergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replacethe fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said hadnot worked.    "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the majorcountries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which theywould pledge to hold their exchange rates by directintervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary andother policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institutefor International Economics, said in a statement to a HouseBanking subcommittee.    "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that hasoccurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and shouldproduce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit thisyear and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," hesaid.
