Prime Minister Bob Hawke has decidedagainst an early election despite a leadership crisis in theopposition coalition, Australian government officials said.    They said Hawke made the decision after meeting senioradvisers and high-ranking members of the ruling Labour Party inCanberra last night.    An expected improvement in the economy predicted by anOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reportwas a major factor in Hawke's deciding against calling anelection now, they said.    The officials picked March 5 next year as the most likelyelection date, which would allow the government to complete itsfull five-year term of office and ensure that Hawke becomes thelongest-serving Labour Prime Minister in Australian history.    Hawke, however, has not withdrawn his earlier threat toconsider dissolving both houses of parliament if the oppositionNational-Liberal Party coalition blocked legislation tointroduce identity cards for Australians.
