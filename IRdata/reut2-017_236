The Bundesbank urged the West Germangovernment not to relax efforts to rein in spending when taxesare cut in a 1990 fiscal reform package, saying that higherexpenditure could lead to a dangerous rise in interest rates.    The Bundesbank's 1986 annual report said the government'schoice of measures to compensate for any cut in tax income wasa key political task. "There will also be consequences for thestate's attitude on spending," it said.    It added that, while tax cuts should have a stimulatoryeffect on the economy, the government should not expect anysignificant increase in tax income in the short-term.    The reform will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, ofwhich 19 billion marks will be financed through as yetunspecified measures.    The Bundesbank noted that reducing tax preferences andfinancial grants as well as raising some indirect taxes werebeing considered.    "As experience shows that a tax cut is not self-financing... The question remains of how the rest of the tax cuts willbe financed," the Bundesbank said.    The Bundesbank noted that in 1986, spending had increasedby more than the three pct annual average rise for 1982 to1986. If this three pct limit were exceeded over a long period,there would be a danger that increased new borrowing would benecessary to finance deficits.    It added that interest rates in West Germany were now low,partly because of a high influx of foreign funds. But thesituation would become more difficult if the government'scredit requirements increased massively. "The anticipatedstimulatory effects on the economy from the tax cuts could bethrown into jeopardy by higher interest rates," it said. REUTER&#3;
