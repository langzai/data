U.S. corn sales to Tunisia, Moroccoand other North African countries may face increasedcompetition from European Community (EC) corn sales, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its World Production and Trade report, the USDA saidsales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmedwith an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne, bringingthe French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne, FOB.    While this is about the same price as U.S. corn, EC cornhas lower transport costs, the department noted.    The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC cornexports which could reach 750,000 tonnes to North Africa andthe Middle East, areas which have traditionally purchased theircorn needs from the United States, the department said.    Department officials said the 750,000 tonnes of exports arefor the year up to September 30 1987.    They said export licenses for about 500,000 tonnes havebeen issued so far. Reuter&#3;
