All claims to be settled under aU.K./Soviet pact agreed last year in connection withpre-revolutionary Russian bonds and seized assets will betreated equally, Price Waterhouse and Co (PW) said.    It said that the treatment for the bonds had not actuallybeen determined, although it had been estimated that holderswould receive about 10 pct of the nominal value of the bonds,which was the percentage to be assigned to property claims.Now, "the face value of the bond will be added to the value ofthe property. A dividend will then be calculated and all claimswill be treated equally," PW said.    PW administers the Russian Compensation Fund, which was setup by the Foreign Office in 1917 to oversee some 45 mln stg inpre-revolutionary reserves for claimants of assets seizedduring the Revolution.    PW, which is currently accepting applications for theclaims, said that to date, 2,000 bond application forms and 600property application forms have been returned.    Because the number of applications and bonds returned isincreasing rapidly, a special office where the claims are beingprocessed will remain open beyond the close of business untilmidnight on March 31, the deadline for claims to be submitted.
