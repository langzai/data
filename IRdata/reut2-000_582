Chrysler Corp &lt;C> will begin exportingvehicles before the end of this year to Europe, the world'ssecond largest market, which it left in 1978.    Robert Lutz, executive vice president, told a newsbriefing: "After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is aboutto re-enter the European market. And we are here to stay."    Michael Hammes, vice president of international operations,said Chrysler planned to market "a few hundred vehicles" by yearend. "By the end of 1988, we hope to reach 5,000." The first carswould be sold in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland, hesaid.    The European base would be in West Germany, but no finaldecision had been made on other sites.    The company will not set up its own dealer franchises, butintends to work through distributors who will wholesale thevehicles to a franchised dealer organisation.    Lutz commented, "We prefer to export to Europe rather thanmanufacture here because it will allow us to take fullcompetitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due tothe declining value of the dollar."    The vehicles, on show at this week's Geneva motor show,include Chrysler LeBaron Turbo coupe and convertible, the DodgeLancer ES four-door hatchback, the Dodge Shadow ES compact, thePlymouth Voyager miniwagon and the Dodge Daytona Shelby Z.    Chrysler is aiming for the mainstream European buyer, whoappreciates sporty cars with 2.2 litre engines, officials said.    Prior to negotiating a loan guarantee program with the U.S.Government in 1978, Chrysler sold its European operations toPeugeot SA &lt;PEUP.P>. Chrysler now owns 24 pct of MitsubishiMotors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> and 15 pct of &lt;Maserati>, which may serveas European distribution channels in future, Hammes said. Reuter&#3;
