A new convoy of tankers escorted byAmerican warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towardsIranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having beingblasted by U.S. Navy raiders.    Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering wellclear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontlineemirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.    "I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared thisconflict will escalate," a top West German Foreign Ministryofficial, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after atour of three Gulf states.b    Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six seacaptains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying theGulf.    Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulfwould stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.Action.    But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tatassaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in thearea.    Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.    For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday thatit was ready for any further hostile action.    Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guidedmissile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flyingthe U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrierOcean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.
