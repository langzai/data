The Supreme Court left intact aruling that vacated a judgment ordering China to pay 41.3 mlndlrs for allegedly defaulting on a 1911 loan to financeconstruction of a railroad from Peking to Canton.    The Imperial Government of China issued bonds in 1911 tohelp construct a section of the so-called Hukuang railroad inan agreement with British, German, French and American banks.    According to court documents, payments on the loan weremade until the mid-1930s, when China was torn by civil war. Thepresent government, which came to power in 1949, has neveracknowledged the debt.     Nine U.S. bondholders sued China for repayment of the loanin 1979, less than a year after the normalization of relationsbetween Washington and Peking.    A U.S. District Court in Alabama in 1982 issued a judgmentthat the bondholders were entitled to all unpaid interest andprincipal on the bonds, totaling 41.3 mln dlrs.    But a U.S. Court of Appeals last July vacated the award,ruling that the Chinese government was entitled to sovereignimmunity, and dismissed the lawsuit.    Supported by the Reagan administration, China argued thatit could not be held liable for a debts involving bonds issuedin 1911 and that it enjoyed absolute immunity.    The Supreme Court, without comment, declined to hear anappeal by the bondholders seeking to reinstate their lawsuit. Reuter&#3;
