An error interrupted testing of an Arianerocket third stage starter motor on Monday but there should belittle or no delay in the launch program, Arianespace said.    A joint statement from the European Arianespace consortiumand the motor manufacturer Societe Europeenne de Propulsion(SEP) said that to avoid any risk, the motor had beendismantled and could not be used in the next launch.    It had immediately been replaced by another motor and newtests had begun today.    "In these conditions, the flight V19 remains scheduledbefore the end of June," the statement said.    Ariane launches have been suspended since an ignitionfailure in the third stage motor last May forced controllers toblow up a rocket in flight.    SEP has been carrying out a series of nearly 50simulated-altitude tests on the redesigned starter at itstightly guarded plant in the town of Vernon, 80 km northwest ofParis.    The Arianespace-SEP statement said that during a test onMarch 23, a fault in the preparation of the altitude simulationchamber meant a component of the motor came under abnormalpressure.    Arianespace originally hoped to resume launches by Februarythis year, but a longer-than-expected test program on the newstarter motor forced postponement of the next launch.    The total orderbook of outstanding launches for the13-member European Space Agency's Ariane rockets runs to morethan 40 satellites and is worth more than two billion dlrs.    The Ariane program is the main rival to the United States'NASA agency in the lucrative satellite launch market. Itsorders have sharply increased largely as a result of the U.S.Space shuttle disaster in January 1986. REUTER&#3;
