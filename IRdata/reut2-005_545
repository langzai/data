Kan'an said the loans were for Jordan's own nine billiondlr 1986-1990 development plan and not for the parallel,controversial 1.3 billion dlr plan for the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank and the Gaza strip.    He said jordan would concentrate on obtaining concessionaryforeign loans and keep commercial borrowings to a minimum.
