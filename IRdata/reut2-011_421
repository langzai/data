Treasury Secretary James Baker andOffice of Management and Budget chief James Miller defended anadministration plan to sell the U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserves.    In response to hostile questioning from a member of theHouse Appropriations Committee, the officials said the plan wasjustified to help bring the fiscal 1988 budget deficit and toget the government out of the oil business.    Miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at 3.3billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about 2.2billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale ofoil from the reserves.    Miller said the sale price may end up higher.    "We'd sell it to the highest bidder," Miller said.    "If we can get more we'll take it." Reuter&#3;
