Navistar International Corp expects itsfiscal 1987 capital spending to rise to 100 mln dlrs, up from74 mln dlrs a year ago, Chairman-elect James Cotting toldreporters after the annual meeting.    Cotting said much of the spending will go towardmodernization of the company''s painting operations at itsSpringfield, Ohio truck assembly plant. The balance will beused to increase productivity at its various facilities.    In answer to a question, Neil Springer, who on April 1becomes chairman of the company's new truck and engine holdingcompany, Navistar International Transportation Corp, said thecompany's goal is to reduce costs 25 pct by 1990.    Noting that purchased material now accounts for 81 pct ofits cost of production, Springer said Navistar intends to entersimilar relationships to one it has with Dana Corp &lt;CDN>, inwhich the two companies are coordinating design, manufacture,distribution and service of components to cut costs.    Springer said because of overcapacity in some sectors,price discounting will continue to plague the truckmanufacturing industry.    He said the heavy truck industry is operating at 65 pct ofcapacity, up 10 pct from a year ago with medium truck operatingat 73 pct of capacity, about level with a year ago.    Springer said Navistar itself is operating at "over 70 pctof capacity" in heavy trucks and at more than 90 pct in mediumtrucks.    Asked when Navistar would begin making acquisitions,Springer said "We're ready now, but we have no specifictimetable."    Earlier, at the annual meeting, stockholders gave astanding ovation to retiring Chairman Donald Lennox, who duringan eight-year tenure was cited for redirecting the companytoward profitability. Lennox told reporters he was assumingchairmanship of privately held Schlegel Corp, Rochester, N.Y.He said he hoped to take the 100-year-old manufacturer with 300mln dlrs in sales public within two years.
