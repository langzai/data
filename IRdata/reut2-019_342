Reed International Plc &lt;REED.L> deniedrumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of atakeover bid and said it had received no approach.    "In view of the increase in our share price today, I want tomake clear that we have not received any bid approaches," Reed'schairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.    Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc&lt;HBJ> might bid for Reed, a paper and printing company, pushedReed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they easedback to 564p at the close against a background of a widespreaddecline in U.K. Equity prices.    Share market analysts said speculators were buying thestock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effortto escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from RobertMaxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp &lt;BPCL.L>.    Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC totake it over, analysts added.    They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC'sbid for Harcourt was unsuccessful, it could turn its attentionto Reed. Reuter&#3;
