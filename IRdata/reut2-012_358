Manufacturers Hanover Corp said itplaced 1.4 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans toBrazilian borrowers on non-accrual as of yesterday, meaningthat income will be recorded only when actual cash payments arereceived.    As a result, net income for the first quarter will bereduced by 18 mln dlrs.    If Brazil, which suspended interest payments on its termdebt on February 20, continues to defer interest payments forthe rest of the year, net income for the whole of 1987 would bereduced by a total of 72 mln dlrs.    U.S. bank accounting guidelines do not require loans to beplaced on nonaccrual unless interest payments are past due 90days or more.  However, Manufacturers Hanover said that, inlight of current circumstances, it was more appropriate torecord income on its Brazilian loans only when cash paymentswere received.    It added that it believes Brazil will reach agreement withits banks on a debt restructuring and that all interestpayments will be received later in 1987.    The company earned 102.1 mln dlrs in first-quarter 1986 and410.7 mln dlrs for the whole of the year. Reuter&#3;
