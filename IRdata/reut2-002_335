Federal Reserve Board Vice ChairmanManuel Johnson said he does not see increasing pressure oninterest rates but said the Fed would watch out fordevelopments that could push them higher.    Johnson said that it was too early to tell if recentindicators on the economy contradicted Fed expectations ofcontinued modest growth.    "We are not anticipating any problems or see increasedinterest rate pressures," Johnson told reporters after a speechto the Eastern Economic Association.    However, Johnson said the Fed would be alert to anexcessive depreciation in the dollar, a rise in bond yields,increases in commodity prices, or other variables.    "We would have to pay attention," he said.    Recent indicators on retail sales and factory orders thatindicated weakness in the economy could be presenting aninaccurate picture, Johnson said.    The more recent data are too caught up in statisticaladjustment problems having to do with the end of the year andthe beginning of the year, he said.    Asked if the Fed was continuing to be generous withreserves, Johnson said, "We have accommodated reasonable,non-inflationary real growth."    He said the Fed was able to do that because of the declinein inflation expectations and monetary velocity.    "I don't think we can be accused of being too generous," headded. Reuter&#3;
