Indonesia's palm oil output is expectedto rise and exports to increase, the U.S. Embassy said in itsannual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector.    The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) outputis expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mlnin 1985.    The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from aprovisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes.    A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mlntonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.    "More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production willbe between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes," the report said.    The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO exporttax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higherinternational palm oil prices should lead to a modest increasein exports this year.    Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report added. REUTER&#3;
