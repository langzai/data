The Belgian government's new 150billion franc, eight pct loan has been priced at par, a FinanceMinistry spokesman said.     The eight-year loan features a call option after fouryears at 102, falling to 101-1/2 after five years and by half apoint each year thereafter.    The conditions are the same as those on the most recentpublic authority loan stock issue, for the state road buildingfund Fonds des Routes.    Some 120 billion francs of the loan will be taken up bymembers of the issuing consortium, comprising major commercialbanks, and the remaining 30 billion by publicly-owned creditinstitutions.
