Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>,VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks perordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because ofa suspected foreign currency fraud.    A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrowto discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.    VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reachtheir 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mlnmarks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtuallythe same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.    When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 itsaid the management board would propose an unchanged 10-markdividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks wouldbe proposed for the company's new preference shares.
