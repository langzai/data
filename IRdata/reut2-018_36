A plea for extra cash to bail theEuropean Community (EC) out of its latest financial crisis waslikely to be rejected at a meeting today of EC budgetministers, diplomats said.    The ministers were meeting for the first time since the ECExecutive Commission unveiled an emergency budget for 1987aimed at plugging a deficit caused by soaring farm spending andfalling revenues.    The emergency package includes a demand for member statesto pay an extra 1.5 billion European currency units (Ecus) tohelp meet the deficit.    Officials said Britain and West Germany were expected tolead opposition to contributing any extra cash, with the U.Kinsisting instead on a clampdown on runaway farm spending.    The Commission says there will be a shortfall of at leastfive billion Ecus this year, more than 1/8 of total spending.    It hopes to make up much of the shortfall in a one-timeaccounting exercise by paying member states in arrears ratherthan in advance for their spending on Community farm policies.    But if member states do not make up the rest of the gap,the Commission has warned that spending on regional and socialprojects could be slashed by half. Reuter&#3;
