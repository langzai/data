Uncertainty is growing about the prospectsfor the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scaleback investment plans, the German Savings Banks and GiroAssociation said.    Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, whileindustry is less optimistic than it was, the association saidin a report.    However, last month's agreement among the six leadingwestern industrialized countries to keep currencies aroundpresent levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence forexporters, it added.    The banking association said the possibility of usingmonetary policy to stimulate the economy should not beoverestimated.    Another small drop in already low interest rates could notbe expected to cause any significant rise in purchases ofconsumer or capital goods, it said.    The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount andLombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope forany further monetary moves, the association added.    On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said grossnational product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendaradjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with thethird quarter.
