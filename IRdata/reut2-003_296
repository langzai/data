Carolin Mines Ltdsaid recent assays of tailings at its Hope, British Columbiamine indicated that ounces of gold per ton ranged from 0.64 to0.50.    There were only trace amounts of platinum and palladium,the company said.    Carolin said the results sharply disagreed with an earlierassay performed by Intergold U.S.A. Inc which showed one ounceof gold per ton and 1/2 ounce of platinum per ton.    Carolin also said it expects to receive results of furthertests and assays of the tailings within two to three weeks.
