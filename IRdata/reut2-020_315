Britain's highest court has decided theInternational Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITCdocuments in court actions.    On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to whatextent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissibleas court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle leftfrom the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said thishearing is likely to last a few days.    On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstandingITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set ofhearings could begin in early January, they added.    The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents willbe referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companiesagainst the London Metal Exchange although the underlying caseis not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.    The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokersand cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the membergovernments of the tin council.    Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of theITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered bythe Court of Appeal legal schedule. Reuter&#3;
