Harper and Row Publishers Inc said itsboard of directors decided to take no action on two takeoverbids that the company has received. Instead, it appointed acommittee of independent directors to study strategicalternatives for the 170-year-old firm.    The alternatives include continuation of the company'sexisting business plans, possible business combinations, salesof stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of thecompany.    Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise onthe alternatives, Harper and Row added.    Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs ashare for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs ashare from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace JovanovichInc &lt;HBJ>.    After carefully considering the two offers at a meeting onFriday, the Harpers and Row board decided not to act on them.    The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire topreserve the company's independence and take advantage of its"considerable future prospects," according to director WinthropKnowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newlyestablished independent committee.    "However, given the significant current interest in thecompany, we also feel that we should carefully review all theoptions available. The committee will consider all thepertinent facts and alternatives... We intend to make a carefuland informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to aconclusion," Knowlton said.    Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board haspostponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders thathad been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal torecapitalize the company's stock in order to create two classesof shares with different votinmg rights.
