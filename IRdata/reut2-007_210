Mining companies may have todevelop specialty metals and metal-containing products ifplastics and other substitutes are not to make further inroadsin their markets, according to the United Nations.    In a report by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar onworld mineral resources, U.N. experts termed conditions in thenon-fuel mineral industry "unlike anything that has beenexperienced for the last half century."    Effects of slower global economic growth were compounded bydiminishing use of the major and base metals and thedevelopment of substitutes in traditional markets, it said.    The report was prepared for a nine-day session next monthof the U.N. committee on natural resources, an organ of theEconomic and Social Council.    The gap between world productive capacity and demand wouldeventually be eliminated by closing mines, the reportpredicted.    "Although for the most part mining companies have been slowto develop specialty metals and metal-containing products andto develop markets for such products, it seems that suchactivities will be needed if plastics and other metalsubstitutes are not to make further inroads into thetraditional markets for the major and base metals," the expertssaid.    "Integration of metal-producing and manufacturingenterprises between and among developed economies seems to be alikely consequence."    The report noted that, because of low prices, there waslittle incentive for new investment in mining except in thecase of gold, which continued to attract investment at currentprices with important increases in production in the past twoyears in North America, Australia, Papua New Guinea and LatinAmerica.
