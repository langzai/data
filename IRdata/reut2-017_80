China's textile exports in the firstquarter reached a record 2.2 billion dlrs, an increase of 49pct on the year-earlier period, the People's Daily said.    Its overseas edition gave no country breakdown. The U.S. Isone of China's largest markets for textiles.    U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige told a pressconference that Chinese textile and apparel exports to the U.S.In 1986 rose 65 pct in value from the 1985 level, a rate ofgrowth that "is not sustainable nor equitable to our other majorforeign suppliers." China is now the United States' largesttextile supplier, he said.    Baldrige declined to say what would be an acceptable growthrate for Chinese textile exports. Negotiations on the nextChina-U.S. Textile agreement are due to begin in May, he said.    "There clearly has to be a limit," he said. "Our economy canonly absorb so much textiles. It is in both of our interests toreach a satisfactory conclusion. Without an agreement, we wouldhave a chaotic situation." Reuter&#3;
