A proposal by the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission, CFTC, to raise federal limits on futuresspeculative positions for certain agricultural commoditycontracts would not reverse a decline in liquidity in thosemarkets that started in 1981, two CFTC commissioners said.    Commissioners William Seale and Kalo Hineman told a HouseAgriculture subcommittee a recent proposal that would have theeffect of raising deferred month speculative position limits onseveral agricultural commodity contracts would notsubstantially increase liquidity in those months.    "I seriously doubt that increasing speculative limits willcreate a great deal of liquidity in the back months," Sealetold the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Creditand Rural Development.    Analysts have attributed much of the liquidity squeeze to a1981 tax law change, which by changing the treatment ofso-called straddles limited the ability of futures commissionmerchants to roll positions forward for tax purposes.    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips said only that the commissionwould take into account Congress' recommendation that federalspeculative limits be raised.    The Chicago Board of Trade and the MidAmerica CommodityExchange have expressed concern that the CFTC plan woulddecrease spot month limits for certain of their contracts. Reuter&#3;
