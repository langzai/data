Royal Bank of Canada's &lt;RY> smallBrazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada(Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with anexpected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada,Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said.    "They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in theCanadian market because it's an untapped market," Brennan toldreporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber ofCommerce.    Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products likepaper machinery and ships to Canada.    He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilitiesfor Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following anagreement reached in January with international financialauthorities.    Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalledroughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canadareached about 700 mln dlrs.    Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase thisyear from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how muchbecause of the country's uncertain financial climate.    Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come fromincreased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the onlyCanadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although &lt;Bank ofMontreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said.    Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach anequitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy isessentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in aposition to resume debt repayments within a year.    Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil'sinterest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada. Reuter&#3;
