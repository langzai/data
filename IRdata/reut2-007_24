There is no question of stimulatingconsumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or otherreflationary policies to boost the French economy, sourcesclose to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.    Their comments followed remarks by prime minister JacquesChirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministerswere agreed on the desirability of "relaunching" the economy.    This sparked speculation the government was preparing for areflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruledout any such move.    The sources today said the government's policy remained oneof "recovery," or sound finances and greater efficiency.    They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion francrevenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisationprogram will go to providing public companies with freshcapital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go towardpaying off national debt.    Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30billion would be distributed between repayment of nationalinternal debt and public companies in similar proportions, theyadded.    The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation whenthe country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct thisyear from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice asfast as gross domestic product.    Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct thisyear from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line withearlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.    The sources said that with France's economic targets for1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, thegovernment had no intention of pushing the economy to grow atan artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.
