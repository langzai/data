The Federal Trade Commission chargedKraft Inc with false and misleading advertising by overstatingthe calcuim content of its Kraft Singles cheese product.    In an administrative complaint, the FTC charged theGlenview, Ill., food and consumer products company withclaiming that a slice of Kraft Singles American PasteurizedProcess Cheese Food (Kraft Singles) contains the same amount ofcalcium as five ounces of milk, when it does not.    The company also falsely advertised that Kraft Singlescontained more calcium than do most imitation cheese slices,the FTC charged.    The FTC complaint also charged that Kraft said it couldsubstantiate these claims when, in fact, it could not.    "Nutritional information is important to consumers, but itcan be difficult for them to verify." FTC Bureau of ConsumerProtection Director William MacLeod said in a statement. "Thatis why we seek to maintain the accuracy of nutritional claims."    The FTC, which voted 4-1 in favor of issuing the complaint,generally takes such action when it has reason to believe thatthe law has been or is being violated and where it apears tothe commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.    The filing of an administrative complaint marks thebeginning of a proceeding that often takes up to a year inwhich the allegations will be ruled upon after a formalhearing.    If the commission's allegations are upheld, Kraft could beprohibited from misrepresenting the calcium or other nutrientcontent of its cheese-type products, including those made incomparative ads.    The company could also be prohibited from making suchclaims without having competent and reliable scientificevidence. Reuter&#3;
