The National Pork Board announced at theAmerican Pork Congress convention in Indianapolis that refundsunder the legislative checkoff program are running less thanexpected.    The Board oversees collection and distribution of fundsfrom the checkoff program that was mandated by the 1985 farmbill. Virgil Rosendale, a pork producer from Illinois andchairman of the National Pork Board, said over 2.2 mln dlrs wascollected in January and refunds are running almost nine pct,considerably less than expected.    "We believe that this indicates good producer support forthe new checkoff. We're getting good compliance from markets,from packers and from dealers," Rosendale said. Reuter&#3;
