Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has agreedto take over the outstanding 25 pct in &lt;Deutsche Bank (Asia)AG>, the former &lt;European Asian Bank AG>, fromCreditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI>, Deutsche management boardjoint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.    Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding fromDeutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal withCreditanstalt.    Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover ofLloyds Bank plc &lt;LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.    Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recentcapital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had noplans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.    &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct wasacquired from Bankamerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> late last year, would beconsolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion ofDeutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.Wilhelm Christians said.    Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal HighCourt, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in thebalance sheet section "participations," Christians said.    But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in thesenon-bank companies as an investment rather than an activeparticipation.    Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marksin 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a riseto 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.    Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balancesheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off ina separate holding company. Reuter&#3;
