Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financialofficials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchangecontrols and study the possibility of suspending the controls,a cabinet statement said.    The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy andCentral Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduceTaiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached arecord 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month.    Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministryand the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to easethe controls, but he did not give details.    Yu said the government could maintain the framework of theforeign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. Thecontrols would be used during emergency.    Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its tradesurplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billionin 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's tradewith the United States, according to official figures.    But he said that while easing the controls would helpreduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in ashort time.    Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted fromgrowing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largesttrading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports.    Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, toldReuters: "The decision came a little bit late. But it was betterthan never."    Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, saidthe government should rapidly relax its foreign exchangecontrols and open its market wider to help balance trade withits trading partners, especially the United States.    "The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchangecontrols will not only help our trading partners, but also helpour own economic problems," he said.    He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boostTaiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February. REUTER&#3;
