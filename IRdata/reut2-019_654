U.S. car production is scheduled to dropby 10.4 pct to about 1.47 mln in the third quarter from lastyear's 1.63 mln as domestic automakers react to a drop in salesfrom last year's record levels, a trade paper said.    Automotive News said General Motors Corp has slashed itsplanned car output by 12.6 pct from last year's third quartertotals, while Ford Motor Co is scheduling its plants to build5.4 pct fewer cars and Chrysler Corp will be off 18.4 pct.    However, the paper quoted analysts as saying productionshould be cut by at least 200,000 more units to avoid excessiveinventory build-up amid weak demand for new cars.    Analysts said GM and Ford may be working to stockpile carsdespite the market conditions because of the prospect of astrike in September by the United Automobile Workers union.    Through June 20, sales of new domestic-built cars are off11.9 pct from last year's levels. Only Ford among the DetroitBig Three is enjoying a sales gain. Reuter&#3;
