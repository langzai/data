The Bank of Spain raised overnight callmoney rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetasin today's auction, which a bank spokesman termed "heavy."    Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and havebeen increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds,the spokesman said.    He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could risefurther if money supply growth rose above this year's eight pcttarget for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands.    Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct lastmonth against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.    A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applyinga more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.    The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.    "Money supply control is the government's chief weaponagainst inflation," he said. "The problem is higher rates areattracting liquidity from abroad."    He said this was why the central bank enacted specificmeasures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank ofSpain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirementon new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curbshort-term speculative capital from abroad. REUTER&#3;
