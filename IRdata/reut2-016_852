The former chief executive officerof Baldwin-United Corp, now known as PHLCorp &lt;PHX>, agreed tosettle charges stemming from misleading financial statementsthe company is accused of making before it collapsed in 1983.    Under the settlement with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, former Baldwin-United President Morley Thompsonagreed to an order issued by the U.S. District Court inCincinnati, Ohio, barring him from committing furthersecurities law violations.    Thompson did not admit or deny the charges.    Although Thompson was the last of several defendants tosettle charges brought by the SEC on September 26, 1985 inconnection with the Baldwin-United case, the agency said it iscontinuing to investigate other matters related to the companyand may bring charges against other people.    Baldwin-United, a Cincinnati-based diversified financialservices holding company, went bankrupt in September 1983. Itchanged its name last November to PHLCorp.    The SEC said Thompson violated reporting and anti-fraudprovisions of federal securities laws in late 1982 by issuingmisleading press releases.    Baldwin-United, which has already settled SEC chargesbrought against it, made "false statements concerning thefinancing for two corporate acquisitions," the SEC said.    The statements indicated that the company had availablecash for the takeovers while it was actually facing a "seriouscash flow crisis," it said.    The company was also accused of filing false and misleadingfinancial statements with the SEC. Reuter&#3;
