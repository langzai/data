Philippine coconut oil exports to Europewould be virtually wiped out if the European Community (EC)implements a new tax on vegetable oils, Philippine CoconutAuthority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said.    But he told reporters he did not think the EC would imposethe tax because of objections from the U.S.    "There's just so much flak coming from many countries,spearheaded by the United States, whose soybean exports wouldbe adversely affected. This would spark a trade war," he said.    The tax, to be imposed from July, would add about 375 dlrsa tonne to vegetable oils entering the EC.    The Philippines exported 43,540 tonnes of coconut oil worth11.7 mln dlrs to Europe in January, against total exports of86,959 tonnes worth 23.8 mln. It also exports copra and coprameal.    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez has also raisedobjections to the proposed EC tax.    He said it could cause the collapse of world demand andprices and destroy the domestic industry. REUTER&#3;
