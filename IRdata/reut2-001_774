U.S. purchases of Soviet products mustincrease before the Soviet Union will buy more U.S. goods, aSoviet trade official told Reuters.    "American exports (to the Soviet Union) depend on Sovietexports to the United States," said Albert Melknikov, deputytrade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.    "One should not forget that it is impossible only to buyfrom the United States. We must be able to sell our products tothe United States as well," he said in an interview.    The Soviet trade deficit with the United States totalledaround two billion dlrs in 1985, Melnikov said. Reuter&#3;
