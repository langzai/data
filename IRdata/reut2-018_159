Nearby months in soybean and soymealfutures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply oflivestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep thenew crop outlook bearish, traders said.    "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worriedabout where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers forthe few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with aDecatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bidanother two cents today to 10 over July futures.    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willingto sell, dealers said.    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the beliefthat even if futures rally back to last month's highs, countrymovement may remain light because farmers in many areas aresold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern halfof the Midwest.    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtimefor maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducingthe weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping thespot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help Julysoybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal hasalready moved to a premium over the August through Octobermonths and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may alsomove to a July premium later this month, they added. Reuter&#3;
