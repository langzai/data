Britain's centrist Alliance has gainedfurther ground and now stands second to the rulingConservatives according to a new public opinion poll, leavingthe main opposition Labour Party trailing in third place.    The Gallup survey to be published in tomorrow's DailyTelegraph newspaper shows the Conservatives with a popularityrating of 37.5 pct, followed by the Social Democrat/LiberalAlliance with 31.5 pct and Labour with 29.5 pct.    A Marplan poll published in this morning's edition of theToday newspaper gave the Conservatives 36 pct against a tiedfigure of 31 pct each for Labour and the Alliance.    Last month a Marplan poll gave the Tories 38 pct, theAlliance 21 pct and Labour 37 pct.    The latest poll findings would, if translated into anelection result, produce a hung parliament where no singleparty enjoyed an overall majority, analysts said.    That should dampen speculation of an early June election,they added. Reuter&#3;
