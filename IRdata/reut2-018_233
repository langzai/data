President Reagan called for continuednondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the UnitedStates in the face of congressional opposition because of theBucharest government's record on human rights.    A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press forcontinuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status forRomania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "alloptions were seriously considered."    But the statement said that despite concerns about humanrights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president haddecided that should be continued because it helped stimulateemigration from Romania and gave the United States influence onhuman rights practices there.    The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congressrequests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungaryand China.    The House of Representatives has attached to a trade billlegislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pendingcertification by Reagan that the country had made progress onhuman rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFNfor Hungary and China. Reuter&#3;
