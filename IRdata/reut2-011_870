Senate Agriculture CommitteeChairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) charged Japan with lying andcheating in its trade practices.     "The Japanese, not to put too fine a point on it, havelied, cheated and otherwise misused tariff legislation, theirsand ours. And that's to give them the benefit of the doubt,"Leahy said.     The senator's remarks to the National Cattlemen'sAssociation provoked laughter, followed by applause.     Leahy said the Reagan administration's plan to raisetariffs on a variety of Japanese imports in retaliation againstTokyo's violation of a bilateral semiconducter pact was "longoverdue." Reuter&#3;
