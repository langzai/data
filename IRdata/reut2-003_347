The divisions manufacture and distribute Greb, HushPuppies, Kodiak, and Santana brand shoes and had revenues ofabout 69 mln dlrs last year, Warrington said. It said the saleof the shoe divisions and the previous sale of its ski bootbusinesses will result in an unspecified net gain.    Warrington said it plans to concentrate on its CanstarSports Group Inc skate and athletic footwear division, thelargest ice skate manufacturer and distributor in the Westernworld.    Warrington said it decided to rationalize the balance ofits ski businesses, which is expected to result in a divestmentloss which could outweigh the net gains on the sales of itsshoe and ski boot divisions.    Taurus said the acquisition is expected to increase itsannual sales to about 100 mln dlrs and make it Canada's largestfootwear manufacturer. Reuter&#3;
