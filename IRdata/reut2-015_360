The maximum export rebate granted atyesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy overproducer complaints that they are not obtaining the ECintervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, ECCommission sources said.    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previousweek, but the change is explained by world market conditions.    Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed toobtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over oneEcu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,the sources said.    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission hadto accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention fromoperators protesting that rebates are too low.    Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unlessthe Commission reviews its export policy, they said. REUTER&#3;
