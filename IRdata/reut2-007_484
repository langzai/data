Japanese short-term interest rates,buoyed recently by seasonal factors, are likely to fall fromthe beginning of April when the new financial year begins,money traders said.    The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trendfollowing its attempts to pressure rates to enhance itsdiscount rate cut on February 23, they said.    The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three, and beganactively injecting funds into the money market to offset raterises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand forfunds from financial institutions.    Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such asaggressive commercial bill purchases, the central bank hasfailed to remove all upward pressure, money traders said.    Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks tocompete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen hasunderpinned short-term rates, they said.    Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yenwere decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September.    This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks risingto 17,830 billion yen by the end-December, a three-foldincrease on end-December 1985 levels, bankers said.    On March 31, the money market expects to see a 2,000billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscalfunds, money traders said.    From April 1, they predict the unconditional call rate willfall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the one-monthcommercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635pct.    They predict the three-month bill discount rate to slip to3.875 pct from 4.0000 today and the three-month certificate ofdeposit rate to slide to 4.10/4.15 from 4.35/25. REUTER&#3;
