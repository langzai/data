One top official said the rate cuts would helpto stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed thatcountries other than West Germany were seen to be helpingsustain the economy.     The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not benamed, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the newmanaging director of the International Monetary Fund, on theIMF's latest assessment of the debt crisis.
