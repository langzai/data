The Department of Transportation(DOT) said it would go ahead at seven airports with acontroversial plan to reduce airline delays by enablingcompeting companies to coordinate their schedules.    Under the plan, the DOT will grant the airlines immunityfrom the antitrust laws so they can redistribute their flighttimes over the day and avoid the clustering of flights thattypically occurs at the most desirable travel times.    Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she haddecided to grant unconditional immunity to the carriers servingAtlanta's Hartsfield and Chicago's O'Hare airports.    At five other airports--Dallas-Fort Worth, Boston, Denver,Newark and Philadelphia--Dole said she would grant conditionalimmunity to enable further government study.    Under this part of the plan, the carriers serving thesefive airports have been asked to give DOT their summer 1987schedules by the end of the week.    The agency will then review the schedules and decide byMonday whether they threaten to cause delays.    If so, those airports would be added to the list of thosegranted wider immunity to enable scheduling talks.    Dole said she was confident no anticompetitive effectswould result from the talks, which she said would be monitoredby U.S. officials and would be open to the public.    Flight delays at the nation's 22 busiest airports soared in1986 to 367,000 from 295,000 in 1985. The government believesmost delays are caused by weather.    The DOT first proposed the immunity plan in late Januaryand said it might be granted for a total of 13 airports.    Dropped from the final plan were the Minneapolis-St. Paul,New York-LaGuardia, New York-J.F. Kennedy, San Francisco, St.Louis and Washington-Dulles airports. Reuter&#3;
