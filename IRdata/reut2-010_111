billion-dlr package of budget deficit reductions, half throughunspecificed new revenues, to cut the 1988 deficit with a goalof balancing the budget in 1991 under a new law's target.    The committee went over a package of deficit reductionsproposed by its chairman, Democrat Lawton Chiles of Florida,which he said would reach the 108-billion-dlr deficit in 1988under the Gramm-Rudman budget law -- using President Reagan'seconomic estimates.    Using the Congressional Budget Office estimates, whichCongress usually relies on, would produce a deficit of 134billion dlrs, Chiles said.    Under the Chiles plan, deficits would be cut fromanticipated levels by nearly 110 billion dlrs over four yearsto produce a 1991 balanced budget--the target of the GrammRudman law.    For 1988, the Chiles formula would cut the deficit by 37billion dlrs, half through defence and non defence savings,mthe rest through revenues.    Defence would be cut nearly 6.9 billion dlrs. Reaganproposed hiking outlays by some 8 billion dlrs.    His non defence budget savings, including health, welfare,agricultural, government services and reduced interestpayments, amount to 11.6 billion dlrs. Reuter&#3;
