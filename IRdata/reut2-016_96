The government must announce harsh cutsin spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to givean adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZBanking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said.    Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against thebackdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthlyBusiness Indicators publication.    "For the past two years, the government has struggled withan economic reality that demands measures beyond those which itsees as politically practicable," it said.    The political climate meant there would be a continuedover-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate andmaintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.    "The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revivalof business investment will be further postponed," it said.    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted byexport and import-replacement industries which had created afalse suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance ofpayments crisis were past. "Unfortunately, successful adjustmentto Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains along-term process," it said.    In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderateoverall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.    The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDPthis year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would growstrongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion atend-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.    Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages wereexpected, ANZ said. REUTER&#3;
