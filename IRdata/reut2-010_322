&lt;Brierley Investments Ltd> (BIL)launched a full takeover bid for the supermarket group&lt;Progressive Enterprises Ltd> at 4.35 dlrs a share.    BIL said in a statement the offer is conditional on minimumacceptances totalling 30 mln shares, just under 25 pct of the120.4 mln Progressive shares on issue.    Progressive is currently involved in a proposed merger with&lt;Rainbow Corp Ltd>. Rainbow earlier this week raised its stakein Progressive to 52 pct. BIL opposes the Rainbow merger andanalysts say BIL needs a 25 pct stake in Progressive to preventit occurring.    The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbowboth receiving shares in a new company &lt;Astral Pacific CorpLtd> on a one-for-one exchange basis.    The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it wouldoffer when it first announced on Monday it would make a fullbid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate betweenBIL and Rainbow.    BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that heopposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL seesProgressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.BIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds.    Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based. ChairmanAllan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed onlyat dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests ofProgressive shareholders.    Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved themerger proposal. It has also been approved by the CommerceCommission, but BIL's bid is still subject to the Commission'sscrutiny.    Progressive shares ended at 4.35 dlrs, Rainbow at 3.42 andBIL at 4.17 at the close of New Zealand Stock Exchange tradingtoday. REUTER&#3;
