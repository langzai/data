Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollarcould be counterproductive for world economic growth.    Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volckersaid that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growthin those countries was also decreasing.    "In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciationof the dollar could well be counterproductive," he said.    Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has notbeen enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volckersaid.    On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not saywhether it should be higher or lower to restore balance intrade.    "What we do know is that a substantial exchange rateadjustment has already been made," he said.    "That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of agrowing world economy and fiscal restraint in the UnitedStates, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowingin the real trade deficit in the period ahead," he said.    Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantiallywhile import growth should slow.    Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with aminimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would haveto slow its spending growth.    It would also have to achieve a better balance betweeninvestment and domestic savings if it wants to be able todispense with foreign capital.    "The constructive way to work in the needed direction wouldbe to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the wayfor improvements in our trade accounts," he said.    Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would riskrenewed inflation, he said. Reuter&#3;
