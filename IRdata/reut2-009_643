Revisions to the by-laws of theStock Exchange of Singapore to be introduced on April 1 willhave little impact on the market, brokers and analysts said.    One analyst did say, however, that the removal of fixedcommissions on transactions in government securities and Asiancurrency bonds would increase trading volume, because mostdeals before were transacted directly between clients.    One change will allow stockbroking firms to advertise, butbrokers said this would not have much effect because mostcorporate clients already know the market well.    Many remisiers (brokers' agents) and dealers criticised theexchange for not taking the opportunity to abolish or cuttransfer fees on remisiers moving to other firms.    One remisier said the transfer fees inhibit an efficientbroking system because they restrict brokers' movements.    But most remisiers welcomed the amendment to replace cashdeposits with bank guarantees for business transactions. Wherean extra deposit is needed, it can in future be either in cashor in securities approved by the exchange.    Other remisiers felt the new rule that they must report alltransactions involving 50,000 dlrs or more to the exchange wasunnecessary.    Another revision says broking firms are not allowed toimprove a buying and selling quote by more than one bid duringthe last five minutes of trading. REUTER&#3;
