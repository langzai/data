Holderbank Financiere Glarus AG &lt;HOLZ.G>expects its 1987 results to be at least steady, with increasesin volume sales and negative currency factors roughlycancelling each other out, deputy chairman Max Amstutz said.    He told a news conference that turnover was likely to rise20 pct in volume terms, partly through the consolidation ofrecently acquired companies. Ideal Basic Industries Inc &lt;IDL>of the U.S., Which Holderbank agreed last year to acquire,should boost group sales by around 12 pct.    But the weakness of the dollar -- the key currency for thegroup -- would remain a strong negative factor.    Holderbank earlier reported consolidated 1986 net profit of239 mln Swiss francs compared with 126 mln in 1985 on saleswhich fell to 3.3 billion francs from 3.6 billion.    Group president Thomas Schmidheiny said Holderbank was nowin a consolidation phase after 15 years of enormous growth.    Priority would be given to strengthening its existingpositions and to integrating recent acquisitions but the groupwould continue to take advantage of new opportunities foracquisitions. Reuter&#3;
