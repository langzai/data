American Express Co, rumored to beconsidering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unitthat could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meetbroadening international competition.    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson saidthe actions under consideration are an integral part ofAmerican Express' worldwide financial services strategy andthat the two companies have been having both internal andexternal discussions on the matters.    American Express said no decision has been reached on thestrategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimatelydecide to follow growth plans already in place.    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that thefinancial services giant was considering a spinoff of part ofShearson and there was speculation it may be consideringselling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said thespeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct ofthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.    There was some speculation that American Express had alsoconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan wasconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that itwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesmanwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remainedsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove AmericanExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring itto a Friday close at 74.     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because asimilar statement was being circulated to employees.    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense forAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-ownedbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50pct in the last year.    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinningoff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stockprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.    American Express' ambitious plans for international growthmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out partof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all ofShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling."(American) Express is in a position where they can raisecapital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder ofPrudential-Bache Securities.    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization ofShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer JeffreyLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.     The reorganization also created four new positions forchairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analystsspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement doeslittle to clarify last week's market speculation. It doesconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, whichunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a majoracquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls forgrowth and positioning in the global market competition.    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts saidthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed whenit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.
