U.S. House Ways and MeansCommittee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said a tax increaseprobably would be needed but that Congress and President Reganmight not approve one.    Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, also told the FuturesIndustry Association that he did not think congressional taxwriters would approve a tax on stock transfers or ease taxes topromote U.S. Exports.    He congratulated House Speaker James Wright for proposingtax increases to help cut the budget deficit.    Rostenkowski said he hoped White House Chief of StaffHoward Baker could persuade President Reagan to support apackage of tax increases and spending cuts.    He noted that Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker bothsupported tax increases in l982.    Rostenkowski suggested that about 18 billion dlrs of newtaxes might have to be found, along with nine billion indefence and spending cuts and another nine billion in domesticspending reductions. But, he said, proposed tax rises would bebrought to the floor only if House Democratic leaders feltthere was Republican support.    A string of indictments of Wall Street figures could movesome in Congress to support a tax on stock transfers, he said.    "But the fact many people don't like what's happening infinancial markets doesn't mean they will be hit with a tax," hesaid, noting that Wright's securities tax idea had not been"fleshed out."    Efforts by special interests to rewrite provisions of thetax reform bill will fall on deaf ears, Rostenkowski predicted.    The chief House tax writer also predicted congress wouldapprove legislation to reform the welfare system. REUTER&#3;
