Baker International Corp treasurer EricMattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposedmerger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or whatcompromises might be acceptable to it.    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlroilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday whenHughes management, balking at the terms of a government consentdecree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meetingcalled to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and saidit hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.    Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes didnot want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree untilafter Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations weresold.    Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger waspossible between the two giant oilfield service companies.    "The company's position is we would like to see the mergerbe completed, which is in the best interests of ourshareholders and their shareholders," Mattson said.    "Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of thelitigation, I can't go any further than that," he said.    Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterdayto force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consentdecree.    Mattson also declined to comment on whether the directorsof Baker and Hughes have scheduled any meetings to discuss themerger. Reuter&#3;
