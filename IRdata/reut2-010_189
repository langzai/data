Canamax Resources Inc and PacificTrans-Ocean Resources Ltd said they conditionally approvedstarting production at their jointly owned Ketza River golddeposit in the Yukon after a study recommended the move.    They said production was conditional on approval of a waterlicense and arrangement of appropriate financing. Theyestimated development costs for the mine and mill would total21.1 mln dlrs, including three mln dlrs of working capital.    The feasibility study anticipated gold production of 49,600ounces a year at a cost of 129 Canadian dlrs a short ton, theysaid.    Canamax and Pacific Trans-Ocean said the project wouldyield a 40 pct after-tax real rate of return at a gold price of400 U.S. dlrs an ounce.    They said they would mine 460,000 tonnes of proven andprobable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 0.45 ounce goldper ton at a yearly rate of 112,000 tonnes for a mine life of4.25 years.    Possible reserves of 75,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounce goldper ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year,with considerable potential for development of further oxideore reserves at the deposit, they said.
