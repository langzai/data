Producers, news writers, editors andtechnicians began a strike at the National Broadcasting Co(NBC), leaving management employees to do their jobs.    The strike by members of the National Association ofBroadcast Employees (NABET), representing 2,800 of NBC's 8,000workers, began at 12:01 A.M. (0401 GMT) after the networkimposed a contract which the union said was unacceptable.    The union said its main objection to the contract was thatit permitted NBC to employ additional part-time workers.    The average salary of workers represented by NABET is65,000 dlrs a year.    Union officials said management was being intransigent andblamed General Electric &lt;GE>, which purchased NBC and itsparent company RCA in 1985 in a flurry of communicationscompany takeovers.    The strike is the first for NBC since 1976.    The two sides said they have set no time to meet again. REUTER&#3;
