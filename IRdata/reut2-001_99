Continental Corp said the fresh startprovision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to1987 earnings per share.    The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mlndlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.    John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said thefresh start provision allowed the company to discount openingtax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxesinto earnings.    Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would declinegradually over the next four years, during which timeContinental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.    Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd tohave a significant impact on earnings. Reuter&#3;
