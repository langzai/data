Stockbrokers and legislators welcomedthe suspension of trading on the local market after Monday'srecord fall, but some said the suspension was too long andcould harm the territory's reputation as a financial centre.    Announcing the suspension until next Monday, stock exchangechairman Ronald Li said earlier today "This will protectinvestors and allow brokers to settle a backlog of orders."    But legislator David Li, who is also managing director ofthe Bank of East Asia, while weloming the move, said a one-dayhalt would have been enough.    "I believe the exchange is over-reacting. A long suspensionwill damage Hong Kong's reputation as a financial centre andhurt foreign investors' confidence," David Li said.    Legislator Hui Yin-fat echoed this view. "What will they doif the market resumes its fall next week ?" he asked.    Legislator Lee Yu-tai said small investors would behard-hit by the decision. He said some were paying interest onloans to purchase stock and a long suspension increased theirlosses.    Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs said the decision wasexplainable, but he added, "It does seem rather a long time."    However, George Tan, assistant director of GreenwellMontagu (Far East) Ltd, said the suspension was wise. "Hong Kongis a volatile market and this will let things settle down," hesaid.    Other brokers agreed. "At least this gives us a bit ofbreathing space," said one.    John MacKenzie, chairman of the Hong Kong Association ofBanks, said "I feel that it is not at all a bad thing thatinvestors and investment mnanagers be given a breathing space."    Hong Kong's main share indicator, the Hang Seng index, fell420.81 points to 3,362.39 on Monday - its biggest ever one-dayfall in real terms. REUTER&#3;
