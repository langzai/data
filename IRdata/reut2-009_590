Colombia plans to maintain foreignborrowing at levels similar to the 1982-86 period, during whichit received a net 1.3 billion dlrs net of repayments, FinanceMinister Cesar Gaviria said.    He told the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) annualmeeting here that despite Latin America's debt crisis, Colombiacontinues to achieve positive credit flows reflecting thestrength of its economy that grew five pct last year.    Public Credit Director Mauricio Cabrera said Colombia plansto launch a foreign bond issue in the second half of 1987,possibly for 60 mln dlrs.    Cabrera said a 50 mln dlr floating rate note (FRN) issue byColombia is expected to close next month. It carries a 1-1/8pct margin over Libor, with a seven year maturity and fouryears grace.    He also told Reuters he did not expect any increase inColombia's financing needs as a result of current fallingcoffee prices, after a surge last year doubled export incomefrom this source to around three billion dlrs.    "The drop will simply bring us back to 1985 levels, with aloss of no more than about 100 mln dlrs," he said.    Colombia, with a total foreign debt of around 13 billiondlrs, has a foreign borrowing programme of around three billiondlrs this year, of which about one billion is new credits.    Its foreign reserves ended 1986 at 3.5 billion dlrs,equivalent to more than nine months of imports andnon-financial services, and GDP growth is again expected toreach five pct this year, Gaviria said.
