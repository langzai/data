The Bank of France said in its latestmonthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup inindustrial production registered in March to gather steam overthe next few months.    Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lostearlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly toa firming of domestic demand.    "New progress is expected in all main sectors except capitalgoods where production will remain at its present level," thereport added.    The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March tradebalance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade forthe first time since June 1982.    While the automobile industry remained unchanged frompreviously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew andwas expected to accelerate except in the area of domesticappliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in allsectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a risein public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in allsectors continued to slow. REUTER&#3;
