Japan has agreed to help the United Statesstrengthen anti-submarine defences after illegalhigh-technology Japanese exports significantly damaged mutualsecurity, U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said.    Weinberger told a press conference that exports of Japanesemachines designed to make Soviet submarines quieter and harderto detect had been a serious blow. But he said he wasencouraged by the punishment dealt to Toshiba Machine Co, asubsidiary of Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>, for the illegal exports,and by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's assurances thataction would be taken to keep it from happening again.    The government has barred Toshiba Machine from exporting toCommunist countries for a year and said it intends tostrengthen and expand its export control system.    Weinberger gave no details of the anti-submarine program.    In his talks with Japanese Defence Minister Yuko Kurihara,he said, he made a pitch for American companies seeking tobuild Japan's new fighter aircraft for the 1990's.    "I assured Minister Kurihara that I support his plans toincrease Japanese air defence capabilites and that I believeAmerican aircraft can do this," he said. The Japanese industryargues it should develop the fighter plane on its own. REUTER&#3;
