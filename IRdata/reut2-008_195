USAir Group Inc said it has amendedits 69 dlr per share tender offer for shares of PiedmontAviation Inc to reduce the maximum number it will accept to9,309,394. Previously it had sought all shares.    In a newspaper advertisement, USAir said the offer andwithdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expireApril 3, along with the new proration period.    On Friday, the U.S. Department of Transportation approvedUSAir's acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont. If USAir were toacquire more than 51 pct in the tender, it would be required tosell the excess within one week.    USAir said receipt of the 9,309,394 shares -- which is alsothe minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total ofabout 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50.1pct on a fully diluted basis.    The company said even if the purchase of the 9,309,394Piedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit, USAirwould waive the condition to the offer that the TransportationDepartment approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir tobuy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir'sapplication to gain control of Piedmont, subject to the ordernot being rescinded or modified in an adverse way.
