Firms need not be pessimistic about exportprospects even though foreign markets have become moredifficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministrysaid.     The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georgvon Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports couldstart rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing thelower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.    But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be noneed to worry about the economy as long as the weakness ofexports did not affect currently good domestic demand.    Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good butnoted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. "Thisis certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not forstimulative steps," he said.    The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to workactively to promote free world trade, he added.    Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good exportopportunities. Price alone was not the only factor ininternational competitiveness, he said, adding German firmshave a reputation for high quality standards, prompt deliverytimes and good service.    Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficultposition on its trade figures.  It faced international pressureto reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worriedabout the effect of the mark's strength on the country'sexporters.    Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to arecord 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise wasdue entirely to the lower value of imports caused by thedecline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports havein fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.
