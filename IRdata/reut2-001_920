Bethlehem Steel Corp hasinvestigated the ramifications of a filing for reorganizationunder Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws but has nopresent plans to file, a company spokesman told Reuters.    The spokesman said the investigation was made some time agoand was undertaken as a precaution in the interest of prudentmanagement.    He said while Bethlehem, which has been losing money forseveral years, does not intend to seek protection fromcreditors now, it could do so if conditions worsened,particularly if it ran out of cash.    But the spokesman said Bethlehem ended 1986 with over 460mln dlrs in cash on hand, partly due to the sale of assets overthe year, and expects to maintain its cash position at aroundthat level through 1987.    At the end of 1985, Bethlehem had less than 100 mln dlrs incash. Reuter&#3;
