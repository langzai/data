Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> will increase productionabroad to overcome falling profits caused by the yen's riseagainst the dollar, managing board chairman Akio Morita toldthe West German newspaper Die Welt.    He was quoted as saying that Sony, whose latest profitfigures had been affected strongly by dollar fluctuations,would increase production in the U.S. And Europe.    Several production facilities were being built, he added."At the same time we are also investing capital in order tomodernise our locations and raise our productivity."    Morita said that to overcome the same currency problems,Japan needs to restructure its economy in order to live lessfrom exports and more from domestic demand.    He said U.S. And European companies had made the mistake ofnot investing enough in the future, which was why they had losttheir lead in consumer electronics.    "They may spend a lot of money on research and development,"he said. "But planning and marketing are very important sectorsin developing a marketable product."    "If they don't spend money on these, they can't build up newbusiness lines."    Speaking of difficulties foreign firms experience inpenetrating the Japanese market, Morita said "Naturally, I haveto admit that there are still many obstacles in Japan."    On the other hand, many foreign firms were too interestedin short-term success, he said.    "If, therefore, a company comes to Japan and wants to make aprofit at once on this market, it is not so simple."    "These people then complain, while the successful firms keeptheir mouths shut," Morita said. Reuter&#3;
