The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration toprovide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does notplace any restrictions on its actions.    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirdsof those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an allianceof liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought todefeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislatorsoppose President Reagan's policies in the region.    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --effectively making them American ships.    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic andRepublican leadership as well as by the administration --required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide areport to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans toprotect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.    It did not, however, place any restrictions on theadministration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships andthus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation thisweek. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only afirst step toward a greater congressional involvement informulating policy.    But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask theadministration to address tough policy questions in the report. Reuter&#3;
