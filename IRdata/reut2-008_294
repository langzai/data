Bayerische Vereinsbank AG &lt;BVMG.F>expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's recordlevels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.    He told the annual news conference that possible creditrisks, especially those associated with foreign nations, hadlargely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were thereforeunlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.    Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profitincreased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.    Hackl said that interest margins in the banking businesshad declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previousyear. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increasedslightly and stood around 0.7 pct.    Parent bank commission surplus in the securities businesshad risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.    Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mlnmarks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.    The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, whichexcludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbedtwo pct to 671 mln marks.    The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.    It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgagebusiness and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.    The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank businessvolume rose to 46 pct from 45.    Hackl said that in January and February this year, thebank's credit business had not livened up. But despite thesharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on ownaccount had increased in the first two 1987 months comparedwith the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.
