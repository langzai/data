Comalco Ltd said its return to profitreflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices andits withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for theyear ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 wasalso aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt andgreater sales of bauxite and aluminium.    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents pershare final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage ofproposed dividend imputation laws.    This would make five cents for the year against a first andfinal of one cent in 1985.    Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to sufferfrom low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australiandollar had helped earnings.    Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier ithas conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter inWashington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to ColumbiaAluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may bereduced if the sales agreement were completed. REUTER&#3;
