Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has attackedbudget proposals made by the European Community's executiveCommission, saying they ignore efforts to cut spending, andadded that divisions over the issue would be hard to resolve atthis week's EC summit.    The Commission has proposed radical changes in the way themember countries contribute to the budget, suggesting paymentsshould be linked to economic output instead of tax revenue.    But the richer northern nations such as Britain, WestGermany and France are insisting on stricter spending controlsbefore agreeing to any reform.    "The proposals of the Commission, at the level they arebeing made, are not compatible with the efforts which each ofour nations is making to reduce spending ... Therefore there isa big problem," Chirac said in a radio interview.    EC leaders would also try to resolve a dispute on reformsof agricultural spending, largely to blame for an expected 5.7billion dlr shortfall in the EC budget this year.    Chirac said that West Germany, under pressure from itspowerful farm lobby, was alone in opposing reforms to thecommon agricultural policy, while France shared a commonposition on the issue with the 10 other EC states.
