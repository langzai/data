Morrison Knudsen Corp said itsearnings for 1987 are likely to be lower than those for 1986due to lower than expected growth in engineering andconstruction and a previously-predicted decline in earnings ofits National Steel and Shipbuilding unit.    The company earned 39.4 mln dlrs in 1986, including pretaxgains of 11.5 mln dlrs from pension income and 7,400,000 dlrsfrom the settlement of vested pension obligations, down from41.5 mln dlrs in 1985.    It said "Lower than expected levels of new work booked inthe last quarter of 1986 and the first two-plus months of thisyear have delayed the expected growth in the engineering andconstruction area."  The company said it will remain profitablein 1987 and results should strengthen as the year progresses. It attributed the decline in new work to more stringent biddingstandards and a competitive market. Reuter&#3;
