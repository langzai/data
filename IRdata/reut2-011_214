CSR Ltd has made a bold move in sellingits oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs andploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, shareanalysts said.    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gasinterests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would insteadsell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and ProductionAustralia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largestsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct itdoes not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had givenitself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on anambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisionsof sugar and building products, analysts said.    The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far thelargest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industryand access to some of the best sugar properties and mills inthe country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommendacceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from thebottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. REUTER&#3;
