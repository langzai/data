Zambia will retain its foreign-exchangeauction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions sinceJanuary 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.    "We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't beenabolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview.    He said the system would be reintroduced after currenttalks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fundand, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.    Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auctionsystem would be used to allocate foreign exchange to privatebidders but not to fix the exchange rate.    Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of thegovernment's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.    It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation andstrong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossiblefor the government and the private sector, he said.    Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. Thekwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.In January 1987 the government was more than two months inarrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, andthe auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchangerate of nine kwacha to the dollar.
