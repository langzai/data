A special meeting of the InternationalCoffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to setcoffee export quotas, ICO delegates said.    Producers and consumers could not find common ground on theissue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, oftenheated talks, delegates said.    Export quotas -- the major device of the InternationalCoffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a yearago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought inBrazil which cut its output by two thirds.    Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffeeprices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four yearlows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting. Reuter&#3;
