The Paris Club of creditor nations agreedto a major rescheduling of Uganda's and Mozambique'sgovernment-to-government debts, the Club said in a statement.    At meetings here this week, both countries were accordedterms that were more generous than usually granted by the Club.Uganda was given 15 years to repay its debts with a six-yeargrace period while Mozambique was accorded an exceptionallylong 20-year period, with 10 years' grace.    The Club said it approved of both countries' economic andfinancial programs and would therefore make a contribution toimprove their external payments prospects.    It said both countries faced heavy debt service obligationsand low per capita income, adding the solution of thecountries' debt problems would take a number of years.    The statement also said Mozambique's limited debt servicecapacity made borrowing from the International Monetary Fund inthe upper credit tranches "inappropriate."    No details were available from the countries' embassies norfrom the Club on the amounts involved, but last week theUgandan Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said he was hopingfor a rescheduling of 120 mln dlrs. Uganda's total foreign debtis estimated at some 1.5 billion dlrs.    A French Finance Ministry statement issued the same time asthe Paris Club statement, said France had formally agreed withGabon to reschedule bilateral unpaid debt amounting to about440 mln francs.    The bilateral agreement, covering payments due to have beenmade by May 31 this year, follows the Paris Club's Januarydecision to grant Gabon an extended repayment period for itsgovernment-to-government debt.    The ministry said French aid to Gabon in 1987, within theframework of the country's economic recovery program, amountsto about 1.67 billion francs. REUTER&#3;
