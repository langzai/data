Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a16.2 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, told the Securities andExchange Commission he has discussed with the company thepossibility of seeking control of it.    Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controlsAmerican Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft'smanagers and directors have been aimed at "achieving anincreased ownership position" in the company.    Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made eitherby making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part ina group to acquire the company.    Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through AmericanFinancial and its subsidiaries, said he is also consideringbuying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals.    He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led toany agreements or understandings.    But Lindner said he intends to review his investment inTaft and may be involved in further talks or take other stepsregarding the future control and direction of Taft.    Lindner's investor group recently raised its Taft stake to1,489,298 shares, or 16.2 pct from 1,439,498 shares, or 15.6pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs.    Although he recently received clearance from the FederalTrade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct,Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that hisinterest in Taft was for investment only and not was notseeking to control the company.
