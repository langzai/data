Emergency action to distributeEuropean Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has provedso successful that the EC executive Commission may propose apermanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.    Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC storesbetween January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved thescheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.    The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnesof sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, hasbeen distributed to the needy through charities.    The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure tohelp poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winterand will end on March 31.    But the spokesman said the commission will consider whetherto propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.    The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporaryscheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units(72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr)ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.    However, commission sources said the real cost was small ifaccount is taken of the expense of keeping food in store untilits quality and value deteriorates.    On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on ECfood surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks atJanuary 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnesof beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals. Reuter&#3;
