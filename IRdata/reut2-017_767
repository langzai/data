share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), analysts said.    "The offer is inadequate," said Douglas Augenthaler, ananalyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent theneeded premium over the company's fundamental value based onearnings estimates.    USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at48-1/8, down 3/8.    USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he couldnot comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the boardwould meet to consider it.    Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcementthat same day of higher earnings expectations changed itsvalue. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceedanalysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in thelow 40s, Augenthaler said.    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the wastemanagement concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on theannouncment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste managementbusiness holds significant growth potential. The industry hasgrown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based onearnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with KidderPeabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.    Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrstotal, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportationand energy company would both gain entry into a profitablebusiness and win cost-control benefits, he said.    "Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairlysignficant environmmental problems of its own," he said.    Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holdsa 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offerwas "grossly inadequate." Reuter&#3;
