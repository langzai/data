West German economic growth will slow to1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domesticdemand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in itssemi-annual review of the world economy.    This view is less favourable than the West Germangovernment's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct thisyear, but is in line with forecasts by independent economicinstitutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.    The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,with the gross national product rising by two pct in realterms.    The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passingthrough a period of temporary weakness and there would be somerecovery in business confidence in the near future.    But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economywas higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.    While noting that the government is bringing forward a fivebillion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that "themedium to longer-term performance of the West German economycould be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allowrelatively lower tax rates."    Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German FederalStatistics Office has released figures showing that the GNPactually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter ofthis year compared with the final three months of 1986.    Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appearedlikely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any ofthe Group of Seven leading industrial nations.    West Germany's current account surplus, the target ofconsiderable criticism by the Reagan administration, isexpected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in1988.
