The rebate granted at yesterday's ECsugar tender represents some concession to producers'complaints that they are losing money on exports outside thebloc, EC Commission officials said.    The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is neededto obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales intointervention.    The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilosshort of the level producers said was needed, the officialssaid.    The officials said the Commission is not negotiating withproducers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugarfor sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuadeit to offer higher rebates.    They said the French and German producers involved are nowunable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugarwill officially enter intervention stores.    Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be opento them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1and the official payment date when the Commission officiallytakes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.    The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which woulddrive down market prices further.    They expressed some hope that the operators would noteventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.    "We think they realise they have gone too far," one officialsaid. REUTER&#3;
