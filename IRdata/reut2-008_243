Rain over wide areas has raised theprospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffereda disastrous drought and famine two years ago.    Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's AgricultureDevelopment Department, told reporters prospects were good forattaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the presentgrowing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.    Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnesa year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the "belg"(small) rains which fall at this time of year.    The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops likemaize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affectsproduction in the main rainy season, because farmers eat theirstocks of seed.    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regionswhich suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sowtheir crops because of the favourable rains.    The government had distributed large quantities of seed andfertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop. Reuter&#3;
