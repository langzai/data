Venezuelan president Jaime Lusinchiapproved a general wage increase in the form of bonuses rangingfrom 20 to 30 pct and a 120-day price freeze on a basket ofbasic consumer goods.    Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved bythe cabinet. They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchiin a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees wasreleased this afternoon.    Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, sayingit will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987.    The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct.    The wage increase for public and private sector employeeswill be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. Forsalaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for thoseof 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct.    The measures were taken in response to a request from theVenezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the lossin the purchasing power of workers' salaries. It estimated theloss at 40 pct.    The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchisince his government took office in February 1984.    The wage increases are a bonus and will not be consideredin calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said.    At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offsand firings for the next 120 days.    The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and otherconsumer goods declared to be "of primary necessity."    It does not apply to prices charged by agriculturalproducers or to goods for which the price is falling.    The decree establishes fines of between 1,000 and 500,000bolivars for merchants who violate the price control measure. REUTER&#3;
