The dollar drifted down to end onepfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by thelack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting andcomments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.    Dealers said the communique early in the European morningfrom the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors andalthough the dollar dipped it generally resisted furtherattempts to push it lower through the day.    The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, belowyesterday's last 1.8365/75.    Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction wasbased on a global view, with operators paying most attention tocomments by finance officials to see how closely they statedadherence to international agreements such as those set at thePlaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.    Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7as "soft as wax."    Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters ina telephone interview that the German central bank sees nocurrent reason to change monetary course at present.    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarksyesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and WestBerlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealerssaid revived some speculation that German interest rate cutsmay be under consideration.    German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70pct after 3.80 yesterday.    Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections addedvia Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut nextweek. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocationat an unchanged 3.80 pct.    But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesingersaid, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on thistheme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."    Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankerscomments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.    Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marksper 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
