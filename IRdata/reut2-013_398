The dollar was steady near lower openinglevels in extremely quiet trading and dealers did not expectthe U.S. Currency to move significantly before the series ofhigh-level monetary meetings starting today in Washington.    Sterling trading was equally quiet.    Bullishness on the back of two new opinion polls suggestingBritain's ruling Conservative party had increased its lead overthe opposition was checked by fears of fresh sterling-sellingintervention by the Bank of England, dealers said.    The dollar fetched 1.8215/25 marks at midsession against1.8195/8205 at the opening and 1.8245/55 in Europe last night.    The dollar was quoted at 145.10/20 yen, virtually unchangedfrom its opening 145.05/15 but sharply below yesterday'sEuropean closing 146.00/10.    It briefly dipped below 145 yen, to a quoted low of 144.85,but recovered later to trade quietly around opening levels,dealers said.    Trade-weighted, sterling stood at 72.3 pct of its 1975value, unchanged form the opening but one basis point belowyesterday's close. The pound fetched 2.9480/9520 marks and1.6190/6200 dlrs at midsession after its opening 2.9540/75 and1.6213/23, and yesterday's closing 2.9490/9530 and 1.6163/73.    Dealers said dollar business had virtually halted in Europeafter a large selloff against the yen in the Far East, whichsustained Bank of Japan intervention failed to stem earliertoday.    They said that in the absence of other factors,participants awaited the outcome of the informal talks of Groupof Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washingtontoday, and Group of Seven monetary talks tomorrow.    Most dealers expected the meetings to produce little morethan a vaguely worded statement to reaffirm shared objectivesof stable currency markets and economic policy coordination.    The Group of Five and Canada agreed in Paris on February 22to call a halt to the dollar's sharp decline, and severalparticipant central banks have since intervened to keepcurrencies within narrow ranges against each other.    But a flare-up of the long-standing trade frictions betweenthe U.S. And Japan last month encouraged markets to test theagreement, pushing the dollar sharply lower against the yen.    Dealers said that short of a convincing undertaking byJapan at the Washington talks to step up efforts to reducetrade surpluses and stimulate domestic demand, the dollar wouldresume its fall, especially against the yen.    Without agreement on the trade issue, the dollar appearsset to test support levels at 143 yen in the very short term,with 140 yen within reach over the next few weeks, dealerssaid.    Some dealers said Japan appears ready to compromise withthe U.S. On economic policy issues.    Expectations were rising of a further half-point cut in theJapanese discount rate and Japan's ruling Liberal DemocraticParty today announced an outline agreement on economicreflation which includes a 5,000 billion yen additional budgetfor 1987, the dealers said.    Some dealers said the market could get some impetus fromU.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker when he testifies onThird World debt problems before the Senate banking committeelater today.    Dealers said sterling remained firm amid growing confidencethe ruling Conservative party is assured of victory in anelection which they said would likely be called for June.    One poll out today showed the Conservatives leading with 43pct support against Labour's 30 pct and the Liberal-SocialDemocratic Alliance at 26 pct. Another poll forecast aConserative majority of 92 seats in a new parliament.    But wariness of Bank of England sterling-sellingintervention made participants cautious about pushing the poundmuch higher, dealers said.    Some dealers said the Bank of England was believed to haveintervened on a small scale yesterday but others said they hadnot detected such action. No polled dealer said he had sightedBank intervention today.    The dollar was quoted at 1.5110/20 Swiss francs atmidsession against 1.5130/40 at the opening and a 1.5180/90European close. It fetched 6.0575/0625 French francs against6.0525/75 at the opening and 6.0660/0710 at close. REUTER&#3;
