Fiji today welcomed the ending of a tradeban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of thecountry's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressurefor his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.    The government welcomed a decision by the AustralianWaterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments toFiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-electedgovernment was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.    The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the uniondecision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of riceand wheat from an Australian port, the government said.    Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugarindustry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.
