A South African trade union is indispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc overthe company's proposal to move a platinum refinery nearJohannesburg to a black tribal homeland.    The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers IndustrialUnion said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswanahomeland, where South African unions are not recognised, couldlead to job losses and affect wages.    A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum HoldingsLtd &lt;IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinumprices rocketing.    The union said talks with management over the proposed movehad broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workersshowed that most favoured striking over the move but added thatno final decision had been taken on strike action.    The refinery processes all platinum metals of RustenburgPlatinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.    It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiaryof Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned bymining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd. Reuter&#3;
