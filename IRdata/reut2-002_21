Responsibility for the appreciation ofthe Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley withthose countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter    Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is inthose countries' own long-term interest to raise the value oftheir currencies against the dollar.    Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies againstthe dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficitswith Taiwain and Korea.    "An undervalued currency will help those countries' exportsin the short term, but in the long run they have to beconcerned about how they are perceived in the internationalbusiness community," Yeutter said.    For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita tradesurplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, andwith huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defendthe high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in thatcountry.    He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to moveto reflect underlying economic fundamentals, "otherwise in twoor three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation thatprevails in Taiwan."    Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was notsustainable.    "Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threatof U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend," Yeuttersaid. Reuter&#3;
