South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billiondlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for thecountry's cheap cars and electronic goods.    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny theYonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its ownfigures later in the week.    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the currentaccount, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled7.03 billion dlrs.    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for thewhole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks withthe International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapidrevaluation of the won against the dollar.    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.    "Exports in October could be relatively modest due to manypublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus willbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," Yonhap said.    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from aresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previousmonth.    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrestbetween July and September.    The South Korean government originally targeted a fivebillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raisethis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half exportboom.    If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplusseemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the UnitedStates which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit withSeoul last year, government economists said.    The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressureat home, has called on South Korea to open more markets toAmerican goods and revalue the won faster.    The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year. REUTER&#3;
