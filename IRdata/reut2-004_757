Moody's Investors Service Inc said itdowngraded 3.4 billion dlrs of debt of Beneficial Corp.    Cut to Baa-2 from Baa-1 were the senior debt of the companyand the guaranteed debt of its unit, Beneficial OverseasFinance NV.    Also downgraded were Beneficial's shelf registrations ofsenior debt to Provisional Baa-2 from Provisional Baa-1 and ofsubordinated debt to Provisional Ba-1 from Provisional Baa-3.    Moody's said the magnitude of Beneficial's 1986 operatinglosses from write-downs of discontinued businesses has weakenedits financial position.    "The costs of meeting the potential liability for insurancelosses to facilitate the sale of the company's insurance unitand of revaluing other discontinued business segments havesubstantially exceeded original indications," Moody's said in arelease.    The agency said Beneficial's consumer finance businessremains strong and has the capacity to withstand foreseeableadverse developments.    But the withdrawal from nontraditional businesses isweakening consolidated leverage, narrowing funding operationsand depressing the quality of earnings, Moody's stressed. Reuter&#3;
