A decision by the U.S. Securities andExchange Commission to remove a key regulatory obstacle totrading foreign debt futures on U.S. Exchanges was aconstructive development, London International FinancialFutures Exchange (LIFFE) Chief Executive Michael Jenkins said.    The SEC yesterday agreed to remove the regulation againsttrading futures in designated foreign government debtsecurities on markets not located in the issuing country.    Jenkins said the decision cleared the way for the ChicagoBoard of Trade possibly to trade U.K. Long gilt futures and aJapanese yen bond contract.    The CBOT is now likely to proceed with an application totrade gilts to the Commodity Futures Trading Commmission(CFTC), he said. REUTER&#3;
