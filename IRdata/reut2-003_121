A half point cut in base lending rateswas announced by the big four clearing banks today after theBank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks ofdownward pressure, dealers said.    During its routine intervention in the market, the banktrimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses byhalf a point and National Westminster led the other clearingbanks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.    The timing of the Bank of England move took operators bysurprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampenhopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.       For some time, fundamentals haveled the market to push for a one point cut in base lendingrates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to followwholesale money market rates down.    Although political considerations -- the government's wishto see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- hadbeen suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank'sdelaying action, worries about the real strength of sterlingand perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of theBudget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealerssaid.    In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.    Consequently, rates in the money market eased during theday, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.    Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated ataround 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at theend of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated300 mln stg shortage. REUTER&#3;
