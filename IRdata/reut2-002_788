Brazil's economic crisis is forcing awholesale re-examination of the established strategy fordealing with developing-country debt, leading bankers say.    While finance minister Dilson Funaro is unlikely to succeedin his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to thedebt problem, Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68billion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at leastsome bankers that new ideas are needed.    "The time has come to look at the alternatives," oneseasoned debt rescheduler said.    Even before Brazil's move, the difficulty in syndicatingthe 77 billion dlr financing package for Mexico agreed to inprinciple last October was prompting top bankers to examine the way they are managing the debt crisis.    Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, too, spoke recentlyof "debt fatigue" and the need to breathe new life into debtrescheduling procedures.    There are already signs of change. Japanese banks aresetting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfersome LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets,improve financial management and get tax breaks.        But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental rolewill be gradual. "The process is such that you cannot expecttangible progress in a short period of time," one banker said.    Certainly, Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington andseveral European capitals in the past week when he called ongovernment officials to explain Brazil's crusade for apolitical dialogue on debt.    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford, forinstance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions suchas debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lendingagencies.    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, theyare impractical and ultimately counterproductive," Mulford tolda House subcommittee this week. He could have added that anyproposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. bankswould be a non-starter in Congress.    But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promoteaccounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swapsand debt securitization and to enable banks to considerinterest capitalization as an alternative to new loans.    Experts say the government must also make it easier forbanks gradually to write down their third-world loan books.    Mulford, in his Congressional testsimony, urged the banksto explore different options. "The banks should be encouragedto look at the so-called menu approach," he said.    Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicatesintact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off theirexposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders.    Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue toreceive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute tonew loans. In effect, large banks say they are making new loansthat fund the interest payments on the old debt.    To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersomenegotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of "exitbonds", which would be issued at a discount to small creditorsin exchange for their existing debt, bankers said. The bankswould be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss.    Amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of thecommercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny.    The principle of consensus on which the panels operate waschallenged recently when Citibank - ironically, the originalarchitect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for atime to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile.    The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington. "Theredoes seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of thebank advisory committees," a U.S. official said.    Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London onMonday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas andthat U.S. banks are over-represented on them.    Hannes Androsch, chairman of Austria'sCreditanstalt-Bankverein, said there was some truth to thecharge. "Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longerprepared to bail out the U.S. banks," he told reporters in NewYork this week.    While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently, somehave started to wonder whether the advisory committee is stillthe right tool for the job.    "The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacityof commercial banks alone, at least in some cases," one top NewYork rescheduler said.    But, with governments unable or unwilling to play a largerrole, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.    "It's the worst form of government there is apart from allthe others," one banker said, paraphrasing former British primeminister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy. Reuter&#3;
