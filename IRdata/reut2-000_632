Cuba has told international sugaroperators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March thatthese contracts will take second place to Cuba's directshipments to its export markets, dealers here said.    Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said thelanguage of the message was not totally clear and some believedshipments would be honoured if the traders declare the SovietUnion as the destination of their contracts.    The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the lastweek and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's exportavailability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.    Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediatelyavailable raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets wasprobably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tenderlast month.    Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forwarddelivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in thesale of several cargoes.    Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receiveMarch shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to exportmarkets, traders said. Reuter&#3;
