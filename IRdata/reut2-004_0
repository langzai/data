Inco Ltd said it did not expect itsearlier reported removal from the Dow Jones industrial index tomake a major impact on the company's stock.    "We don't think that individuals or institutions buy ourshares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,"spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query.    Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most activetrading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.    The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Incowas dropped to make the index more representative of themarket. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickelproducer, was a member of the index since 1928.    Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Coand Boeing Co, effective tomorrow.    Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell CochranMurray Ltd said Inco's removal from the index would likelyspark short-term selling pressure on the stock.    "Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'well,because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate thatinvestment,'" said Martens, although he added the move wasunlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock.    Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lowernickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year. Reuter&#3;
