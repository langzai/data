U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said the United States will continue its policy ofsubsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there isa global agreement to end such subsidies.    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he wastroubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exportsthat the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.    "Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit," he said. "There'sno question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,the longer it is to wean it."    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growinglist of commodities to an increasing number of countries.    Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy" and said he saw anend to the expansion of the EEP.    "I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doingthis to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets thatwe've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, arethe worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, thatwe are prepared to continue to do this until we can come tosome agreement to put an end to it," he said.
