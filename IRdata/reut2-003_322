Officials of major brokerage firmsexpressed dismay at a New York Stock Exchange decision to forcestrict compliance with a rule barring members from trading inNYSE-listed issues in London during New York trading hours.    Most major brokerage houses said they had seen no formalnotice from the NYSE on the interpretation of rule 390.Officials of the NYSE were unavailable to explain the timing orthe technical details of enforcement of rule 390.    "It's a step backward," said Samuel Hunter, senior vicepresident for equity trading at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,    Hunter said any perceived problems caused by overlappingtrading ought to be addressed by a search for equitablesolutions instead of "hiding behind legalistic and technicaldefinitions."    The NYSE evidently feels some traders use London tocircumvent rules preventing short sales on minus ticks, Huntersaid. But he believes simultaneous printing of trades in Londonand New York would be a way to have dual trading with anelement of fairness. "I'm a great advocate of the view that thegreater the volume, the better the market will be," he said. Reuter&#3;
