The agreement by the seven-member Association of TinProducing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus andboost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subrotoappealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases fromits strategic stockpile.    "We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a largeinfluence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," saidThomas O'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at theState Department.
