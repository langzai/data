Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Norandawill operate the mine at about one-third of its normal 72,000metric ton annual finished capacity, using above groundreserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.    "The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are avery serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations," Lefebvre said.Gaspe Mines is the name of the Noranda division that operatesthe Murdochville mine.    He said it would take four or five months to bringoperations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so,adding that he believes there is a good chance Noranda willfully reopen the mine.
