Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) willgrow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988,said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc(DRI).    Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at aconference that Italian GDP growth this year "will be mainlydriven by consumption and especially investment."    Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next yearwill shift from domestic demand to exports as a result ofexpected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.    Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7pct in real terms in 1986.    DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pctin 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interestrates should drop two pct.    Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pctagainst the dollar this year following last year's 22 pctappreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against thedollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of itsvalue relative to the German currency, he said.    DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian productsshould grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year's 6.2pct increase. REUTER&#3;
