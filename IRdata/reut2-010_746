Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1pct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct inDecember but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November andOctober, Statistics Canada said.    January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output inservices-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December'slevel.    January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month ayear ago.    The federal agency said it was the second straight gain forgoods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred inmanufacturing and construction.    Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobilesand parts, however.    In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance andcommunication were more than offset by declines intransportation, storage and the retail trade. Reuter&#3;
