Eastman Kodak Co, best known for itscameras and film products, took several steps today to boostits image as a diversified information systems company.    The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of newelectronic data and image storage systems that can create vastcomputerized libraries of documents and pictures.    Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emergingmarket for such systems, sales of which are expected to reachfive billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years maypass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line.    Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign topromote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging marketwhat IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J.Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's businessimaging systems division.    While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs insales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said salesof copiers, electronic storage systems and other businessproducts will exceed four billion dlrs this year.    "We're launching a major attack on these new markets,"Greco said.    "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be itsbread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman.    But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton andCo, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmeron sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumerphotography products. "The critical problem will be turning aprofit," he said.     Kodak also announced the first commerically available14-inch optical disk. Kodak said the disk can store theequivalent of the contents of 110 file cabinet drawers. Reuter&#3;
