Four U.S. meat processors have askedthe federal government to relax a labelling requirement whichthey said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allowmechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels asthe species from which it was derived.    For example, "pork" would be listed on the ingredientsstatement instead of "mechanically separated pork."    Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat productwould have to be stated on the label and the mechanicallyseparated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meatand poultry portion of the product.    Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-costproduct that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.    Current regulations allow use of mechanically separatedingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultryproduct, but require it to be listed in the ingredientstatement as "mechanically separated (species)," USDA said.    USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoidusing mechanically separated meat in their products because theterm carries an "unwarranted negative connotation" in the mindsof many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similarregulation exists for poultry products.    Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcassparts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have someremaining meat, into specialized processing equipment. Reuter&#3;
