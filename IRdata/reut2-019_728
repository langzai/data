The American Hospital Association saidthe best way to prevent the spread of AIDS to hospital workersis for workers to wear protective clothing rather than throughroutine tests of all hospital patients for the disease.    The non-profit advocacy organization, which representshospitals and patients, recommended that hospital workersshould wear protective gear whenever there is a chance theywill be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids, regardless ofwhether the fluids are known to be infected with AIDS.    The group also said that "reliance on negative AIDS testresults to determine when to take specific precautions can leadto a false sense of security among health care workers."    So far there are nine cases on record of hospital workerscontracting AIDS from hospital patients. Despite the low riskof contracting, the group said, "Hospital workers areunderstandly concerned about their vulnerability (to AIDS)."    There are 3.6 mln workers in the nation's hospitals withnurses and housekeepers the most likely to come in contact withblood and body fluids on a daily basis, the group said.    Among the Americal Hospital Association's recommendationswere that health care workers exposed to body fluids must weargloves, and in some cases, gowns, masks, and eye coverings. Reuter&#3;
