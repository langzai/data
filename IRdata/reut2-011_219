The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a jointstatement.    The previously announced float of part of its Delhiinterest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.    Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, whichholds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-ledCooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equallyin any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensateprices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi'sinterests in the next two years, the statement said.    "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest willbe more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with thefloat," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focusefforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and buildingmaterials in which CSR has had long and successful managementexperience and strong market leadership.    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businessesmore aggressively and earlier, he said.    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhisale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;PioneerSugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing itsentire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.
