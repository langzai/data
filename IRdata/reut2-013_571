Shifts in domestic economic policy,not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are thekey to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch FinanceMiniister H. Onno Ruding said.    Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here thatprotectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravatethe problems of heavily indebted developing countries.    "The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmousU.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in thedollar, is not still more protectionism in your country."    "No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domesticeconomic and financial policies," Ruding said.    Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of theweakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accordto stabilize foreign exchange rates.    He said the highest priority should be given to policychanges in the United States, especially reducing the budgetdeficit and encouraging domestic savings.    But he said other countries, such as Japan and WestGermany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducingtheir trade surpluses. Reuter&#3;
