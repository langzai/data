The New Zealand Government will sell25 pct of state-owned &lt;Air New Zealand Ltd> to the public,Civil Aviation minister Richard Prebble said.    Prebble said in a statement the government would appoint anadviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, thetiming of any sales and the price.    "Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of otherproposed share issues so as to enter the market at the bestopportunity," Prebble said.    "We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air NewZealand," he said.    "Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If thatmeans waiting for a while, then so be it," Prebble said.    He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soonfor the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident itwould post an excellent profit.    Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its abilityto prosper in future was hampered by itswholly-government-owned status.    Prebble said access to new sources of capital wouldincrease its ability to expand and develop.    This sale announcement follows the public float in March ofaround 13 pct of the &lt;Bank of New Zealand Ltd>.    The government has said it will also float part of thecapital of other state-owned operations, including &lt;DFC NewZealand Ltd>, formerly Development Finance Corp of New ZealandLtd, and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd.
