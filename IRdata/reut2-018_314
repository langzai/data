The Securities and Exchange Commissioncharged Windsor Holding Co, a Chicago-based lamp and ceilingfan maker, with fraudulently overstating its 1982 and 1983pre-tax income by a total of 3.6 mln dlrs.    Simultaneously with the filing of the civil case in U.S.District Court here, the company, formerly Windsor IndustriesInc, three former officers and a former director, agreed tosettle the charges without admitting or denying them.    But under the settlement, the company and the otherdefendants consented to court orders barring them fromcommitting further violations of securities law.    There were no monetary penalties in the settlement and thecompany, which was delisted from the National Association ofSecurities Dealers Automated Quotation, NASDAQ, system in May1985, was not required to restate its earnings.    The SEC charged Jose Arrojo, a vice president of a Windsorsubsidiary, Ronald Kahn, former vice of the company, and DavidGarvin, former president of a Windsor subsidiary, with takingpart in a scheme to inflate the value of Windsor's 1982year-end inventory, resulting in a 2.0 mln dlr overstatement ofthe company's pre-tax income for that year.    The company's inventory was again falsified a year later,resulting in a 1.6 mln dlr overstatement, the SEC charged.    Another defendant, Arthur Usheroff, a former Windsor boardmember, the company and Kahn also failed to disclose in an SECfiling an arrangement under which Usheroff was compensated forservices rendered in a 1983 Windsor public stock offering, theagency said.    Arrojo, Kahn and the company were also charged with makingfalse statements in required SEC filings.    Windsor filed for bankruptcy in August 1985 and had a planof reorganization approved last December. Reuter&#3;
