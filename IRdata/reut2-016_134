A major animal feed producer, CehaveNV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against theapplication of the European Community grain co-responsibilitylevy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feedtrade association, Het Comite, association chief executivePeter Pex told Reuters.    Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and thecourt said it would give its verdict within six weeks. "However,that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court torefer questions on the interpretation and application of thelevy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," Pex added.    Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not takeaccount of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean acompounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy inits own national currency than it received down the chain fromthe original producer of the grain.    "We would like the Business Administration Court in theHague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whetherthe Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but alsowhether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,"Pex said.    "It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,but we have had no political help, and therefore have no optioneven though it could take years," Pex added.    Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against thegrain levy because the bill the company received from thecommodity board included grain from a wide variety of originsand was therefore considered to be the best general basis for alegal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.    Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions onthe levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a casebrought by the Association of European Animal FeedManufacturers, FEFAC. REUTER&#3;
