The Commission blamed the EC's new cash crisis on the"considerable reluctance" of governments to pay for decisionsthey themselves have taken.    "Budgetary practices have emerged which fictitiouslydisguise the real impact of expenditure decisions," it said.Adding that such practices were unacceptable.
