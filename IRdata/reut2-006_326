China said it will continue its effortsto cut excessive capital investment, and noted policies to coolthe economy have so far failed.    Fixed asset investment grew 16.7 pct to 296.7 billion yuanin 1986, outstripping energy and raw materials growth, theChina Daily quoted Zhou Daojiong, president of the People'sConstruction Bank of China, as saying.    Over 160,000 projects costing 895 billion yuan are nowunder construction, and will absorb 60 pct of the fundsearmarked for investment under China's current five-yeareconomic plan (1986-1990), he said.    The state-run construction bank will review all investmentprojects now under way or scheduled, and immediately halt thosedeemed unnecessary or with a poor economic return, Zhou said.    Over 20 billion yuan of unauthorised spending by localgovernments or enterprises were partly responsible for theoverheated rate of investment, he said.    Another two or three years of measures to curb excessiveinvestment were needed to bring it under control, Zhou said. REUTER&#3;
