U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said there is more confidence in British financialinstitutions than in U.S. Equivalents, so there is no need foran official statement that the Bank of England will provideliquidity to the U.K. Financial system.    "Our institutions are in a stronger position, I think, andthe state of confidence is very much higher in this country soI see no need for the Bank of England...To make any statementof that kind," he said in an interview on Channel Fourtelevision.    Earlier a pledge to provide such liquidity from U.S.Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan reassured worldmarkets.    Lawson said the Bank of England also saw no reason toprovide such reassurance.    The Bank of England had earlier declined comment.    Analysts said Greenspan's pledge that the Fed would standbehind the U.S. Financial system reassured markets that thecurrent turmoil should not spill over into the rest of theeconomy through a crisis in a financial institution caught outby heavy equity price losses and bond price volatility.
