China posted a budget deficit of 7.08billion yuan in 1986, the fourth highest since 1949, after asurplus of 2.82 billion in 1985, Finance Minister Wang Bingqiantold the National People's Congress.    He put 1986 revenue at 222.03 billion yuan, against abudgeted 214.17 billion, and up from 185.41 billion in 1985,and expenditure at 229.11 billion, against a budgeted 214.17billion and 182.59 billion in 1985.    Official figures show the record post-1949 budget deficitwas 17 billion yuan in 1979.    Wang said the 1986 deficit was due to excess capitalconstruction and administrative expenses and unjustified andextravagant investments outside the state plan.    He also blamed the inefficiency of firms whose productioncosts and losses rose. He said subsidising state firms' lossescost 32.25 billion yuan. The 1985 budget did not give aseparate figure for this.    He said the processing industry developed too fast and someprojects could not start operations because of power shortages,while too many non-productive facilities were set up.    Wang said 1986 and 1985 investment in fixed assets rose15.3 pct and 41.8 pct respectively year on year and consumptionfunds rose 12.5 pct and 23.7 pct, outstripping the growth innational income.    Wang said revenues were affected by the steep fall in worldoil prices, the decline in the price of primary products, adrop in income from customs duties and the rising cost ofearning foreign exchange through exports.    Revenue also fell because the state raised the rate ofdepreciation for fixed assets of certain state firms, reducedtheir regulatory tax and made other tax cuts for firms.    Wang said 1986 tax receipts rose to 206.45 billion yuanfrom 201.82 billion in 1985, state treasury bond receipts to6.2 billion from 6.04 billion and receipts from foreign loansrose to 7.87 billion from 2.5 billion.    He said 1986 budgetary spending on capital constructionrose to 65.57 billion yuan from 56.97 billion in 1985, ontechnical renovation and new products to 12.62 billion from10.05 billion, aid to rural production and other farm expensesto 12.03 billion from 10.16 billion, culture, science,education and public health to 38 billion from 31.72 billionand defence to 20.13 billion from 19.15 billion.     Wang said expenditure for repaying principal and intereston foreign loans in 1986 was 3.4 billion yuan, up from 3.26billion in 1985. REUTER&#3;
