France's state-owned Cie Generaled'Electricite (CGE) is likely to be privatised during May thisyear, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.    Although the Finance Ministry simply said that the groupwould be privatised during the course of this year, when itfirst announced the operation in early January, the May date isearlier than the market had expected.    As a result it will follow close on the heels of theprivatisation of the TF1 television channel and the advertisinggroup &lt;Agence Havas>.    Last month the government privatised the first of the statefinancial groups, Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.P>, in afloatation which was 40 times oversubscribed.    And in December the first of the industrial groups, glassmaker Cie de Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.P>, returned to the privatesector.    CGE has interests ranging from telecommunications toshipbuilding and nuclear engineering, and recently struck adeal with ITT Corp &lt;ITT.N> to create the world's second largesttelecommunications group under the Alcatel name.
