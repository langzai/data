The U.S. Has approved the sale of aU.S.-made supercomputer to India while rejecting its requestfor a more powerful model, the New York Times reported.    India wanted to buy a powerful supercomputer, such as theCray X-MP with two processors running in tandem, but the Timessaid U.S. Officials offered a choice of machines with a singleprocessor, several generations behind the Cray X-MP.    The paper, citing unnamed U.S. Officials, said the Indiangovernment was told of the decision last week, but has so fargiven no formal indication that it is interested in the typeoffered.    India had asked the U.S. For an modern supercomputer whichit indicated would be used for scientific purposes, notablysophisticated weather forecasting.    However, India's close ties with the Soviet Union remainsthe main reason why the U.S. Has restricted the sale of itsstate-of-the-art computer technology to India, the Times said.    U.S. Defence officials are particulalry concerned theSoviet Union could gain access to the supercomputer and use itto decipher high-level U.S. Codes, while others say thecomputer could be very useful in designing nuclear weapons.
