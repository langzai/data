Praxis Pharmaceuticals Inc, which ownsworldwide licensing rights to the promising AIDS treatmentAL721, said large scale tests of the drug are planned for thissummer in the United States.    Arnold Lippa, Praxis' president, said Praxis will test thedrug in a few hundred patients with full-blown AIDS, in thosewith AIDS-related complex, a precursor to AIDS, and in morepatients with swollen lymph glands but no other AIDS symptoms.    Praxis reported a net loss of 2,186,000 dlrs for the yearended June 30, 1986. Lippa said the firm has about two mln dlrsleft from its public offering in January 1985.    But Lippa expects to "easily spend" five to 10 mln dlrs inthese new clinical trials. He said the Beverly-Hills,Calif.-based company is preparing a private offering anddiscussing ventures with other pharmaceutical firms to helpfinance the cost of the trials.    As another mark of the interest in AL721, Anthony S. Fauci,who heads the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDisease, said the government will begin testing AL721 in itsAIDS treatment evaluation units in June.    A spokeswoman said the study will be "small" and willestablish the drug's toxicity. She said the study will be"expedited" to allow the next phase of testing to proceedrapidly.    These plans follow the completion of a small-scale test ofthe drug's effectiveness in eight patients with AIDS-relatedlymphadenopathy--swollen lymph glands, at St. Lukes/RooseveltHospital in New York, and another study of 14 AIDS patients inIsrael, where the drug was developed.
