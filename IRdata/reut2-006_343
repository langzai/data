The sale of the government's 25.55 pctstake in VEBA AG &lt;VEBG.F> is still expected this month, bankingsources closely linked with the transaction said.    A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date hadyet been set for the privatisation, which the government hastabled for the second half of March. However, he added ascandal at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, over currency losses "hasnothing to do" with the timing of the VEBA sale.    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale ofthe Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled forlater this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.    A banker involved in the VEBA placement said "Nothing haschanged in the planning. I still presume that it will takeplace in the second half of March."    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone theissue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added thatthe consortium which is arranging the deal had completed itspreparatory work, although the price had not been decided.    The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement butWest German stocks have been generally bearish and news of theVW scandal last week put further pressure on the market. REUTER&#3;
