But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, SaudiArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse aresolution on a common currency exchange rate system.    The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, AhmedHumaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks thatthe ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bankgovernors for further discussion.    He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposeddenominator on which the six currencies should be based, wereasked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when financeministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia.    Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon todiscuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a newsystem could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summitconference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year.    The denominator approved by the governors has not been madepublic, but banking sources said it could be similar to theEuropean Monetary System (EMS).    Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCCcitizens to set up businesses and work in any member state.They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizensto buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms.
