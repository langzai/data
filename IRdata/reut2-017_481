The supercomputer industry is gettingcrowded as a handful of startup companies and some hugeJapanese manufacturers compete for the right to apply the label"world's fastest machine" to their products.    Currently there are only about 250 supercomputers installedaround the world, but many believe that situation is about tochange dramatically as these highly specialized and extremelyexpensive machines move out of the research laboratories wheremost of them are found today and into commerical applications.    "It is commercial supercomputing... that holds the mostpromise for this young industry's handful of vendors," saidGary Smaby, supercomputer analyst for Piper Jaffray andHopwood.    These commercial applications, he said, could propel annualsales of supercomputers from 850 mln dlrs in 1986 to 2.4billion by 1990.    For years two companies, Cray Research Inc &lt;CYR> andControl Data Corp  &lt;CDA> were virtually the only options forcustomers seeking to buy supercomputers.    But in the last three years a number of new companies haveannounced supercomputers using some innovative technologies,and the industry finally expanded enough to hold its firstWorld Supercomputer Exhibition in Santa Clara last month.    Also in the last month two small companies, ETA Systems Inc(a subsidiary of Control Data) and Thinking Machines Corp  bothlaid claim to having the world's fastest computer and a jointventure of Honeywell Inc &lt;HON> and Japan's NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T>Honeywell-NEC Supercomputers Inc, announced its entrance intothe U.S. market.    All three are aiming at industry leader Cray Research Inc,which holds more than 60 pct of the market.    This week, Cray plans to make a joint announcement withDigital Equipment Corp, &lt;DEC> already the world's largestminicomputer maker, of some products that will work on bothcompanies' computers, expanding the market opportunities forboth supers and minis even further.    Supercomputers were initially designed only for the mostcomplex of applications, such as predicting worldwide weatherpatterns, fusion energy research or military defense andweapons design.    They are built for speed, not for standard businessfunctions such as payroll processing. The fastestsupercomputers can perform more than a billion calculations persecond, greater than the combined power of 100,000 personalcomputers.    They also carry stratospheric price tags of between one mlnto 20 mln dlrs each, which is why Cray's revenues could reach600 mln dlrs last year even though it only shipped 36 new and10 used supercomputers, a level that would spell starvation forany standard computer company.            But speakers at the supercomputer exhibition emphasizedthat a host of new applications should increase total industryshipments to 150 systems a year by the end of the decade.    Most commercial customers of supercomputers now use themachines to simulate a physical process, such as the flow ofair over an aircraft wing, in design and testing work.    But financial institutions, particularly Wall Streetbrokerage houses, are considered the next major buyers ofsupercomputers as they try to recognize changes in stocktrading patterns faster than any of their competitors.    Two firms, Goldman Sachs and Co and Morgan Stanley and Co,are now using superminicomputers, hybrid machines that arefaster than a minicomputer but cheaper than a super, to createfinancial models of the stock and bond markets.    Analysts said it is only a matter of time before actualsupercomputers are found on Wall Street.    One reason for the shift to commercial applications is thatsupercomputers are coming down in price as new technologiesprovide greater speed at lower costs than the Cray and ControlData behemoths.    Both the ETA and Thinking Machines Systems use a technologycalled parallel processing, in which a number of internalprocessors work together to solve a problem.    With such systems a problem is broken up and differentsegments are assigned to different processors. By contrast,standard computers solve a problem one instruction at a time,or sequentially.    The ETA system, the ETA 10, will eventually use as many aseight parallel processors capable of processing up to 8.32billion operations per second.    However, the first ETA 10, installed at Florida StateUniversity, has only two processors, later to be expanded tofour.  ETA president Lloyd Thorndyke said the ETA 10 representsa drastic change in architecture from parent company ControlData's Cyber system.    Priced from 5.5 mln to 22 mln dlrs, the ETA 10 containsabout 240 chips in each of its processing units, built onto aboard about the size of a standard newspaper section.    Each of these boards contains the equivalent of 1.5 milesof embedded wiring.    It took ETA about 3-1/2 years to develop its supercomputerbut Thorndyke said he expects much faster development timeframes in the futre, from both ETA and its competitors.    "We're in a leapfrog business and we just took the lastleap," he said.    Thinking Machines also claims to have the world's fastestcomputer and in some ways this is true. Its Connection MachineModel CM-2 can process 2.5 billion instructions per second, butit is a very specialized architecture only meant for certainvery specific applications.    The one mln to five mln dlr Connection Machine uses atechnology called "massive parallism." It contains 64,000processors crammed into a five foot cube. The processors allwork on a problem at once, breaking it down into minute bits.    It is an ideal tool for applications with manyunpredicatble variables, according to Brian Boyle, analyst forNovon Research Group. "The more unpredictable things are, themore the Thinking Machine will be appropriate," he said.        Reuter&#3;
