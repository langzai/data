Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone'sunpopular sales tax plan suffered another dent today whenmembers of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called fortime to be taken in dealing with the proposed sales tax, partyofficials said.    The call came in a resolution adopted by a group of some150 LDP parliamentarians and secretaries, acting on behalf oftheir parliamentarians, at a meeting at the LDP headquarters,they said. The MPs represented seemed to Account for one-thirdof LDP MPs.    The group is an LDP voluntary organisation, called theParliamentarians' Research Society for Reestablishment ofFinances claiming a membership of about 300 MPs, they said.    Meanwhle, Nakasone this evening hinted that his party mightbe ready to accept some modification to the five-pct sales taxproposal after the fiscal 1987 state budget plan was passed byparliament. The LDP suffered a setback in last Sunday's localelections because of the controvertial tax plan. The resultalso undermined Nakasone's prestige, giving rise to apossibility that he might be forced out of office beforeOctober 30, when he is supposed to step down. REUTER&#3;
