The failure of the West German governmentto abolish a tax on bourse turnover when other taxes came underdiscussion during recent coalition negotiations was a "bitterdisappointment," the president of the West German Federation ofBanks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth, said.    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference that, contraryto numerous assurances from the government, the abolition ofthe turnover tax had not been touched upon.    "This must not be allowed to be the last word. Otherwise amajor chance for West Germany as a financial centre will havebeen missed," he said.    After the January 25 election the government decided upon areform of the West German tax system, involving gross tax cutsof 44 billion marks, which would be implemented in 1990.    In line with a pledge made by Bonn at the February monetaryconference in Paris, the government said earlier this monthpart of the planned tax cuts would be effective next year.    Government sources have said the fact the latest coalitiondiscussions did not touch upon the bourse turnover tax does notnecessarily rule out the possibility that it could be abolishedlater in the current four-year legislative period.    The bourse turnover tax, levied on securities trades wherean end-investor is involved, generated government revenue ofsome 750 mln marks in 1986, according to the Finance Ministry.    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said there were no fiscal reasons formaintaining the tax because companies would benefit from itsabolition. Their earnings would increase and the governmentwould receive more in profits tax.    Wolfgang Roeller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank AG, saidthe bourse tax decision did not fit into the general backgroundof liberalisation of the German capital market, and representeda weakening of West Germany as a financial centre.
