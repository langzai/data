West Germany's foreign trade and currentaccount surpluses are expected to decline only slightly in 1987from their record levels last year, economists said.    Figures released by the Federal Statistics Office inWiesbaden showed that in the first five months of the year thetrade surplus grew 15.7 pct compared with the same 1986 periodto 47.2 billion marks. The current account surplus rose 9.8 pctto 33.7 billion marks.    West Germany reported a 1986 current account surplus of 77billion marks and a trade surplus of 113 billion marks.    Economists had expected the rise of the mark from year-agolevels to have started biting more strongly into the nominalsurpluses.    The real surpluses are already declining. The StatisticsOffice said after cheaper import prices were taken intoconsideration, West Germany's imports by volume rose by morethan three pct in the first five months.    Exports had risen by only about one pct in real terms. Thegovernment has pointed to this stronger real rise in importsthan exports when rejecting international pressure to boostdomestic consumption.    The Statistics Office said West Germany's trade surplus hadrisen in May to 10.6 billion marks, from 8.9 billion in Apriland 8.1 billion in May last year.    The current account surplus had risen to 7.5 billion marksin May from 6.1 billion in April and 6.3 billion marks a yearearlier.    Exports rose strongly from the year-ago month by 6.6 pct to43.31 billion marks, while May imports of 32.76 billion markshad risen only 0.8 pct in the year.    The Ifo economic research institute in Munich said in astudy published today that the trade surplus would probablyonly fall to around 101 billion marks this year, compared withthe 113 billion mark 1986 record.    It predicted a fall in the current account surplus to 61billion marks from 77 billion.    Ifo said this reduction would only be "a small step on theway to reducing imbalances in the world economy."    Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank AG, predicteda 1987 trade surplus of 100 billion marks. He saw a slightlyhigher current account surplus than Ifo of possibly 65 billionmarks.    Helmut Henschel, with Westdeutsche Landesbank, put the 1987trade surplus at 95 billion marks and the current accountsurplus at 60 billion marks.    He said the strong rise in exports in May from the year-agoperiod was surprising but it probably reflected calendarfactors. REUTER&#3;
