Toyota Motor Co expects its U.S. vehiclesales in 1988 will decline to about 875,000 cars and trucksfrom roughly 930,000 expected in 1987, a senior exeuctive said.    Jim Perkins, group vice president for sales and marketingfor Toyota's U.S. sales subsidiary, told reporters Toyota'sexpected decline will come principally in the truck segmentwhere the company faces intense competition from U.S. domesticmanufacturers such as Ford Motor Co &lt;F>.    Toyota, he said, also expects to stress sales in the lowand middle segments of the car market to remain competitive.    Asked if Toyota's U.S. profits could show a substantialdecline with its lower trucks sales in the next two years, heresponded "conceivably it could," but added, "Our plan is notto chase this thing to where it makes no economic sense."    Perkins also predicted that the 1988 U.S. vehicle marketcould fall below 15 mln sales from above 15 mln expected thisyear. He expects some smaller Japanese automakers could beforced to withdraw from the U.S. market or to seek partnershipswith one another in the face of intense competition.     The Toyota executive said the collapse of U.S. stockprices and any further weakening of the dollar would likelyhave "a very quick impact on the Japanese (car) companies."    "In our company, when the stock market goes down, we see itvery soon in the New York metropolitan car market. New York isthe best indicator of what's going to happen in the rest of ofthe country. I can tell you from the next 15 days (of carsales) in the New York market what it will be in the rest ofthe country in the next six months," Perkins said.     The Toyota executive said the panic selloff in the NewYork Stock Exchange hurts the car market because "it doescreate a shock wave of doubt in the minds of consumers."     He said Toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assessthe impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economybefore making any changes in its basic business plan for theU.S. market.    Toyota, he said, expects its 1988 U.S. sales will total atleast 600,000 cars and 275,000 trucks compared with about630,000 cars and 300,000 trucks expected for 1987, and 644,000cars and 388,000 trucks sold in 1986.    He said Toyota hopes it will be able to import 610,000 carsfrom Japan in 1988, the same as its 1987 allocation underTokyo's voluntary export restraint scheme.    But he said it was uncertain if Toyota would keep itscurrent allocation becuase of pressures on Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry to roll back Japanese carexport quotas from the current 2.3 mln annualized rate.
