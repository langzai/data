About 14,000 of Brazil's 40,000seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shippingcompanies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman atstrike headquarters said today.    The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27.    The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro,said 126 ships were strike-bound.    He added that because of resignations by many seamen therewere scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships.    The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pctwith the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners' associationSyndarma have been deadlocked over overtime.    While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporterssay the problems have been manageable.    "It hasn't been critical by any means," said a coffee traderin Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreignships.    Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exportsserved to aggravate Brazil's balance of payments crisis, whichlast month prompted the government to suspend interest paymentson 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.
