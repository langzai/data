The Soviet economy recovered slightlylast month after a poor performance in January, but majorindustries, including oil and machinery, are still short ofproduction targets, official figures show.    Central Statistical Board data published in the weeklyEkonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial outputwas only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over thesame period of last year.    However, the figure for January alone showed a fall inoutput of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targettedto increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987.    The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises mettheir supply obligations in January and February.    Production of oil, the country's main export to Westernnations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct.    Economists said this reflected the huge investments pouredinto the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reversethe stagnation in production which began in November 1983.    Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a declinein Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6billion in 1985.    Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targetswere also not fulfilled, but did not give figures.    Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionallybad weather at the start of the year and stricter qualitycontrols imposed on enterprises.    Production in the machine-building sector, a priority inMoscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly inFebruary but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months ofthe year compared with the same period of 1986.    The figures showed that five republics produced less thanin the first two months of 1986. REUTER&#3;
