Agriculture Ministry officials said theyare not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to helpease friction with the United States over agricultural trade.    Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we mustconsider domestic market conditions, an official said.    Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct inApril 1983.    Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct,equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said.    Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show.    However, the ministry sources added it is possible thegovernment may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. AndEuropean demand.    "Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S.,Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cutthe duties," one said.    But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve itsoverall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus,which reached 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.    Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the U.S.Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products. REUTER&#3;
