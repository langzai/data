The Canadian federal government isbacking down on its plans to give Vancouver and Montrealspecial status as international banking centers, Ontario'sminister of financial institutions Monte Kwinter said.    He told journalists that little concrete activity had takenplace since the announcement in February 1986 that the twocities would gain a special status, while Toronto, despite itsposition as Canada's main financial centre, would not.    "They (the federal government) have sent a confusing signalto world financial markets," Kwinter said. "It was done forpolitical reasons and it's going to backfire on them."    Kwinter said rules for the equity requirements for foreignbanks coming in under Ontario's financial deregulation had alsonot yet been agreed between federal and provincial governments.    While the federal government wanted to set up a regulatoryauthority for banks, Ontario was pushing to regulate accordingto function, arguing that those in the securities industry, nomatter if bank or broker, should be regulated in the same way.    On June 30, Ontario is to introduce rules to allow banks,insurances and trust companies, as well as non-securitiesinvestors, to buy dealers. Non-residents will be allowed to ownup to 50 pct of market makers, rising to 100 pct after a year. Reuter&#3;
