The U.S. Agriculture Department saidit will begin charging interest tomorrow on the over 12 mlndlrs the Department of Transportation, DOT, owes USDA to payfor its share of the cost of shipping food aid on U.S. vessels.    USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told the SenateAppropriations Agriculture Subcommittee his department hadbilled DOT 12 mln dlrs, and that interest on that amount and anadditional charge would begin accruing April 1.    USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator ThomasKay told Reuters DOT could owe USDA as much as 20 mln dlrs.    The two departments are trying to hammer out an accord onhow to fund the increasing share of food aid required to beshipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provisionon cargo preference.    Sims said the agencies were near to reaching a memorandumof understanding governing how DOT would pay for its share ofthe cargo preference costs.    Under the 1985 bill, the percentage of food aid shipmentscarried on U.S. vessels was to increase gradually over threeyears to 75 pct in 1988 from 50 pct.    Although the increased cost was to be funded by DOT, Simssaid that department to date has contributed no money. Reuter&#3;
