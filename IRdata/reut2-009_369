&lt;Greenwood Resources Inc> said if it is unsuccessful in gaining shareholder approval fora debt refinancing with Colorado National Bankshares Inc&lt;COLC>, the bank will have the right to foreclose onGreenwood's assets.    On January 28, Greenwood's board approved an agreement withColorado National calling for the sale of 4,300,000 shares ofNew London Oil owned by Greenwood for 1,700,000 dlrs andcalling for a restructuring and recapitalizing of Greenwood,subject to shareholder approval.    As a result of declines in the value of oil and natural gasproperties brought on by the fall in prices for those fuels,Greenwood started facing substantial bank debt prepaymentrequirements in 1986.    The New London shares are to be sold to a party in London.    On February 1, Colorado National released to the companyall cash flow from oil and natural gas operations and reducedits debt in return for the payment of 1,700,000 dlrs from thesale of the New London stock and other considerations.  Eightypct of Greenwood's cash flow from oil and gas operations hadbeen allocated to servicing debt to the bank.    Under the deal with Colorado National, existing preferredand common stocks would be converted into a new common stock,subject to shareholder approval.    The company said it expects to file proxy materials for thespecial meeting of shareholders at which the matter will beconsidered by the first week of April, mail material toshareholders by early May and schedule the meeting for about 30days thereafter.    It said its 1985 audit -- not conducted at the end of thatyear due to lack of funds -- is being conducted now, along withthe 1986 audit, by Touche Ross and Co.    Greenwood said as soon as its 1985 audit is completed, itwill apply for readmission to the NASDAQ system, from which itwas delisted last year.    It also said it probably plans to change its name toGreenwood Holdings due to its planned redirection from naturalresources. Reuter&#3;
