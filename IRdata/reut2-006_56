Italy's response to protests by U.S.Soybean producers about the proposed European Community (EC)tax on vegetable oils and fats had not been encouraging,American Soybean Association (ASA) board chairman GeorgeFluegel said.    Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producerdelegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, toldReuters in an interview meetings with officials from theItalian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yieldedmuch to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against theproposed tax.    Fluegel said his delegation had received a negativeresponse from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that theattitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared "more realistic."    He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S.Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance theEC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds.    Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote againstthe proposed tax, he said, "Realistically, from the informationwe're getting, it looks like the English, the Germans,hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark." His delegation alsohoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue, he added.    Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action mighttake in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved,Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products couldbe involved.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the ECyesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted thetax.    ASA president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in TheHague American soybean producers were confident the proposedtax would be rejected. Reuter&#3;
