General Acquisition Co said it wasdisappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer andasked how the company might give better value to shareholders.    Gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlrper share tender offer from General Acquisition, an affiliateof Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc, and said it wasstudying financially superior alternatives.    The General Acquisition partnership called the responseinflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had triedto discuss the offer with Gencorp.    The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it wouldprovide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt toprevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poisonpill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plans that maketakeovers more expensive.    Gencorp said in its statement earlier that it planned toput off the date its rights will trade separately from thecommon stock to April 6 from April 3. It said the extension wassubject to further extensions by the board and is conditionalon no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or moreof Gencorp before April 6.    General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can becompleted in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.    The partnership in its statement again urged Gencorpmanagement to work with it to facilitate a transaction. REUTER&#3;
