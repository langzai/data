Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia,Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow todiscuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing andways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.    The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in thefour countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.    This is the first time Indonesia is attending such ameeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may notbe able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia,Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubberexports and Singapore is a major regional rubber tradingcentre.    The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting andcontracts for rubber are among other issues expected to bediscussed.    Last month, rubber importing and exporting countriesadopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva.The new pact is more responsive to market trends than itspredecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowingthe buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.
