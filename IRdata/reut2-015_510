The head of Spain's employers'federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worriedabout the government's monetary policies because high realinterest rates were hampering investment.    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflationtarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.    High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986.    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling.    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the firsttwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pctincrease over the corresponding period last year.    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of thepeseta to correct the imbalance. REUTER&#3;
