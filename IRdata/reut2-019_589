Talks between the European Community(EC) and the United States have failed to settle a tradedispute over pasta, an EC Commission spokesman said.    Diplomatic sources said the dispute could provoke new tradefriction unless it was settled soon.    Washington is insisting that the EC comply with what itregards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATTand cut export subsidies which have allowed Italy to take anincreasing share of the U.S. pasta market.    The EC provides subsidies of about 16 cents a pound onpasta exports. The spokeswoman said the talks foundered on thequestion of how much the subsidy should be cut. Reuter&#3;
