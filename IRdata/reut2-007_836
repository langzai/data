The all-party House of Commons FinanceCommittee has unanimously called for a "substantial" cut incredit card interest rates charged by banks and other financialinstitutions.    In a report, the committee recommended that if action isnot taken soon, the government should investigate whether thereis "anti-competitive behaviour" among the banks.    Minister of State for Finance Tom Hockin told the Commonsprior to the release of the report he favored a cut in therates and promised to act quickly on its recommendations.    The committee said interest rates should be lowered to nomore than the 15.9 pct per annum level announced recently bythe Toronto Dominion Bank.    Rates on other bank cards range from 18 to 21 pct and to 24to 28 pct on gasoline and department store cards.    At a news conference, committee members said they wouldcall for a legislated rate ceiling if the banks do not takeaction quickly.    "I would be unhappy if they didn't make an announcementnext week," said Committee Chairman Don Blenkarn, also a memberof the ruling Progressive Conservative Party.    New Democratic Party member Michael Cassidy said, "I hopethe banks see the writing on the wall and take appropriateaction."    The group did recommend legislation be enacted to ensure auniform method of calculating interest on unpaid balances andthat a grace period be allowed for new purchases. Reuter&#3;
