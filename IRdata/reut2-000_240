Indonesia's raw sugar output is likelyto be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 andbelow the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S.Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.    Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on worldmarkets in late 1986, the report said.    The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugarproduction at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of1.99 mln.    It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiencyin 1984 may have been short-lived.    The report said, "The government continues to promotesugarcane production through its smallholder intensificationprogram and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcaneproducers.    "However, there are considerable indications that farmersare reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is notas good as that of other crops." REUTER&#3;
