Securities and Exchange CommissionChairman David Ruder said a brief trading halt has beendiscussed as one way of restoring order to the stock market,but stressed he is not recommending one at present.    Speaking to reporters, Ruder said he has been in frequentcontact with New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan aboutthe market's record drop today.    "I'm not afraid to say that there is some point, and Idon't know what that point is, that I would be quite anxious totalk to the New York Stock Exchange about a very temporary haltin trading," Ruder said.    Ruder, who spoke to reporters after addressing an AmericanStock Exchange-sponsored investors' conference here, said thatthe SEC does not have the legal authority to order a tradinghalt.    Any trading halt, which would probably last no more than ahalf-hour, would have to be approved by the stock exchanges,Ruder said. Reuter&#3;
