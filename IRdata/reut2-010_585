Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz wasquoted as saying Iran has attacked several ships withland-based missiles sited at the Strait of Hormuz.    The U.S. Announced recently Iran had emplaced Chinese-made"Silkworm" anti-ship missiles with the range to cover the entirewidth of the 24-mile-wide strait at the Gulf's mouth.    Aziz said in an interview with al-Thawra newspaper thatleaders of Gulf Arab states had told him of the existence ofthe missiles, which he said had been in place for many months.    "They briefed me with their details and we know that theIranians used them several times to attack ships belonging toArab states in the Gulf, sailing in the waterway," he said.    This is the first time any person of authority has saidIran, Iraq's enemy in the 6-1/2-year-old Gulf war, had firedthe missiles in anger.    A British naval source in the Gulf said last week Iran hadfired one test missile against a hulk in the strait.    About 120 ships have been attacked in the Gulf by bothbelligerents since January last year.    Aziz said the U.S. Had announced the existence of themissiles so late after their arrival as part of its efforts toneutralise the effects of the secret U.S. Arms sale to Iran.    "The missiles existed in the Gulf for many months ... Butthey became a serious topic for America and the West only afterthe failure of the Iranian invasion plan (against the southIraqi city of Basra) and as a balloon to cover up the Irangatestory," Aziz said.
