The U.S. Treasury proposed allowing temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uraniumoxide until July 1 under certain conditions pendingclarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress lastfall.    The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporaryimports because it felt Congress had not intended when itpassed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall-- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.    The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore andoxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert theirSouth African origin ore and oxide to other countries includingthe Soviet Union for processing.    The Treasury also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to beimported temporarily from South African state-controlledorganizations for repair or servicing in the U.S.    The South African sanctions law, enacted by the U.S. toprotest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced bySouth Africa's white minority government, prohibited imports ofuranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at theend of 1986.
