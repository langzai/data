The Pakistani government allowed theprivate sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policyannounced to cover the next three years.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free importof cotton yarn.    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton andrice along with the state corporations.    He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to makehigh quality yarn available to local ancillary industries andto enable them to compete effectively in the world market. Thiswould help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said. Reuter&#3;
