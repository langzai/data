Egypt is trying to persuade Arab statesand banks to buy its military debts to the United States andother Western countries so it can repay them on better terms,an Egyptian official said.

Egypt owes the U.S. 4.5 billion dlrs in military debt andhas failed to persuade Washington to reduce interest rates onit averaging about 14 pct.    Eqypt also owes France an undisclosed amount, estimated byArab diplomats at over two billion dlrs, and has not servicedthe debt for over a year. Other military debts are owed toSpain, West Germany and Britain.    The official said negotiations on the possibility of buyingthe debt have started, with approaches made to Kuwait and SaudiArabia, but no firm decisions have been reached.    The official also said the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and Egypt have agreed on certain economic reforms inreturn for emergency funds. An accord with the IMF would openthe way for Cairo to reschedule its 40 billion dlr debt.    The official said the IMF agreement requires Egypt to raiseenergy prices to international levels, unify its multi-tieredforeign exchange system and raise interest rates.    "Egypt will seek loans from various countries immediatelyafter the agreement with the IMF is signed," he said.    "If an Arab country buys part of the military debt or givesus guarantees, it will encourage banks to step in," he added. REUTER&#3;
