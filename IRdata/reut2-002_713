The House and Senate committeesinvestigating the Iran arms scandal said they would like toreview tapes of phone conversations between President Reaganand White House officials, if such tapes exist.    The committees were responding to a magazine articlethat quoted unidentified "sources with first-hand knowledge ofU.S. communications intelligence" as saying there is an archiveof recorded conversations among Reagan administrationofficials, including the president.    The article in Progressive magazine also said thegovernment had secretly monitored the home telephone of formerNational Security adviser Robert McFarlane after he had leftgovernment service in late 1985.    "According to sources with first hand knowledge of U.S.communications intelligence operations," the story said, "theMcFarlane intercept grew out of a program that has produced astill-undisclosed archive of recorded conversations involving... Reagan, Vice President George Bush, (fired NationalSecurity Council aide) Lt Col Oliver North, (former NationalSecurity Adviser) Adm John Poindexter, (former White HouseChief of Staff) Donald Regan and other key figures in theIran-contra arms scandal."    It said the monitoring was done for security and recordpurposes by the top-secret National Security Agency (NSA), andwas apparently done with the consent of those monitored.    But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied onepremise of the article, saying, "The National Security Agencysaid it did not monitor any of McFarlane's conversations."    He did not comment on the other recorded conversations theProgressive article said were included in the program.    "Clearly we would be interested in taking a look if indeedsuch tapes exist," a Senate Iran committee aide told Reuters inresponse to the magazine article.    A spokesman for the House Iran committee said the panelwould consider a request to the NSA for copies of thetelephone-tap archive described in the article.    Several legislators said the tapes, if it is confirmed thatthey exist, could prove invaluable to the special House andSenate committees that were created in January to investigateReagan's most damaging political crisis.    "This sort of evidence could be absolutely crucial ingetting to the bottom of the affair," said Rep. RobertKastenmeier, a Wisconsin Democrat and member of the HouseIntelligence Committee, told Reuters. Reuter&#3;
