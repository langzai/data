The House Ways and Means Committeecompleted action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws,chairman Dan Rostenkowski said.    The committee's consideration of one of the mostcontroversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surpluscountries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States,was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, itssponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was notcertain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposalwould take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries suchas Japan.    The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces PresidentReagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violateinternational trade agreements but it allows him to waveretaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.economy.    The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisionsto grant domestic industries import relief.    It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign tradepractices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. Thesepowers are currently held by President Reagan.    The administration has strongly objected to this transferof authority from Reagan to Yeutter.    The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiatemultilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped intoother trade legislation and voted on in the House in April. Reuter&#3;
