Australian trade unions said they havelaunched week-long strikes and other industrial action in NewSouth Wales (NSW) to protest against new laws that would reduceinjury compensation payments.    Union sources said talks with the state government brokedown last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet latertoday in an attempt to find a compromise.    Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country'smost populous state were the first to be affected, and unionofficials said almost every business sector will be hit unlessthere is a quick settlement.    The state government recently introduced a new workers'compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injuredworkers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentaryratification.    NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers'compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposedcuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year.    Union officials said industrial action could spread toother states as the federal government also plans to make sharpcuts in workers' compensation. REUTER&#3;
