Australia's Minister for TradeNegotiations is optimistic that progress is possible onreducing the large subsidies which the European Community andUnited States grant their farmers.    Michael Duffy said a European Commission scheme to reformthe EC Common Agricultural Policy and U.S. Plans to eliminatefarm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction.    "I am hopefully optimistic... There is goodwill inagricultural reform being shown by the USA, the EC and theCairns Group," he told reporters.    Duffy said the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural andcommodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a commonposition for forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) talks on farm subsidies.    The group, which includes Australia and Malaysia, advocatesfree farm trade and says U.S., European and Japanese subsidiesare stopping it competing in its traditional markets.    Duffy is on a two-day visit to Malaysia after talks inNorth and South America, the EC and Thailand, and leaves forIndonesia on Wednesday. REUTER&#3;
