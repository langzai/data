Strong growth in domestic demand was a keyfeature of the economies of southern European countries in1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.    In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's totaldomestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year tofive pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growthrestrained private consumption.    Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 anddomestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expectedto be halved to five pct next year.    In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,had been the driving force behind rapid growth in GrossDomestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumptionwere expected to ease during 1988 but would still remainstrong.    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharplynext year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the EuropeanCommunity and declining competitiveness.    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwardsfollowing an increase early this year linked with theintroduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices dueto cold weather. REUTER&#3;
