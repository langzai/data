The world's zinc mining and smeltingindustry will continue to become more concentrated and moreintegrated in the 1990s, Dr Klaus Goekmann, vice-president ofmarketing and sales for Cominco Ltd, said.    Opening a Metal Bulletin base metals conference here,Goekmann forecast the number of individual businesses in theindustry would continue to decline as companies merged orformed conglomerates with increased market shares.    At the same time, the conglomerates would become moreintegrated, handling the entire chain from basic ore productionthrough marketing, he added.    "The key to future viability will be flexibility. Prices arelikely to remain at current historically low levels at least inthe medium term, and competition with other metals andmaterials will continue to intensify," Goekmann said.    "In the past, we have only reacted to changes in the world'smarket and economics. In the future, we have to act lessdefensively and more aggressively."    The industry also has massive overcapacity and this problemhas to be tackled quickly, he added.    "Attempts in the past to cut out this excess capacity inEurope have all failed miserably. However, there is some hopethat current efforts may be successful," Goekmann said.    At the same time, companies must move to limit theirgeographical and currency risks and become far more marketingorientated, he added.    "With all these changes and rationalization, the industrycan survive to recover its past strength and profitability.Without them, the future does not look very rosy," Goekmannsaid. Reuter&#3;
