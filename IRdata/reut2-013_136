Network Control Corp said itintends to take a 250,000 dlr charge against earnings for thethird quarter ended March 31 and said sales for the quarterwould be about 400,000 dlrs, about 50 pct below sales in thesame year-ago quarter.    Network said it is taking the charge due to the significantincrease in accounts receivable which remain uncollected formore than 90 days after billing. It said it ultimately willcollect most of those accounts.    It attributed the sales decline to a transition period forits new products and a delay in a major order. Reuter&#3;
