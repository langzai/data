London's soft futures markets, namelycocoa, coffee and sugar, are adopting with immediate effect auniform presentation on their respective open positionsreferring to previous day's trading figures, a spokeswoman forthe London Commodity Exchange (LCE) said.    The figures represent total clients' long positions as wellas short positions, plus the net house positions as submittedby all members for each delivery month, she said.    As a result, figures will differ from those previouslypublished but are hoped to be more accurate and to compare morefavourably with other international markets, she added.    Since the introduction of a revised clearing procedure lastOctober, which incorporated a system of "mark-to-market',figures as published bore little relationship to the true openposition, the spokeswoman said.    The open position for business done up to the previoustrading day is prepared daily by the International CommodityClearing House (ICCH) and then posted on the various marketnotice boards. REUTER&#3;
