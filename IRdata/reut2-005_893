The National Association ofSecurities Dealers Inc said its board of governors has proposedadoption of uniform rules by major U.S. stock markets whichwould emphasize equal shareholder voting rights but allow forlegitimate variations.    The NASD said its proposal would eliminate differences instockholder voting standards as a competitive factor betweenmarkets. It called on the Securities and Exchange Commission toadopt such a rule applying to all markets if each equity marketis unwilling to voluntarily adopt a uniform rule under thecommission's guidence.    "Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to"voluntarily adopt a uniform rule such as it is proposing, NASDPresident Gordon S. Macklin said in a letter to SEC ChairmanJohn S.R. Shad.    The NASD said its view is based on the association's studyof the issue and from information developed at the SEC'srecently concluded hearings on the subject.    The current discussion of the one share-one vote issue wastriggered by the New York Stock Exchange's application to theSEC for permission to abandon the standard with respect tocompanies listed on the NYSE, the NASD noted.    It called for limiting variations of equal voting rights tosituations involving complete disclosure such as -     (1) shares in a registerd public offering where all factsconnected with the company's capital structure are clearlyspelled out in the prospectus and -     (2) shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisitionor recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompaniedby detailed proxy material.    The NASD said the uniform rule should be written todisallow the issuance of dual classes of shares where thosewith superior voting rights are not resalable. Reuter&#3;
