Japanese computer chip makers reactedangrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatoryaction against them for allegedly failing to live up to anagreement on trade in computer microchips.    Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) ChairmanShoichi Saba stated: "EIAJ believes that it is premature andeven irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of theagreement and our efforts to comply with it only six monthsafter concluding the agreement."    "We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider thedecision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japaneseefforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and toresist emotional biases," he said.    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation forwhat is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of thepact.    The agreement, struck late last year after months of heatednegotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chipson world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.    To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makersto slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateralorganisation designed to promote chip imports.    Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged threemln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation andexpressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.    "This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers maynot be really interested in participating in the Japanesemarket," he said. REUTER&#3;
