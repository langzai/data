President Reagan, fighting to recoverpolitically from the Iran-contra scandal, plans to acknowledgein a critical speech to the nation tonight he needs to changehis ways, administration officials said.    "It will be a forward-looking speech in which he will say heaccepts the need for change," said an official who asked not tobe identified. "I think the president wants to give his side ofthe story."    The official said Reagan would tell the public what he isdoing to set things right in the wake of last week's scorchingTower commission report on the origins of the scandal.    It is not clear whether Reagan will heed the advice of manyof his political allies and acknowledge that his Iran policywas wrong and he personally made some mistakes.    Asked at his daily news briefing if the president would sayhe erred, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater toldreporters, "His views are intensely personal and I won't giveyou any advance on what he intends to say in that area."    He said the speech would be 12 or 13 minutes in length andthat Reagan would "look beyond the horizon to a revitalizedWhite House that will pursue an active foreign policy."    "The president will discuss the Tower board report and itsrecommendations. He'll focus on changes he's making in thestructure of the NSC (National Security Council) and his goalsfor the next two years," the spokesman said.    To date, Reagan has defended his decision to sell arms toIran and conceded only there were errors in implementation.    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said tonight's speechmight be Reagan's last chance to repair his presidency.    "It's about the ninth inning ... he has to try and set us onanother course. It's hard to do that, he probably won't be ableto do it," Dole told reporters. Reuter&#3;
