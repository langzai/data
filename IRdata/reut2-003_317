a confidential world bank report on theperuvian economy said the government's strategy does not offergood prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely toquickly lead to inflation.    The report, published today by an economic monthly, theperu report, said the success of president alan garcia'sgovernment in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pctgross domestic product growth "represents gains in the shortterm at the expense of the long."    Government officials had no immediate comment on thereport, which advised a reduction in the overall size of thepublic investment programme and greater emphasis on thepreservation of peru's export potential.    The report said that although the government had succeededin cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 tounder 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme wasencountering increasing difficulties.    "an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked tomonetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing ofprice controls, appears not improbable," it added.&#3;
