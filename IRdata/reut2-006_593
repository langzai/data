The European Commission said it couldbegin legal moves within the next month against three majorairlines - Deutsche Lufthansa AG &lt;LHAG.F>, Alitalia Linee AereeItaliane Spa &lt;AZPI.MI> and &lt;Olympic Airways> - accusing them ofunfair fare-fixing and route sharing practices.    The Commission also announced a move designed to putpressure on EC ministers to agree by the end of June a new,more liberal, airline regime, which could bring lower fares anda greater choice of carriers for passengers.    The Commission has for years been pushing to force ECairlines to abandon arrangements under which they agree not tocompete against each other on price and share flights on routesbetween major cities on a 50-50 basis.    Last July, it wrote to 10 major airlines saying theirpractices breach EC competition rules and demandingundertakings that they would be revised or abolished.    The Commission said in a statement today seven airlineshave responded positively to these letters and negotiations aretaking place on how their practices might be modified. Reuter&#3;
