Britain intends to negotiate furtheragreements on international securities regulation to matchthose now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sourcessaid.    The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it hadconcluded a memorandum of understanding with Japan's FinanceMinistry to swap supervisory and investigatory information.    The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds,but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does notcome under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not coversome transactions on the London International Financial FuturesExchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges.    The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings withother countries which met in the U.K. Last December. Themeeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, theU.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germanyand Holland.    Government sources said the deal with Japan completesarrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K.Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) was signed last September.    Today's agreement will deal with requests for informationon a "case by case" basis, U.K. Government sources said. It isnot legally binding and comes into force immediately. REUTER&#3;
