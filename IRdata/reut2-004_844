The U.S. Has dropped its insistence thatthe floor price in a new International Natural RubberAgreement, INRA, be revised downward under certaincircumstances, conference sources said.    The surprise conciliatory move by the U.S. Meets one of theproducers' main concerns -- that the floor price, or "lowerindicative price," remain unchanged, they said.    It is not clear, however, whether all consuming countrieswill follow suit, as a number of them, in particular Britain,West Germany and Belgium, appeared to have strong reservations,the sources added.    The group of consumers has been seeking an adjustment ofthe "lower indicative price" (set at 150 Malaysian/Singaporecents a kilo in the present pact) if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.    The sources said the question of to what extent priceadjustments should be automatic remains a problem.    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has beenholding consultations with producers and consumers throughoutthe day.    The consumers' group is now holding a separate meetingahead of further consultations within the "president's group"tonight. Reuter&#3;
