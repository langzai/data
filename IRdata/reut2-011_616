The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.proposed for comment a rule setting minimum capitalrequirements for banks based on assessment of the risks oftheir assets.    The proposed rule, if adopted, would carry out aU.S.-British agreement announced in January for a uniformsystem to gauge the capital banks must maintain that accountsfor the riskiness of loans and other assets.    The regulatory agency's staff said at a meeting theproposal was in line with those of the Federal Reserve Boardand the Comptroller of the Currency.    The three U.S. agencies and the Bank of England agreed inearly January on the outlines of a uniform system for capitalstandards designed for the increasingly international bankingindustry that operates beyond national boundaries.    The FDIC, which regulates state-chartered banks, soughtpublic comment for 60 days, after which it will adopt a rule toconform with those of the Fed and the Comptroller.    The FDIC said the proposal rule redefines primary capital,assigns risk weights to assets not kept on a bank's balancesheet, and lays the groundwork for establishing a minimumrisk-based capital ratio.
