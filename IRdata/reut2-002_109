MCI Communications Corp PresidentBert Roberts said he expects MCI's financial performance toimprove in the current quarter compared to the previousquarter.    He said American Telephone and Telegraph Co long-distancerate cuts had cut into MCI's fourth quarter performance butadded: "There's going to be a continuing impact (on profits) butwe expect this quarter to be better than the fourth quarter."    The current quarter ends March 31.    For the fourth quarter, MCI reported a 448 mln dlr loss,due mainly to write-offs and staff reductions.    Roberts said the ATT long-distance rate reductions, whichhad been ordered by the Federal Communications Commission havehad "A significantly negative impact on our profits."    As reported earlier today, MCI said it plans to ask the FCCto immediately deregulate ATT, apparently in hopes that anunregulated ATT would pocket a greater proportion of itsrevenues rather than cut rates further.
