The two sides in the Rotterdam portgeneral cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independentchairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings,employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.    Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province ofFlevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up anagenda and procedures for meetings between the employers andunions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.    Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 inprotest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the4,000-strong workforce this year.    The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV onMarch 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunctionagainst the redundancies on procedural grounds.    The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 butZeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against theemployers and they were therefore very likely to restart thecomplicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.    Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreementin the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenanceworkers on strike, although loading was not affected, aspokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in thesector, said.    The employers have written to the union asking it toreconsider its position and a meeting of union members has beencalled for tomorrow. Reuter&#3;
