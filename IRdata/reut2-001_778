The Reagan administration officiallysubmitted to Congress its proposals to cut back U.S. farmers'income deficiency payments, decouple planting decisions fromincome support levels and accelerate reductions in loan rates,Senate staff said.    The recommendations, first outlined last January inPresident Reagan's fiscal 1988 budget blueprint, weretransmitted to both houses of Congress as legislativeproposals.    It was not clear which lawmakers might introduce themeasures.    The most controversial proposal in the package would make10 pct annual reductions in target prices for majorcommodities. A number of legislators have predicted the targetprice proposal will not move in Congress.    The package also would offer the so-called 0/92 option toproducers of 1987-90 crops and raise the annual permissiblereduction in loan rates to 10 pct from 5 pct.    Under 0/92, a producer is guaranteed at least 92 pct of hisdeficiency payment regardless of how much he plants. Reuter&#3;
