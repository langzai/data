Call money firmed to about 3.65 pct,back to yesterday's 3.60/70 pct, from around 3.55 pct earliertoday after the Bundesbank announced a tender for a newsecurities repurchase pact, dealers said.    The Bundesbank offered funds over 28 days at 3.80 pct,unchanged from the rate on recent facilities.    Many traders had expected the tender rate to come down inline with market rates for call money.    When this did not happen, because of more than adequateliquidity, many participants decided to withdraw funds from themarket and use them to build up minimum reserves further.    This resulted in the slight rise in call money.    Banks held 58.9 billion marks at the Bundesbank on April 5,averaging 59.3 billion over the first five days of the month,well clear of the likely 51 billion mark minimum reserverequirement, dealers said.    There was therefore some surprise that the Bundesbank wasoffering more funds above the call money rate.    But some dealers noted that the rate on the 28 day facilitywas in line with one month money, which traded at 3.80/85 todayafter 3.80/90 yesterday and 3.90/4.00 on April 1.    Given market liquidity dealers said banks were likely tobid, and the Bundesbank allocate, less than the 14.9 billionmarks draining from the market tomorrow when an earlier pactexpires.    One dealer expected some 10 billion marks to be allocated.    Some dealers said the Bundesbank would have been unwillingto cut rates on this pact, as it is the first under its fasterand more flexible tender process and because a lower rate mighthave been associated with the new system.    Dealers said they still thought the Bundesbank would overthe next month lower the call money range from the narrow3.6-3.8 and broad 3.5-4.0 pct it has held recently. REUTER&#3;
