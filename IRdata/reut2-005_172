Saudi Arabia's economy isshowing signs of picking up after problems last year caused bythe steep fall in oil prices, Commerce Minister SuleimanAbdulaziz al-Salim said.    Salim told a conference of Saudi businessmen the governmenthad taken a bold step to stimulate the economy by drawing downmore than 50 billion riyals of reserves in its 1987 budget.    Salim said one tangible sign of that optimism had been astrong rise in the price of Saudi shares. Some have gained bymore than 35 pct since last November.    But the keynote speaker, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, accusedSaudi businessmen of ingratitude because they preferred toinvest abroad rather than in Saudi Arabia.    The need to increase private investment in Saudi Arabia isexpected to be a major theme of the conference.    Saudi Arabia's economic planners have long recognised theneed to stimulate the private sector and diversify theoil-dependent economy.    But despite the encouraging signals cited by Salim, somebusinessmen and bankers said they are still sceptical aboutprospects for the economy. REUTER&#3;
