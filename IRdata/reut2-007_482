Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidJapan plans to announce a package of economic measuresimmediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament.    The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 asthe government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budgetfor the year starting April 1. An opposition boycott over aproposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business.    Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington.    Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April orearly May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June.    Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetaryconferences including International Monetary Fund meetings inearly April, Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully onthe matter, taking into account parliament debate.    The package is likely to include a record amount of publicworks spending in the first 1987/88 half, Miyazawa said.    Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8,800billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1,800 billionfor public works. Japan expects the stop-gap budget to helpspur the economy, Miyazawa said.    Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related tothe controversial sales tax without any revision.    Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarksby a top government official as indicating a revision of thetax but the official did not mean that, Miyazawa said. REUTER&#3;
