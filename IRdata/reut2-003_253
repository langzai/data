The London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,will cease trading in its deliverable pigmeat contract fromApril 3, the LMFE said.    The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on thecash settled contracts introduced last year.    "This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate ourmarketing on the pig and live cattle contracts," LMFE officialPeter Freeman said. "These two have already shown theireffectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts isincreasing," he added.    "Using the futures market allows better planning and forwardprice fixing that our industry needs," chairman Pat Elmer said.    Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat andLivestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February,which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twicethe number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said.    Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts wasintroduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of thefutures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat wouldincrease because of the absence of a delivery requirement.
