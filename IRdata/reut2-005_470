U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said the United States will retaliate if the EuropeanCommunity adopts a proposed tax on vegetable oils, but he didnot say what EC products would be singled-out for reprisal.    Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA)convention here, Yeutter said he is "cautiously optimistic" thecontroversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the ECCouncil of Ministers.    Yeutter said the proposed tax is a "flagrant violation ofthe spirit of GATT" because it would imperil the zero bindingduty on U.S. exports of soybeans to Europe.    He said the Reagan administration has yet to decide on aretaliation list. The administration would not reveal aretaliation list unless the EC approved the proposal, he said. Reuter&#3;
