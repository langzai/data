The two largest U.K. Building societies,the Halifax and Abbey National, said they have joined thebanks' centralised clearing system.    The move is intended to cut the current four or five days'delay in clearing credits and attract the direct payment ofcustomers' salaries into building societies rather than intobanks, spokesmen for the two societies said.    It is the first time non-banking organisations have enteredthe clearing system and emphasises the growing competitionbetween building societies and banks, industry sources said.    The two societies yesterday joined the Bankers' AutomatedClearing Services (BACS) which settles small, automatedpayments and the Association of Payment Clearing Systems(APACS) which sets policy for Britain's payment systems.    The Halifax had previously settled small payments throughBarclays bank and Abbey National through Lloyds bank, thespokesmen said. REUTER&#3;
