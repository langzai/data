The dollar closed virtually unchangedfrom yesterday's finish, but near the day's high after anotherextremely quiet session.    With the G-5 meeting in Washington ahead of this week's IMFinterim committee, traders remained reluctant to open any largepositions. Towards the end of the day the dollar firmed afterfailing earlier to hold beneath 1.82 marks. Some dealers saidSenate testimony from Fed Chairman Paul Volcker also lentsupport.    The dollar closed at 1.8265/75 marks after opening at1.8200/15 and closing yesterday at 1.8260/70.    Volcker said that a further sizeable dollar decline couldbe counter-productive, and that exchange rate adjustments havebeen enough to narrow the U.S. Trade deficit.    Such remarks in the past might have moved the dollarsharply, today they only pushed it up 20 or 30 basis pointswhen it was already firming for technical reasons.    The dollar in any case held in a narrow range today,trading early in the morning just below 1.82 marks and risingto a high of 1.8270.    Dealers said they were awaiting comments after the G-5meeting from U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.    Looking slightly further ahead, the market is awaiting U.S.February trade data, due on April 14.    Another set of disappointing figures could push the dollarbelow its recent 1.80-85 mark range if there have been nosupportive statements from G-5 officials in Washington in themeantime, dealers said.    Sterling closed slightly easier at 2.950/954 marks, afteropening at 2.951/955 and closing yesterday at 2.954/958.    The pound has been buoyed by expectations the rulingConservatives will win the next U.K. Election.    But dealers said sterling now looks high against the markand room for further gains must be limited.    Many dealers believe sterling will enter the EMS jointfloat after a U.K. Election. In this case, its ceiling couldwell be at or near 2.95 marks, dealers said.    The yen closed at 1.2550/70 marks per 100 after closingyesterday at 1.2490/2510, and the Swiss franc firmed to120.55/70 marks per 100 from 120.10/50.    The French franc ended unchanged at 30.04/07 marks per 100. REUTER&#3;
