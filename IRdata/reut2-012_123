Drilling of this year's British sugarbeet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weatherconditions with only around one pct sown so far, a spokesmanfor British Sugar Plc said.    This compares with two pct at the same stage last year,three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984.    There is little cause for concern with better weatherforecast and the capacity available to drill the contractedarea of around 200,000 hectares in about 10 days. Seed bedslook good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperaturesto rise, the spokesman said.    "If the crop can be drilled by the third week in April wewill be delighted," he said. Last year a large proportion of thecrop was not drilled until May but it still turned out to bethe equal second largest on record. Reuter&#3;
