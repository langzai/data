Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volcker said the suspension by Brazil of itsforeign debt payments would not undermine U.S. Banks.    But he told Reuters after a speech to educators that it wasin the interest of U.S. Banks to complete debt financing planssoon with Brazil and other debtor nations.    "I don't think it's going to undermine public confidence inthe banking system from Brazil alone," he said. "But I would liketo see further progress made on this whole situation."    Brazil announced last month it was temporarily suspendinginterest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt owed to privatebanks, opening a new round in the five-year-old debt crisis.    Last week, Ecuador suspended interest payments to privateforeign banks, which hold about two-thirds of its total 8.3billion dlr foreign debt, citing severe damage to its oilindustry caused by an earthquake.    Citicorp &lt;CCI> the largest U.S. Bank, said last week thatit might have to reclassify most of its 4.6 billion dlrs inBrazilian loans as non-performing, thus removing them as partof the bank's expected income-producing assets.    Analysts said such a move would sharply reduce Citicorp'sprofits and might result in similar measures by Brazil's otherbank creditors.    Volcker said he believed Brazil and Ecuador want tomaintain continuity in their debt service.    "It's fundamentally in their best interest. If they can getthe financing and refinancing that's necessary, they may beable to make their economies grow again."    Asked whether he expected other nations to follow the pathtaken by Brazil and Ecuador, he said the two countries werespecial cases. He did not elaborate. REUTER&#3;
