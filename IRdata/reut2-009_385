Unisys Corp vice chairman JosephKroger said the company's new series 1100 mainframe computerproducts will not be available for at least a year.    At a press conference introducing new products in the V500computer series, Kroger said Unisys's new Super 90 and Mercurycomputers will not be available until after March 1988. Theproducts are being developed for addition to the 1100 series.    No specific time frame had been set for introduction of theSuper 90, which will be based on the existing 1190 mainframe,or the Mercury, which will be a new computer, a Unisysspokesman said.    "There is a lot of pent-up customer demand for theproducts," Kroger told Reuters. But Unisys has not lost anycustomers currently using its 1190 mainframes because of thewait for the new products, he said.    At the press conference, Kroger said Unisys is notdeveloping a one-megabit computer memory chip but will probablybuy them when appropriate from Japanese suppliers.     Inresponse to a question, Kroger indicated first quarter ordersshould be up from a year ago, with international business goodand the U.S. market still "difficult." Reuter&#3;
