Debt talks between the Philippinegovernment and its bank advisory committee were delicatelypoised after a brief meeting between the two sides today,bankers and sources close to the Philippine delegation said.    "We had a businesslike meeting and made good progress," abanker said. "The banks are anxious to come to an agreement."    But bankers were reluctant to predict whether the talkswould end successfully. Caution was also evident in thePhilippine camp. "We feel the ball's in the banks' court," onesource said. The two sides will meet again on Friday.    The talks, in which the Philippines is seeking toreschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt, are now dominatedby a discussion of the innovative proposal made by financeminister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interestbill in Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, instead of cash.    Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate incash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR.    The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday,but Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which soughtto satisfy the banks' objections by guaranteeing that the noteswould yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash.        The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on thenew proposal.    Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warmsupport for the PINs proposal this week, which gave Ongpin hopethat the banks would embrace the idea.    But the banks are still being circumspect, weighingpossible accounting consequences as well as considering theprecedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS.    One of the  main architects of the PINs proposal, U.S.lawyer Lee Buchheit, is adamant that the banks have nothing toworry about.    "To the extent that it's a precedent, it's a precedent tobe encouraged," Buchheit, a partner with Cleary, Gottlieb,Steen and Hamilton, told a debt-equity swaps conferencesponsored by Euromoney magazine.    Under the proposal, banks would sell the dollar-denominatedPINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convertthem into pesos at face value to fund government-approvedequity investments in the Philippines.    In effect, international firms would be paying part ofManila's interest bill, allowing the government to conservemuch-needed hard currency.    One of the beauties of the scheme, according to Buchheit,is that it widens the scope of third-world debt negotiations,which have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past4-1/2 years.    "There's another pool of cash at the table now," he said.    David Mulford, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury,told the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should bepart of a "menu" of options available to banks instead of purenew-money packages.    He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billiondlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged.    "We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devisingnew money packages may, in effect, be essential to future banksyndications," Mulford said.    In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal, hesaid that dissatisfaction with Mexico's economic program andcriticism of communication and coordination within the banksyndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse toparticipate in the loan.    This refusal "for a time appeared to jeopardize theprospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks,"Mulford said.    The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20,but bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe newlife into the financing process, especially with crucialnegotiations with Brazil, about to start.    The banks for their part insist that they are more thanwilling to discuss Mulford's "menu", and say it is the debtorsthat need to be more flexible. For example, they say financingtalks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Airesdislikes the debt-equity schemes and onlending provisions thatthe banks are promoting. But whether the banks are ready toendorse the PINs concept right away still hangs in the balance. Reuter&#3;
