Thailand will this week seekclarification from the U.S. About its decision to freeze riceexport prices from January to early April, Commerce MinisterMontri Pongpanich said.    Montri told reporters he will seek a meeting with U.S.Ambassador William Brown to determine why the U.S. Failed toset its weekly rice prices in accordance with rising worldprices during the period.    He said the U.S. Has followed a policy of weakening worldrice prices by announcing highly subsidised export prices lowerthan those quoted by Thai traders.    Thai officials said weekly rice prices as announced by theU.S. Agriculture Department were unchanged for 11 weeks up toApril 8.    Thailand, a major rice exporter, has criticised the U.S.Farm Act which provides heavy subsidies to U.S. Exportersenabling them to compete with Thai exporters.    Thai officials said average export prices of Thai rice fell19 pct last year and another 5.8 pct during the first quarterthis year.    The Board of Trade said Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnesin January/March, down from 1.29 mln a year ago.    It said the export decline was partly due to the reluctanceof Thai traders to accept all foreign orders as world pricesdid not rise in line with firming domestic prices.    The board said, however, that Thailand may export more ricelater this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East andAsia, due to lower production in many drought affected Africancountries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burmaand Pakistan.    It said Thai rice exports to nine major African buyers roseto 351,889 tonnes during the first quarter from 93,038 a yearearlier. REUTER&#3;
