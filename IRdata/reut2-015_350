Remarks by two leading central bankerssparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut inthe West German three pct discount rate may be underdiscussion, currency dealers said.    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech thatmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflowsrequired cuts in interest rates.    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president DieterHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall belowits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he wasnot making a forecast on interest rates, however.    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollargained slight background support from the speculation.    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the moneymarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may eitheroffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rateand let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much lessthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pactexpired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank couldmove to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculativecapital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless ofwhether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity."    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of thegenerally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked thefirst time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as acounterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.REUTER^M&#3;
