Stanley Simon was charged withextorting 50,000 dlrs from a defense contractor in the firstindictment in a corruption probe involving two Congressmen, aformer aide to President Reagan and other government officials.    Simon, who resigned last month as Bronx Borough President,was accused of extorting the money and forcing the now bankruptcontractor, the Wedtech Corp., to hire his brother-in-law andthen give him raises.    Simon is also accused of perjury and forcing one of hisemployees to pay him 14,000 dlrs in salary kickbacks.    He is the first public official to be indicted fordemanding money from Wedtech, a minority-owned company thatbuilds pontoon bridges for the Defense Department.    "Wedtech was one of the success stories in the Bronx, butthe company was manipulated and raped," Thomas Scheer, the headof the FBI's New York office, said of the payoffs the companyallegedly made to win contracts.    Wedtech executives have said they paid bribes to about 20government officials.    Law enforcement sources say two Bronx congressmen, MarioBiaggi and Robert Garcia, are under investigation.    A special federal prosecutor has been appointed todetermine whether former Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger actedimproperly when he became a Wedtech consultant four monthsafter leaving the White House.    Nofziger was given up to 1 mln dlrs in Wedtech stock. Reuter&#3;
