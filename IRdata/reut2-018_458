The New Zealand government isforecasting a budget surplus of 379 mln N.Z. Dlrs for the yearending March 1988, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said in astatement.    This compares with a deficit of 1.95 billion dlrs in theyear ending March 1987 and a 1.87 billion dlr deficit a yearearlier.    Total expenditure is seen at 22.907 billion dlrs against20.94 billion in the year to end-March 1987. Total revenue isseen at 23.29 billion dlrs against 18.992 billion.    The forecast rise in revenue comes partly from the 10 pctvalue added goods and services Tax (GST) introduced in October1986 which is seen bringing in 4.1 billion dlrs against 1.23billion a year earlier.    Other indirect taxation is seen rising to 3.1 billion dlrsfrom 2.2 billion. Company tax is forecast to bring in 2.39billion dlrs against 1.22 billion a year earlier while the taxtake from individuals is seen little changed at 10.7 billiondlrs against 10.9 billion.    Excluding revenue and expenditure of a capital nature, suchas repayment of loans by state-owned enterprises or revenuefrom asset sales, the budget would indicate a deficit of 1.27billion dlrs, Douglas said    Using this "financial deficit" method the deficit in the yearto end March 1987 was 1.89 billion dlrs, he said.    Douglas said using this method, the financial deficitforecast for 1987/88 measures 2.2 pct of gross domestic productagainst 6.9 pct a year earlier. REUTER&#3;
