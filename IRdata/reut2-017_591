Norway is expected to seek a compromisesolution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats OljeselskapA/S &lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firmwill operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.    The sources, who asked not to be named, said the governmentwill likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as thefield's operator through the development phase, with Statoiltaking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.    Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government hadtoday discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decisionhad been taken and several questions remained unresolved.    It was unlikely the government would announce its decisionon Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meetingand after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,the sources added.    This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoilexercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration licensethat, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieveConoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised byConoco.    Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry asthe most likely candidate for the first field developmentproject on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off centralNorway. Reuter&#3;
