Officials of the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission (CFTC) said merging the agency with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would not helpregulation of commodities and securities markets.    "I don't think that a merger would solve regulatoryproblems," CFTC chairman Susan Phillips told the HouseSubcommittee on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.    "I think what does solve our problems would be working withother agencies in a strong capacity," she said in response to aquestion. "We don't want agencies to trample on ourjurisdiction either."    CFTC Commissioner Fowler West said, "We ... do not have theexpertise to regulate securities markets. I don't think the SEChas the expertise to regulate the futures markets."    Increased attention to price volatility in stock indexfutures markets and reports of alleged futures trading abuseshave raised concerns Congress may adopt a radically differentregulatory structure for securities and futures markets.    Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energyand Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over securitiesregulation, has said he will hold hearings on the questions ofmarket volatility and alleged trading abuses.
