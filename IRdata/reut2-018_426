The West German government today considereddemands for nearly 850 mln marks to lay off or retrain 20,000steel workers.    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor HelmutKohl reviewed a joint proposal by steel employers and tradeunions at a special meeting with steel industryrepresentatives.    Companies like Fried Krupp &lt;KRPG.D> and Hoesch Werke AG&lt;HWKG.F>, which saw profits plunge last year, have taken theunusual step of aligning with the metalworkers' trade union, IGMetall, to press for government finance to slim staff levelsstill further.    Government officials said Bonn was prepared to take part ina common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. Butsince the government was struggling to finance tax cuts byreducing state subsidies, it could not pay for all the layoffs.    A spokesman for IG Metall said the joint proposal foresawredundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhinelandplants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steelmaking sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 wouldbe eligible for job-retraining schemes. Redundancies areestimated at 600 mln marks, while job retraining would cost afurther 240 mln. REUTER&#3;
