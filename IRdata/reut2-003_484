Westpac Banking Corp and theMelbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and SocialResearch said their leading index of Australian economicactivity rose for the ninth successive month in December.    The index rose to 134.1 (base 1980) from 129.8 in Novemberand 122.8 a year earlier, the Westpac-Institute report said.    Annualised, it rose 13 pct in December against seven pct inNovember and one pct a year earlier, based on the ratio of thelatest index to the average over the previous 12 months.    The report said the index is now 12 points or 9.8 pct aboveits trough in March 1986.    Westpac's chief economist Bob Graham said the consistentupward trend in the leading index emphasised the need for atough mini-budget in May. "An untoward increase in consumptionspending before the balance of payments improves would havedisastrous consequences," he said.    The coincident index also rose an annualised three pct inDecember against zero movement in November and a seven pct risea year earlier, Westpac and the Institute said.    They said this index continued to show the currentrecession is shallow and is more likely to involve a slowing inreal growth than an absolute fall in economic activity. REUTER&#3;
