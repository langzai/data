The Swiss Banking Commission hopes tointroduce a major reform of the banking system in January whichwould revolutionise the workings of the country's unusualliquidity requirements.    Commission Director Kurt Hauri told Reuters the mainconsequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise ininterest rates which occurs at the end of every month.    By effectively reducing liquidity requirements, it wouldalso help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain,West Germany and the United States, he said.    The commission wants to move to a system of averageliquidity requirements, where banks have to hold reservesequivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculatedover the month as a whole.    The current system, described  as a Swiss special case byHauri, forces banks to comply with requirements generally onlyat the end of each month.    The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated moneymarket rates, overshadowed by the approach of the end-month,called the ultimo, with consequent high costs for the banks whoare forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank.    This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 whenovernight rates hit triple figures, due to a combination of thehalf-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to itsmoney supply target. Although the rise shocked the bank intomore flexibility, the problem remained.    The reform proposal, which Hauri said had been planned foryears, was given to banks and other interested parties forcomment on September 30.    They have until the end of this month to suggestalterations. Subject to such changes, and to the governmentgo-ahead, it will come into force on January 1, Hauri said. REUTER&#3;
