Oil prices would skyrocket for a time ifconflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oilsupplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.    He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Militaryaction in the Gulf.    But in an address to a conference of the IndonesianPetroleum Association, he said, "If worst comes to worst and saythe flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completelyshut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,can take care of the situation."    "But this is not to say that prices, at least for a shortduration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage ofthe situation," he declared.    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relativelyshort-term impact on prices, he added.    Assessing future price trends, he said, "Short-term spotprices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likelyhover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs perbarrel.    "The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greaterthan the downward ones."    "The balance between supply and demand in the short termwill still be delicate," he added. "Non-Opec production may stillgo up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increasein world demand."    Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee whichhas been touring cartel members, said speculation may playhavoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize thesituation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.    In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach aplateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, hesaid. REUTER&#3;
