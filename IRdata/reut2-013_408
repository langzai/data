The Danish government said it plannedtax changes to discourage people making shopping trips to WestGermany and other countries where consumer durables arecheaper.    Tax Minister Isi Foighel told journalists the governmentwill present a bill abolishing sales tax - generally 10 to 20pct - on radios, record players, loudspeakers, video tapes,vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens and small household items.    The annual loss in revenue of 275 mln Danish crowns will bemade up by higher duties on four-wheel drive vehicles and smallpick-up vans, which will be taxed in future as commercialvehicles under two tonnes.    Foighel also announced small reductions in the concessionsfor duty-free imports to compensate for a strengthening of theDanish crown.    He said maximum concessions would apply in future only totravellers out of the country for more than 24 hours. Thosereturning within that period will have to prove to customs thatthey have been on more than a shopping trip.    The tax move follows an official report showing that totalborder imports, about three billion crowns in 1985, rose bysome 600 mln crowns in 1986, a trend which has alarmed Danishbusinesses, particularly in Jutland areas bordering Germany.
