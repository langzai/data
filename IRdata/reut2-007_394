First Interstate Bancorp said its1987 pre-tax income could be reduced by about 33.5 mln dlrs ifit decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium- tolong-term loans to Brazil as nonperforming.    But the company stressed in a filing with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon toreclassify the debt, despite Brazil's Feb 20 suspension ofdirect interest payments on medium- and long-term loans.    "The corporation believes that it is premature to make adecsion to classify such medium- and long-term debt asnonperforming at this time," First Interstate said.    But First Interstate said that if Brazil's suspension ofinterest payments continues, it may have to reclassify itsloans as nonperforming and place them on non-accrual, meaningthat interest previously accrued but not paid would be deductedfrom net income and interest would no longer be accrued.    Besides its medium- and long-term debt, First Interstatesaid it also has 165 mln dlrs in short-term loans or tradelines in Brazil.    As of Dec 31, 1986, nonperforming Brazilian outstandingswere about 4.1 mln dlrs, it said. Reuter&#3;
