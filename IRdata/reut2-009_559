U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he believes proposed legislation calling formandatory acreage reductions has little support in Congress andvoiced Reagan administration opposition to it.    "The administration would be very much opposed to thatlegislation," he told a Virginia Farm Bureau lunch.    "But fortunately I don't detect a strong interest in thatlegislation." He added, "I doubt there will be (enough) supportto get it out."    The controversial bill, supported by Representative RichardGephardt, a Missouri Democrat, calls for a national referendumto be conducted that could result in mandatory unpaid acreagecuts of up to 35 pct, paid land diversion beyond that level ifnecessary and a marketing quota.
