The prospects of theInternational Coffee Organization (ICO) reaching an agreementon coffee export quotas before September appear dim, AlbertoHesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation,said.    "There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go toquotas," Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministryon coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name thedelegations.    A special meeting between importing and exporting countriesended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talksover how to set quotas.    The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1but the full council is not due to meet again until September."I am not optimistic about an agreement soon," Hesse said. Reuter&#3;
