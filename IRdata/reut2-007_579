Ohio Edison Co said it hascompleted the sale and leaseback of 30 pct of its 30 pctinterest in Unit One of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant,receiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest.    The utility said the share of its interest in the 1,205megawatt generating plant was sold to a group of institutionalinvestors which leased it back to the company for a period ofabout 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate.    Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance therest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loansincurred for the retirement of high-interest long-term debt.    Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments, but it saidthe "payments will reduce the amount of revenue the companywill need to cover our investment in Perry, which translatesinto savings for our customers."    The utility said it projects the financing could reduce theamount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It planson filing a rate application with the Public UtilitiesCommission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year.    It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to theinvestors because they could take quicker advantage of taxbenefits than the utility could. Reuter&#3;
