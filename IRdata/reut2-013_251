Philippine coffee exports are expectedto fall sharply due to a combination of the InternationalCoffee Organisation's (ICO) decision not to revive exportquotas and higher local prices, ICO Certifying Agency officialDante de Guzman told Reuters.    He said exporter registrations dropped from an averageweekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exportsin coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to totalabout 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86.     "Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices,it has become difficult to service exports," de Guzman said,adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.    Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to aboutone mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending Junefrom 1.1 mln bags last year, he said. REUTER&#3;
