Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoawill continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports areforecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as thegovernment tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.    The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agricultureforecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bagsproduced in 1985/86.

The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mlntonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on afall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction ofquotas by the International Coffee Organisation.    Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadilyas the government develops cocoa plantations. Production ofcocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the governmentto rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.    Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.    The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnesthis year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.    The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer ofIndonesian cocoa beans.    The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC(crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increasesignificantly with the coming on stream of at least eight newCTC processing plants.    Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producingmore CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.    Production of black and green teas is forecast in theembassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from123,000 tonnes in 1986.    Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnesin 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.
