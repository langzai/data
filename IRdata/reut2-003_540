Senators and a special prosecutorwere in dispute today over a legal maneuver to force quickanswers from key figures in the Iran arms scandal and thediversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels.    Senators on a special Senate committee investigating thescandal want to grant limited immunity from prosecution toforce early testimony from Lt. Col. Oliver North and JohnPoindexter.    North is the National Security Council (NSC) aide PresidentReagan fired November 25 for possibly illegal diversion of Iranarms payments to the so-called contra rebels. Poindexter, whowas NSC director and North's boss, resigned the same day.     The Washington Post said over the weekend that Poindexterwas ready to testify that he told Reagan twice of the fundsdiversion, contrary to Reagan's denial that he knew of it.    Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said he asked a specialHouse committee yesterday to delay limited immunity for Northand Poindexter for at least 90 days, and would make the samerequest to the Senate committee today.    Walsh said he was also urging the committees to delaygranting immunity for a third key figure, retired Air ForceMaj. Gen. Richard Secord, a close North associate.    Walsh, whose job is to determine whether anyone should beprosecuted for criminal misconduct, said premature immunitycould put the three beyond the law before a grand jury candecide whether they should be prosecuted.
