E.F. Hutton LBO Inc is still interestedin an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp, and is examiningthe possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer, an E.F.Hutton spokesman said.    Hutton's offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer fromEmery Air Freight Corp &lt;EAF> earlier this week.    "We're definately not out of it at this point," the Huttonspokesman said.    "We want to see what the offer is completely and understandit fully, and then fashion our response," the spokesman said.    After Emery made its offer, Hutton extended the deadline onits offer to Monday. The offer was to have expired Wednesday.    Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise theoffer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easiertime justifying a lofty price since it would realize costsavings by combining its business with those of Purolator.    Purolator, a New Jersey-based overnight courier, hasdeclined comment.    Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price onspeculation a new bidder would emerge. It was up 1/8 today at40-3/8, above the Emery offer. Reuter&#3;
