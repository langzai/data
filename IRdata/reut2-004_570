Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawkecalled on businessmen to hold their salaries and profit marginsas part of his campaign for economic restraint.    In a speech to the National Press Club, Hawke said business"must not puncture the spirit of community restraint" evident inlow wage increases and suppressed consumer demand.    Hawke said the Federal Government would coordinate withState administrations to monitor prices and profit margins.    "At a time when a concerted national effort to restraincosts is required, profit margins should not be increased," hesaid.    Direct price control did not appeal to the government, butit would act to ensure market forces operated fairly andbusinesses were reminded of their obligations to Australia,Hawke said.    The government would demonstrate its commitment withspending cuts in its May 14 economic statement, he said.    It would also limit increases in government excisesnormally indexed to inflation to about six pct, Hawke said. REUTER&#3;
