The U.S. Has been promised a nearmonopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countriesguaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, anEC official said.    The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters thatthe guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of theagreement.    Under the accord, which began in January, third countrieswere guaranteed access for the next four years for two mlntonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as300,000 tonnes of sorghum.    However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured thatalmost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.    The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either atender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or toauthorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.    EC sources noted that under a tender system maize fromoutside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourableterms than that from the U.S.    No Commission spokesman was immediately available forcomment.
