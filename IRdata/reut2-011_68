Sharp cutbacks in drilling in Oklahomaand Kansas pushed the U.S. drilling rig count down by 36 to atotal of 748, against 1,034 working rigs one year ago, HughesTool Co said.    The latest weekly count of rig activity reversed lastweek's gain of 23 rigs for a total of 784, which had been thefirst improvement in the drilling rig count this year.    "I have no explanation for the decline," said Hugheseconomist Ike Kerridge. "I think we're near the bottom of thisyear's rig count but the wet ground in northern andmidcontinent states could affect the count in the next fewweeks."    Among individual states, Oklahoma and Kansas reporteddeclines of 16 and 11 working rigs last week. Texas lost sevenand Michigan and Wyoming were each down by three rigs. Gainswere reported in Louisiana and California, which increased byseven and six, respectively.    In Canada, the rig count dropped by 52 to a total of 131working rigs, against 222 one year ago. Kerridge attributed thesteep drop to the government's annual springtime ban againstrigs and other heavy equipment being transported overrain-softened highways. Reuter&#3;
