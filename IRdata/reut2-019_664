Intel Corp said it has signed aletter of intent with privately-held Silicon Compiler SystemsCorp under which Intel will become a value-added silicon vendorfor integrated circuits designed with Silicon Compiler'sGENESIL silicon compilation system.    Under the proposed pact, Intel would provide initialsilicon foundry services for GENESIL-based designs.    GENESIL users would be able to compile theirapplication-specific designs using Intel's 1.5-microncomplementary metal-oxide semiconductor process.    Reuter&#3;
