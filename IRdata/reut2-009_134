The Ferruzzi Group's holding companyAgricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the Europeancorn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under theagreement reached in principle between the two companies, astatement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.    When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, itsaid only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.    Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on severalclauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.    It said the deal would involve 13 starch factoriesemploying about 5,000 people in eight European Communitycountries plus facilities and commercial operations in other ECstates.    The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, orabout one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes ofcereals.    Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extendits presence in the European agro-industrial industry bothgeographically and in terms of products.    It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugarand of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.    It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximumquotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and saidit foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch inthe future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.    Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said thepresent management of the CPC milling business will be asked toremain in their posts. REUTER&#3;
