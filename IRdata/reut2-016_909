British Foreign Secretary Sir GeoffreyHowe called on industrial and developing countries to combattrade protectionism and remove barriers which impede freetrading in agricultural products.    Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N.Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the currentUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    He said Britain is committed to resisting and combattingprotectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services.    Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets,remove measures distorting free trade in services and provideprotection for intellectual property rights.    He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economicpolicies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stablecurrency relationships.    Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surplusesand falling commodity prices in recent years, is oversubsidised and over protected. But the problem of farmsurpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it ispolitically difficult for any government to reverse the trendof growing farm subsidies.    "This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection ofagriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need thesustained application of all our energy and our imagination tofind solutions," Howe said.
