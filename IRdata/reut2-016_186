Two Utah financial institutions, theBank of Iron County and Summit Savings and Loan Association,have failed, official spokesmen said.    The board of directors of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (FDIC) has approved the assumption of the depositliabilities of Bank of Iron County, Parowan, Utah, by DixieState Bank, St George, Utah, an FDIC spokesman said.    The bank, which had total assets of 20.1 mln dlrs, was thefirst bank in Utah to fail this year and the 59th nationwide.    Its three offices will reopen today as branches of DixieState Bank and its depositors will automatically becomedepositors of the assuming bank.    Dixie State Bank will assume about 19.9 mln dlrs in 6,300deposit accounts and will purchase all of the failed bank'sassets at a discount of 3.575 mln dlrs.    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed Summit Savings andLoan Association, Park City, Utah, and directed the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to transfer anestimated 116.9 mln dlrs in insured deposits to United Savingsand Loan Association, Ogden, Utah, an FSLIC spokesman said.    Summit, a 120.8 mln dlr institution, was insolvent, thespokesman said. The bank board appointed the FSLIC asconservator for the association on April 14, 1986.    Summit has since operated as part of the bank board'sManagement Consignment Program. United Savings has 205 mln dlrsin assets and nine offices in Utah, and one in Idaho. REUTER&#3;
