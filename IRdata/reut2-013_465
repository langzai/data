LME zinc was quiet throughout the morningwith very little dealing after some light trade selling on thepre-market, dealers said.    Three months delivery ended official ring dealings quotedat 454.50/455 stg a tonne, down around two stg from yesterdayafternoon's kerb close.    The pre-market dollar based trade selling pushed threemonths down to a 730 dlrs equivalent but attracted no followthrough selling and the price held at that level for the restof the morning.
