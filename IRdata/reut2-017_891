Japan is disappointed at the recent threatsof trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just asthe trade situation between the two is improving, JapaneseTrade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.    "I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take aharsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement," hesaid in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a newcentre designed to improve understanding between the two sides.    Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed toimpose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electricalgoods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports.    Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of ECmanufactured goods in the year ended March 31.    "I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance throughexpansion."    "While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficitbetween Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified notby reducing trade through import restrictions or exportrestraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade," Tamura said.
