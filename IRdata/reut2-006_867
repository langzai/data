Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87)is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikowin its monthly sugar market review.    Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year'sdomestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for exportof which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will betaken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries andthe remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.    Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln importsfrom Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and exportneeds of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes tobe acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date maynot be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said. Reuter&#3;
