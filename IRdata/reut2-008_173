The solution of the world's debtcrisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence ofprotectionism is the biggest danger, the president of theFederal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.    Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of DresdnerBank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil'ssuspension last month of part of its interest payments wouldlead to a chain reaction in Latin America.    It is important to increase the efficiency of debtorcountries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency fromexports to repay foreign debt, he said.    Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, butBrazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help ofappropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bringback financial stability to that country.    Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be takennow. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able torepay debts in the short run, even if economic conditionsimproved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthenthe economic position of these countries, to ensure worldeconomic growth so they are able to sell their products atadequate prices.    Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved incoordination with governments, international organisations suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, andcreditor banks.    "This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banksalone," he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standingof debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raisefunds on international credit markets again. He said a wholeset of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced theinternational banking system would provide more funds, but theproblem is not just economic but also political. REUTER&#3;
