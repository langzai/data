Turkey, which tomorrow will formallyapply to join the European Community, faces major obstacles inits bid and is unlikely to become the bloc's 13th member beforethe year 2,000, EC officials said.    Turkey's move comes as no surprise, but some officials saidthe application from a relatively poor country with most of itsterritory in Asia rather than Europe was likely to spark a longprocess of soul-searching among the EC's current members aboutwhat kind of European Community they wanted in the long term.    Officials echoed the view of diplomats in Ankara thatTurkey's move put the EC in the dilemma of wanting to makeclear it values Ankara as an ally in the NATO alliance, butsees huge problems in accepting it as a fellow EC member.    They said industrialised Community members have tried todissuade Turkey from making the long-discussed formalapplication until the EC had had more time to digest theaccession of Spain and Portugal last year.    Several also feel Ankara and the EC should first fullyimplement a 23-year-old association agreement between thembefore Turkey becomes a full member. REUTER&#3;
