Nigeria and Britain signed an agreementto reschedule Nigeria's official debts in the first of anexpected series of such talks, government sources said.    The agreement was signed by Nigerian Finance Minister ChuOkongwu and the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD)chief executive Jack Gill.    The Nigerians will go on to Paris for similar bilateraltalks tomorrow with Coface, the French export credit agency.    Today's agreement follows an agreement between Nigeria andthe Paris Club of western creditor governments in December toreschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt.    The Paris Club agreement was for a rescheduling of the 7.5billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace.    But as with all Paris Club pacts, specific interest ratesand other details have to be negotiated on a bi-lateral basiswith the countries involved. None of the details contained intoday's negotiations was immediately available.    The Nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords canbe struck fairly soon as this could encourage official exportcredit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports toNigeria.    The ECGD suspended its cover for exports to Nigeria in1983. Despite the success of the talks over the past two days,govenment sources said there had not been any discussions onnew credits.    Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh exportcredits this year from official agencies under a structrualadjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank tosupport a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlrforeign debt.    But these credits cannot be approved until the exportcredit agencies agree to resume insuring the debts. REUTER&#3;
