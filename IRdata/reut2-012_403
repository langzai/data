Japanese press reports said Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone has said he may compromise on hiscontroversial sales tax plan, bowing to widespread oppositioneven within his own party.    The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of hisruling Liberal Democratic Party today the proposed five pct taxshould be amended if there was anything wrong with it.    Officials were not immediately available for comment.    Until now, Nakasone had vowed to press on with the tax aspart of his plan to reform Japan's 36-year-old tax system.    But most Japanese newspapers and news agencies quoted himas saying today he would not foist the tax on the Japanesepeople if they hated it.    Opposition parties and some industry groups say the taxbreaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last Julyand would discourage consumer spending, needed to meetgovernment pledges to try to stimulate economic growth.    Pressure for the tax to be amended or shelved is likely toincrease soon, before a first round of local elections due onApril 12, political analysts said. Resistance has spread fromopposition parties and affected industries to the LDP.    Some 36 of Japan's 47 provincial governments have calledfor the plan to be scrapped or handled carefully, governmentofficials said.    Some leading LDP candidates for the local polls have notasked Nakasone to make a campaign speech for them as they fearhis presence would weaken their position in the elections. REUTER&#3;
