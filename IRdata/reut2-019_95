French domestic appliance maker Moulinex&lt;MOUP.PA> shares continued to fall on the Paris Bourse reachingits year's low amid controversy over an auditor's report on1987 profit forecasts, dealers said.    A Moulinex spokesman said a "mutilated" copy of the report byParis auditors Syndex, which gave a poor impression of thecompany's prospects, had caused the stock to fall sharply.    Meanwhile, Moulinex said in a communique that it stood byits April forecast of a 1987 parent company net loss of 41.7mln francs vs a 226 mln loss in 1986.    The spokesman said 50 pages of the 200-page report,commissioned by Moulinex's staff/management committee, had beencirculated to several Parisian stockbrokers.    The Syndex report said the company's 1987 target would bedifficult to achieve, thereby causing Moulinex stock to dropalmost 13 francs in two days to 75.10 francs per share.    A Syndex spokesman said yesterday that the auditors were"shocked" by the leak of a confidential document and attributedit to "malicious intentions." Several Paris brokers said it waslikely that corporate "raiders" interested in a takeover bid hadput out the Syndex report to bring down the share price.    Moulinex shares have fluctuated considerably since thebeginning of the year on takeover rumours, reaching a high of122 francs.    Group president Jean Mantelet, who is 87, said in Februarythat he intended to transfer his 42 pct stake in Moulinex tothe company's employees. However, a company statement issued atthe same time said a management buy-out was only one of severaloptions.    The rest of the group's equity has been held by privateinvestors since March when &lt;Scovill Inc> of the U.S. Sold its20 pct holding in the company. REUTER&#3;
