Senior officials from government andthe ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) rejectedbusiness sector calls this week to reprivatise the 26 Mexicanbanks, nationalised five years ago.    PRI president Jorge de la Vega, speaking in Saltillo,Coahuila state, said the party would never permitreprivatisation "because the banks belong to all Mexicans."    Speaking in Hermosillo, Sonora State, Deputy FinanceMinister Francisco Suarez Davila said the nationalised bankshave proved a positive instrument through which the governmenthas been able to promote economic development.    Suarez davila said that in the hands of the state, bankshave performed well and that the government will adopt whateverreorganization is needed to improve efficiency.    Earlier this week, the newly elected head of the powerfulbusiness coordinating council, agustin legorreta, called forthe banks to be reprivatized, charging that competition andefficiency had been eroded.    Then president jose lopez portillo nationalised the banksin 1982, accusing them of aiding capital flight.
