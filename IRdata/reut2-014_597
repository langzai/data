Japan should promote division of labourwith its Asian neighbours, especially the newly industrializedcountries, to help achieve more balanced world economic growth,the Bank of Japan said in a report.    Instead of trying to produce everything by itself, Japanshould open up its market further to imports, transfermanufacturing facilities abroad and increase technologytransfer with those nations, the bank said in its monthlyreport.    Japan should not see industrializing Asian nations as merecompetitors in its overseas and domestic markets but ascountries that can contribute to the region's prosperity.    The bank said trade relations between Japan and the Asianneighbouring countries have so far been vertical, meaning thatJapan imports primary goods from those countries and exportsmanufactured goods to them.    But this has resulted in an increase in their tradedeficits with Japan while some newly industrialized Asiannations have accumulated trade surpluses with countries likethe United States. REUTER&#3;
