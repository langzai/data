Taiwan is holding discussions with theAsian Development Bank (ADB) to try to settle a politicaldispute over its representation in the bank, a foreign ministryspokesman said.    Taiwan, one of the founders of the 47-member ADB, boycottedthe annual meeting last year to protest against a decision tochange its membership name to "Taipei, China" after the admissionof Peking.    The foreign ministry spokesman said a decision on whetherTaiwan would attend the next meeting in Japan on April 27-29would depend on the results of the talks.
