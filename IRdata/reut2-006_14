Baker told a House foreign affairs subcommittee, "I thinkour position is absolutely clear on that ... We do not supportand will not support Soviet membership in the World Bank or theIMF."    Baker said the U.S. position was "unqualified andunconditional."    The secretary observed that he has written to congressmanJack Kemp, a New York Republican who is also a presidentialcontender, outlining the U.S. position.
