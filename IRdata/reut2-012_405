About 8,000 black miners returnedto work after a week-long industrial action at South Africa'slargest gold mine, mine owner Anglo American Corp of SouthAfrica Ltd &lt;ANGL.J> said.    A spokesman for the mining house said the action started onWednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slowat One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division ofFree State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd &lt;FSCN.J>.    The action later escalated into an underground sit-in atthe mine over the weekend, prompting management to close theaffected shaft because of what the company described as "thecreation of unsafe working conditions."    Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said thecompany held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers(NUM), South Africa's biggest trade union which claims amembership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establishthe cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that themine suffered a loss of production, but declined to giveestimates.    Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes ofgold from 28 underground shafts.    The NUM was not immediately available for comment on theaction. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the SouthAfrican Press Association that miners had been locked out ofthe mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protestagainst being ordered to carry bags containing explosives aswell as food for white miners.
