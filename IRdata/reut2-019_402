Italy's Foreign Trade Minister MarioSarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not beattributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreignsecurities.    Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month'soverall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decreeabolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreignsecurities purchases.   "The deficit can be better attributed to premature anddelayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment," Sarcinellisaid in a statement.    Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks bythe Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and saidit had been partly caused by "non-banking capital outflows."    "In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flowof capital to foreign securities or investments outside ourborders," said the newspaper.    But the newspaper added that it was still not possible tosay how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchasedeposits had affected Italy's balance of payments. Reuter&#3;
