The U.S. Supreme Court upheldaffirmative action programmes designed to promote women in theworkplace yesterday, handing President Reagan's civil rightspolicy a major defeat.    Tn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the civil rightslaws allow employers to take the gender of workers into accountto improve female representation in the workforce.    The Reagan administration had charged that affirmativeaction is reverse discrimination.    The case involved the 1980 promotion of a female road yardclerk, Diane Joyce, over a more qualified male, Paul Johnson. REUTER&#3;
