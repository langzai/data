House Speaker James Wright saidPresident Reagan should realize that there will be no way tomeet the deficit reduction targets in the 1988 budget without atax increase.    "In my judgment there isn't any way to achieve the commandedreductions in the deficit without some additional revenue," theTexas Democrat told reporters before the opening of the Housesession.    Wright said the Democrats intended to make the additionaltax burden fairer than was Reagan's plan for 22 billion dlrs inadditional revenues in the 1988 budget.    "It's not a question of whether new revenue is needed, it'sa question of who has to pay," Wright said.    He has opposed deficit reduction proposals included inReagan's budget which would raise fees on medicare recipients,tax black lung benefits and reduce tax breaks for homepurchases.    Wright has sought to delay the 1988 income tax rate cut buthas said other options such as a tax on securities transferswere merely floated as possible deficit reduction alternatives.    "There has to be a recognition of reality," he said. Reuter&#3;
