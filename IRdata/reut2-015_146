Advanced Micro Devices Inc said it isdeveloping a set of five computer chips for use in digitalcommunications systems.    The company said the new chips support the integratedservices digital network, or ISDN, the international standardfor digital voice and data communications.    Advanced Micro also said it has signed a licensingagreement with American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> underwhich ATT has provided it with certain digital communicationsspecifications.    Today's announcement follows the company's introductionlast week of a 32-bit microprocessor.    "We have now reached a key point in the development ofcommunications devices that implement a worldwide ISDNstandard," said John East, group vice president for AdvancedMicro's logic businesses.    He said the company's new computer chips, to be availableby the end of this year, should boost the acceptance andimplementation of ISDN services.     The chip set includes five separate devices in 100 unitquantities. The devices are priced from 7.25 dlrs to 29.25dlrs. Similar chip sets for ISDN communications are alreadybeing sold by a number of companies including INTEL Corp&lt;INTC>, ATT, Rockwell International &lt;ROK> and a joint venturebetween Northern Telecom LTd &lt;NT> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT>.    The ISDN standard, portions of which are still beingdefined, will provide for the simultaneous transmission ofvoice, data and video.    Advanced Micro chip sets will be used in equipment such asprivate branch exchanges and desktop computers.    The company also said it is developing an ISDN protocolcontroller. It said the controller will connect directly withits current line of ISDN devices.    The device supports several digital communicationsprotocols, including ones from International Business MachinesCorp &lt;IBM> and ATT. Reuter&#3;
