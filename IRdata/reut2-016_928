Federal Reserve Board Governor WayneAngell said the Reagan appointed majority on the board was notat odds with Chairman Paul Volcker on whether interest ratesshould rise to support the dollar.    "I would anticipate very little difference between thechairman's position on price-level stability - and on the viewof the dollar in foreign exchange markets - and my own," Angellsaid in an interview with the New York Times.    "And I would also see very little difference in (Governor)Manley Johnson's position and my own," he added.    The newspaper said Angell was speaking in response toinquiries concerning a report by syndicated columnists RowlandEvans and Robert Novak that Volcker was ready to raise rates todefend the dollar but that he was being thwarted by the fourReagan appointed members on the board.    Angell told the newspaper that there was no evidence ofdisagreement on the board and that "anyone who should suggest"there is one "might be reaching pretty far." Reuter&#3;
