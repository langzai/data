American soybean producers and processorsare hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats willnot be imposed, but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if itis introduced.    Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Association's firstvice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administrationwould not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers andprocessors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation.    U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letterto EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover morethan agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennettsaid.    The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA)delegations will meet top West German government officialstoday and tomorrow to lobby for support.    Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands,Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seemto have taken a hardline view on the issue.    "Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to theiradvantage economically, but that is not correct because wewould hit back," NSPA chairman Jack Reed said.    This step would be very expensive for all and no one wouldemerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said.    Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybeanindustry view the EC proposal as violating the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindingsagreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962, he said.    Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans andproducts can be exported to the Community duty-free. REUTER&#3;
