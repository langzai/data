Africa's efforts to revive itseconomy are not being matched by international help, two of thecontinent's heads of state said at the opening of a conference.    Presidents Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo urged Africa's development partners to actover the continent's debt, which now totals 175 billion dlrs,at a meeting organised by the Economic Commission for Africa(ECA).    Their view was backed by Monique Landry, Canada's Ministerfor External Relations. "Whether we look at aid or debt ortrade, the rich countries have not as yet lived up to theirpart of last year's economic recovery pact."    Babangida said it was unrealistic to expect any country tospend more than 30 pct of its earnings on debt servicingparticularly as prices for the continent's commodities were sounstable.    Sassou Nguesso, current Chairman of the Organisation ofAfrican Unity, accused international aid donors of failing toprovide the vigorous effort they promised a year ago.    The conference, attended by African ministers, economistsand representatives from major donors, will review progresssince both sides agreed at the U.N. Last year to revive theAfrican economy over five years.    The response from the international community has beennegative and projections of improved growth rates for Africaalready look far too optimistic, ECA Executive SecretaryAdebayo Adedeji told the conference.    Both Babangida and Sassou Nguesso called for the debts ofAfrica's poorest countries to be written off and for repaymentand grace terms to be eased.    They won a degree of support from Landry, "Even privatebankers are willing to talk about the need for longer termsolutions to Africa's debt." REUTER&#3;
