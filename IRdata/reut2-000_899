Employers and the port union, FNV, areto meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of thesix-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, butneither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides toldReuters.    Little progress was made in last night's three hours oftalks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.    "There is still a very large gap between the employers andthe FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said.    Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accusedthe FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at allover the past two months.    "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I amreally not optimistic about it changing its point of view atall."    "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses toaccept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector,then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may beginlater this month," Schoufour said.    The series of strikes, which employers say has cost themmore than seven mln guilders in lost import business in thepast six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with350 this year.    Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf saidunless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdrawthe sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy.    Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting outtheir cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear fromhim before Wednesday at the earliest. Reuter&#3;
