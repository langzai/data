&lt;Quintette Coals Ltd> of Canada andJapanese steelmakers failed to agree on the Canadian coal baseprice over four years from April 1, but agreed to have anotherround of talks in late May, officials involved said.    Japanese firms have asked for the base price to be set at44 U.S. Dlrs per tonne (FOB), sharply lower than the 75 to 76dlrs of the past four years, they told Reuters. The base priceis reviewed every four years under the long-term accord.    The Canadian mine insisted on maintaining the presentprice, they said.    Japanese firms bought 4.75 mln tonnes of Quintette coal in1986/87, and plan to buy the same volume in 1987/88 dependingon the result of the talks, the officials said. They addedJapan has no plans to withdraw its price cutback request due torecent falls in coking coal prices on the world market.    Meanwhile &lt;Gregg River Co> of Canada has agreed on aJapanese proposal to set a temporary price of 75.80 Canadiandlrs on and after May shipment following the failure of the1987/88 price talks, they said. Japanese firms plan to buy150,000 tonnes of Gregg River coal for May shipment and holdanother round of talks with Gregg in late May, they added. REUTER&#3;
