Details of today's agreement to handover Portuguese-ruled Macao to China will be released after theofficial signing in Peking on Thursday, Portuguese Ambassadorto Peking Octavio Valerio said.    Valerio earlier told reporters that the tiny territorywould be returned to Chinese rule on December 20, 1999, butgave no further details.    A statement issued today did not give details of theagreement as earlier expected.    "We are very happy with the results," Valerio said after fourdays of negotiations in the Chinese capital.    The talks were the fourth in a series on the Macao questionand had been expected to focus on the status of the 40,000Portuguese passport-holders among Macao's 400,000 residents.    Asked if the issue of nationality after the Chinesetakeover had been a problem in the talks, Valerio replied: "Itwas one of them."    China traditionally opposes granting dual nationality toits citizens and requires holders of foreign passports to giveup their Chinese citizenship.    In Taipei, Taiwan said it would not recognise theagreement. A Foreign Ministry statement said: "We regard theagreement on the Macao issue as null and void."    It said: "Macao should be returned to the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan because communist China, a rebel entity, has no rightto represent China and all the Chinese people.    "The handover by the Portuguese government is in disregardof the freedom, welfare and safety of more than 400,000 Chinesepeople there. We will try our upmost to help and protect them."    Taiwan's Kuomintang (Nationalist) government claims to ruleall China. It has no diplomatic relations with Portugal. REUTER&#3;
