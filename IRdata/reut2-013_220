Oil output in the United Arab Emirates(UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customerresistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sourcessaid.    The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buyAbu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs abarrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72dlrs.    The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAEproducer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.    Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd fromaround 370,000 in February after the emirate declared amid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, thesources added.    Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaifand Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixedprices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.    The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japaneseterm buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, theyadded. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of itMurban.    Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came onstream in 1983, to be test production not included incalculations for complying with the OPEC quota.    Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly itsquota in March, the sources added. REUTER&#3;
