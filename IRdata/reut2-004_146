The Commodity Futures TradingCommission, CFTC, should increase speculative position limitson agricultural futures and do away with them for financialfutures, Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, chairman Karsten Mahlmannsaid.    Reporting to the CFTC Financial Products Advisory Committeeon the conclusions so far of an ad hoc CBT committee onoff-exchange trading issues, Mahlmann said, "We came to theconclusion that no meaningful purpose is served by speculativeposition limits."    Position limits were supposed to prevent marketmanipulation, but "I would submit that the Exchange and theCFTC currently have all the tools necessary to prevent marketmanipulation, whether an account is speculative or a hedge,"the CBT chairman said.    Malmann said the issue was of particular concern to the CBTbecause the exchange faced increasing competition from foreignmarkets, most of which did not have position limits.    He said the ad hoc committee, which he also chairs, hadagreed to propose that the definition of hedging be expanded toinclude risk management as well as risk reduction.    Mahlmann said there was a danger that if a category oftrading was given a name such as "non-speculative hedging,"insurance companies and pension funds might be held back fromengaging in it by the regulatory bodies that govern suchentities.    The ad hoc committee proposed the establishment of"prudence guidelines" and a list of market activities that fellwithin those lines which might be lengthened in the future, hesaid.    The committee might also propose that CBT itself be allowedto enforce position limits on agricultural futures, he added. Reuter&#3;
