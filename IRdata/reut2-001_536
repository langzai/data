International BusinessMachines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computerchip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms lightinto electrical signals that translate into computer language.    IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chipreported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second.    The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electricalsignals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits.    IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficientin turning light signals into electrical signals, it seems tobe an ideal material for the light-based computercommunications expected to be widely used in the future.    The chip's speed is also enhanced through the eliminationof wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetectorand transistor circuitry close together.    Bringing these elements closer together also isolates thereceiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise anddistortion, it said. Reuter&#3;
