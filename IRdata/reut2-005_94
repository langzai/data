The New York Stock Exchange sought todefuse a trans-Atlantic flap over whether member firms cantrade stocks on London's electronic dealing system during NewYork trading hours.    "I don't know what the hub-bub is about," said RichardTorrenzano, NYSE spokesman. Some member firms had said theywere worried that a strict interpretation of NYSE rule 390curtail trading when London closes its trading floor next yearand all trading is done via electronic systems.    "If the British Parliament calls it a stock exchange,that's good enough for us," Torrenzano said.    Torrenzano did not see any conflict with rule 390 ifmembers wanted to trade in London. The rule, in effect sincethe mid 1970's, says in part, "During NYSE trading hours amember, a member organization or affiliated person may trade asprincipal or agent in any listed stock on any organizedexchange of which they are a member, in any foreign country atany time."    "The rule has not been changed, there is nothing new here,"he said. Reuter&#3;
