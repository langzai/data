Moody's Investors Service Inc said itdowngraded the ratings on six billion dlrs of debt of MerrillLynch and Co Inc.    Cut were the firm's senior debt, Eurodebt and seniorguaranteed Eurodebt to A-1 from Aa-3 and subordinated debt toA-2 from A-1.    Merrill's Prime-1 commercial paper was not under review.    Moody's said that while Merrill's absolute earnings wouldcontinue to increase, the house's profitability will lag thatof its peers. And Merrill's attempts to improve profitabilitywill be constrained by accelerating competition, Moody's said.    Moody's also said Merrill Lynch would continue toaggressively commit its capital to such merchant bankingactivities as bridge financing.    "These activities elevate the risk content of Merrill'sbalance sheet at the same time as low profitability inhibitsthe strong internal capital generation which may be necessaryto support business expansion efforts," Moody's said.    The rating agency noted, however, that Merrill's franchiseretains significant value and gives the firm strong proprietarysecurities placement power. Reuter&#3;
