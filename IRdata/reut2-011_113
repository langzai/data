Anglo American Gold Investment Cochairman Julian Thompson urged the South African government torepeal legislation preventing black advancement in the miningindustry.    Thompson, commenting in the annual report, said the miningindustry remained "cynical" about whether Pretoria really intendsto remove barriers which prevent blacks from holding skilledjobs.    He urged the government to back up pledges by introducing abill when parliament reconvenes later this year.    The vast majority of South Africa's 600,000 miners areblack but whites perform most supervisory jobs.    The government has vowed to open all mining jobs to allraces this year but the mining industry fears clauses insertedin an abolition bill could be used to make it difficult forblacks to qualify for skilled positions.    "The reluctance of the government to repeal (discriminatoryprovisions) obstructs the advancement of blacks and denies themopportunities for taking increasing responsibilities," Thompsonsaid.
