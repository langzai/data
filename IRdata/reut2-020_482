Spain is threatened with massive imports from thirdcountries by the end of the year, they said.

Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under areduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee maydecide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board tomake direct purchases.    The sources said Romero urged that other EC countriesshould take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of theSpanish market.    They said he threatened to withhold support for the ECCommission plan for new limits on farm output which if breachedwould mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.
