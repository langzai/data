The National Farmers Union, NFU, remainsconcerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despitelast week's decision by the government to block bids fromItaly's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle Plc.    The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to considerthe implications of a government Monopolies and MergerCommission, MMC, report issued last week. "We are stillconcerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners ofBritish Sugar," a spokesman said. "We do not view Berisford asproviding the long-term stability we want."    The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendationlast week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for Sand W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majorityof British Sugar, owned by Berisford.    Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beetprocessor is now likely. "We are looking again at theundertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders andwhich we would seek of any future bidders," the spokesman said.The NFU, which represents Britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers,is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMCreport which it says need further explanation.
