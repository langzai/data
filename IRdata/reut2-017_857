The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) said it would issue guidelines later this monthfor microchip production during the third quarter.    A MITI official said it was too early to say if theguidelines would call for reductions following similargovernment requests in the first two quarters of 1987.    "This is not a matter which should be decided on a politicalbasis alone," the official told Reuters.    MITI asked that production of 256 kilobit dynamic randomaccess memory chips and erasable programmable read only memorychips be cut by 11 pct during the April/June quarter.    Production was cut back 10 pct in the first quarter andindustry analysts said the reductions have boosted prices.    U.S. And Japanese officials met in Washington last week todiscuss the removal of U.S. Sanctions against some Japaneseexports but both sides agreed not to reveal the outcome of thetalks, the MITI official added.    Washington imposed the sanctions in April, saying Tokyo hadfailed to abide by a 1986 pact on microchip trade. REUTER&#3;
