Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid current low unit wage costs are helping British exportsbut wage rises are "faster than is comfortable."    He hoped yesterday's Organisation for Economic Cooperationand Development (OECD) forecasts of increases in wage riseswere wrong, saying OECD predictions "are somewhat unreliable."    "Productivity is rising very fast, and therefore even thoughwages are going up faster than is comfortable, the actual unitcost of labour...Is not going up fast at all," Lawson said inanswer to questions on BBC radio.    "That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well inexport markets, for example, but we could do even better andget unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderaterate of growth in wage increases," Lawson added.    His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlyingaverage earnings were rising 7.75 pct annually in April, upfrom March's 7.5 pct increase, which sent the U.K. Governmentbond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries.    Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecastsfor the U.K. Until the traditional Autumn Statement on theeconomy.    Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basicrate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the nextbudget due in March 1988.    "We will certainly achieve it sooner or later," he said.    The latest official data, released yesterday, showed unitwage costs in manufacturing industry were rising 0.9 pctannually in the three month period ended April, down from a 1.2pct rise in the first quarter and sharply below last year'sfirst quarter growth rate of 7.8 pct.    However, analysts said this figure is likely to deterioratesomewhat as productivity growth slows later this year. REUTER&#3;
