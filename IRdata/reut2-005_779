Taiwan's central bank is consideringproposals to ease currency restrictions to reduce foreignexchange reserves of 51 billion U.S. Dlrs, a local newspaperreported today.    The China Times, which has close ties with the government,quoted central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng as saying thegovernment had agreed in principle to liberalise financialrestrictions.    The bank was considering proposals to allow firms andindividuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreignstocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying.    All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks andexchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may onlyinvest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills andcertificates of deposit.    Central bank and other government officials were notavailable to comment on the report.    Economists said it was likely that the government wouldease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually.    They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainlyfrom huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan atarget for U.S. Protectionism.    Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billionU.S. Dlrs last year compared with 10.2 billion in 1985.    "The central bank has to go in this direction," said SuHan-min, chief economist with the International Commercial Bankof China. "If they don't quicken the pace, Washington couldretaliate and really damage Taiwan." REUTER&#3;
