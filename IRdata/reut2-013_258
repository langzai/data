The failure of the Bangladesh governmentto tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to afamine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, KhaledaZia, told a press conference yesterday.    Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the countryin March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheatsales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.    Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-Aprilwill ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the aridnorth and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual atthis time of the year," one official said.    Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials andfailure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Herremarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heatwave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in thesouth-west.    Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two orthree weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes ofrice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. Itrevised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln.
