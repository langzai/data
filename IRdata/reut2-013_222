Production in the manufactured goodsindustry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline bybetween one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in1986, the Ifo economic institute said.    An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affectingthe engineering industry particularly. It saw a decline of twoto three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986.    Orders, especially from abroad, were also falling sharplyfor capital goods in the electronics sector, it added.    Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose5.1 pct.    Chemical industry production, which fell by 0.9 pct lastyear, was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987.This sector suffered from slack demand from abroad and from lowdomestic consumption.
