Zimbabwe's real gross domestic productincreased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figurespublished by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). Thiscontrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.    The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth wasa drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previousyear. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturingproduction increased 1.4 pct.    The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDPdeflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually nogrowth in real output during 1986.
