Japan's trade surplus is likely tocontinue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroadincrease while domestic demand remains sluggish, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)said.    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, theOECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus lastyear, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 whileexport markets rose by only two pct.    But it said this differential between the growth ofdomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,"thus weakening the international adjustment process."    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over twopct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pctin 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 willrise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billionyen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demandand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said themeasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quitepossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects haveworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.    The OECD outlook said, "Continued large current accountsurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantialnet external asset position could well lead to upward pressureon the yen." It said that further appreciation could then leadmanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thusweaken domestic growth.    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely togorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pctgrowth. But it said Japan would continue its good performanceon inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year. Reuter&#3;
