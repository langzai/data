The dollar straight sector of theeurobond market ended lower after another nervous day'strading, with many operators keeping to the sidelines ahead oftomorrow's U.S. Trade figures for February, dealers said.Prices of longer dated issues ended 1/2 or 5/8 point lower,while short dates were 1/8 to 3/8 point easier.    Bonds for Texaco Inc units hardly traded during the dayfollowing the weekend news that the company filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy protection in another twist to its long runningdispute with Pennzoil Co, dealers added.    The Chapter 11 filing means that Texaco will not be payinginterest on its eurobonds. Dealers in the straight bonds notedthat the market in them had been basis only for some time priorto the weekend's news. "It wasn't a true market, someone askedyou a price and you just gave them an idea," one said.    However, the company's convertible bonds had been tradingsince the company's share price provided a benchmark to whichdealers could establish a proper price level. The company hastwo actively traded convertibles outstanding, a 500 mln dlrbond due 1994 which pays 11-3/4 pct and a one billion dlr deal,also due 1994, paying 11-7/8 pct.    Traders even disagreed about last week's closing levels forthe convertible bonds, but a median appeared to be around 97 to99 pct. Today, one trader said they were indicated initially at65 to 70 pct before ending at some 79 83 pct.    But he added, "That's only an idea. There's no real markettoday. I've dealt once during the day, I'm not going to say atwhat level." Other dealers were reluctant even to give anindication of the bonds' levels.    Dealers said the market in all Texaco deals will almostcertainly remain on an indicated, or negotiated, basis untilthe events of the weekend are further clarified.
