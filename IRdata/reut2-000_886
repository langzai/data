Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year fromJanuary's three pct record, senior economists, including SusumuTaketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since thegovernment's Management and Coordination Agency began compilingstatistics under its current system in 1953.    "There is a general fear that we will become a country withhigh unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist forthe Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.    The government, which published the January unemploymentfigures today, did not make any predictions.    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemploymentrate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situationimproving," a Labour Ministry official said.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government hadexpected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conferencethe record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budgetwhich has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steeland shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employeesand ceased hiring, economists said.    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed agreat number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo BankLtd's economics department.    However, other economists disagreed, saying the servicesector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by themanufacturing sector over the next five years. Reuter&#3;
