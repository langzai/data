In a fresh sign of the strains causedby Brazil's suspension of interest payments on its medium-andlong-term debt, U.S. bank regulators have lowered their ratingof the country's creditworthiness to "substandard," bankerssaid.    Brazil was previously ranked as an "other transfer riskproblem." Reserves would have to be set aside for loans toBrazil only if its credit rating were lowered by another notchto "value impaired," but bankers said the regulators' decisionshould be read as a sign of official concern about thedeterioration in Brazil's finances.    The downgrading was decided by the Interagency CountryValuation Review Committee, which groups regulators fromthe Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpand the Comptroller of the Currency.    The downgrading coincides with the move by several majorU.S. banks to place their loans to Brazil on non-accrual statusbecause of the February 20 suspension of interest on 68 billiondlrs of term debt.    By declaring the loans non-performing, the banks wipe outtens of millions of dollars of accrued, but uncollected,interest payments from their first-quarter accounts. Reuter&#3;
