French household consumption ofindustrial goods fell 1.1 pct seasonally adjusted to 21.32billion francs last month from 21.55 billion in January, theNational Statistics Institute (INSEE) said.    This brought consumption back down to the December 1986level, it added.    INSEE said that the fall was due to a sharp decline inpurchases of clothing, which were high in January due to thecold weather. The decline was partly compensated by a smallrise in purchases of durable goods. Reuter&#3;
