Aluminium scrap recovery and usage andoutput of secondary metal will continue to rise, said ShearsonLehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium marketwhich details cost and demand factors.    Although primary smelting costs have declined generally inrecent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offeredby secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted materialincreasingly attractive.    It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricityto produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.    On the demand side, developments in automobiles andpackaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.    Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for theforeseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castingsis gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,particularly in the U.S.    In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium todominate the beverage can market in any of the other majoreconomies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there isevidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.    In addition to the cost savings involved, technologyadvances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced bythe secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.    There is not likely to be a problem of availability as theU.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true ofseveral European countries, albeit on a smaller scale. Reuter&#3;
