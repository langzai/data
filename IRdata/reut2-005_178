Zambia's talks with the World Bank andInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue packagehave run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, anofficial newspaper said.    The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling UnitedNational Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources assaying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financingfood subsidies and were pressing the government to explain howit proposes to pay for them.    President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidieslast December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the movecaused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riotsin which 15 people were killed.    The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves toquell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost thegovernment about 500 mln kwacha per year.    The Times of Zambia said another major issue in thegovernment's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was theremodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.    The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange tothe private sector has been suspended since the end of January,pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation anddampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.    The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auctionsystem, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, sincethe end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nineper dollar.    Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bankand IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollaron the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.    According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led byassistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to concludeits talks with the government on schedule on March 23.    The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and itstalks with the government have taken longer than expected. REUTER&#3;
