Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrdyesterday failed to win the 60 votes needed to force a Senatevote on a bill demanding President Reagan account for U.S. Aidto the Nicaraguan Contras, including millions of dollarsdiverted to the rebels from U.S. Arms sales to Iran.    Following the defeat, Byrd said he would drop his effort,ending congressional manoeuvring over the 40 million dlr finalinstalment of a 100-million-dlr aid package approved last yearfor the contras.    Without congressional action to stop it, the aid becamelegally available to the Contras last weekend. REUTER&#3;
