Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid satisfactory progress has been made in talks with Japanthat would lead to membership of the Tokyo Stock Exchange forthree British merchant banks next year.    Following weekend talks here between Japanese and Britishofficials Lawson told reporters "we have achieved our objective."    The three applicants, &lt;Baring Brothers and Co Ltd>,&lt;J.Henry Wagg and Co Ltd> and Kleinwort Benson Lonsdale Plc&lt;KSLL.L>, would join "when the Stock Exchange has been extended,"he said.    The TSE has said this will be completed in May 1988. It hasrepeatedly said it cannot accommodate any new members untilthen because of limited space on its trading floor.    During a visit to Tokyo in April, U.K. Corporate AffairsMinister Michael Howard presented Japanese officials with whathe called a non-negotiable timetable for granting the threeBritish securities companies TSE membership.    Howard said Britain expected a favourable response at lastweekend's meeting and wanted the firms to be made membersbefore next May. If Tokyo failed to act, Britain was ready toretaliate against Japanese financial groups in London, headded.    Last month the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced plans to setup a special committee to study the membership question.    The committee is due to produce a report by the autumn.This would allow the TSE to announce formally by the end of theyear who will be granted membership, although the companieschosen would not be able to start trading until May.
