Brazilian marines were todayworking on the unloading of ships at the local port as anational strike by 40,000 seamen entered its 10th day withoutsigns of an agreement.    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,started on February 27, and union leaders said they would notreturn to work unless they received a 275 pct pay rise.    Shipowners have offered a 100 pct raise, which the seamenrejected.    "Television reported that the port was operating at fullspeed, but that's not true," a striking seaman told Reuters.    "The marines are doing their best, but they don't have themanpower nor the experience to control the situation in such aquick period," he said.    Port officials said the national halt had already causedlosses estimated at 1.5 mln dlrs.    Despite the presence of marines, there were no reports ofincidents. Reuter&#3;
