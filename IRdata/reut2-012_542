The World Bank will prepay on July 9,1987 and July 17, 1987 the total amount outstanding of twoSwiss franc public issues, in the first of what could be aseries of similar moves in other capital markets, a spokesmanfor the Bank said in a telephone call from Washington.    The prepayments cover 96 mln Swiss francs of 6-1/2 pctSwiss franc bonds of 1976 and due 1991, lead managed by SwissBank Corporation and 100 mln Swiss francs of 7-3/8 pct bonds of1981 and due 1991, lead managed by Credit Suisse.    Eugene Rotberg, World Bank vice president-treasurer, saidin a prepared statement that the prepayments are being madebecause of the substantial decline in interest rates over thepast two years, the spokesman said.    The World Bank intends to exercise early redemption onselected public issues of its securities in Switzerland andother capital markets if the exercise is financially beneficialand consistent with the Bank's overall funding strategy.    Last month, Rotberg said that the World Bank planned tobring forward to the first half of 1987 its borrowing plans forthe year because of its expectations that world interest rateswill rise by the year end.
