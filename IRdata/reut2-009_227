Papua New Guinea(PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in theAsia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst FereidunFesharaki said here.    The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNGon the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he toldthe Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annualconference.    Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-WestCenter in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacificpetroleum outlook.    With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharakisaid.    The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the bestoil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.    The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paperdistributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves atabout 500 mln barrels.    PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region withno secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.    "We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, anddiscovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to(light) Bass Strait crude," Fesharaki said.    There are also large pockets of high quality condensates tobe produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which iscapable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.    But prices should be somewhat higher than the presentlevels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.    The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five largeprospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG. REUTER&#3;
