Plans to rejuvenate Poland's economyby reducing central government control would help reassureWestern creditors that the country's economy was safe to investin, a senior Polish official said.    "The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad abusiness as you might imagine," senior Polish governmentspokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm.    Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture atthe Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week thatPoland would soon offer shares to private citizens in statecompanies in a bid to make the economy more responsive.    This was part of a major economic reform to be announced inthe coming weeks, he said.    Urban said the main problem with his country's foreign debtburden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest chargesbut  the long term looked more secure.    He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club,grouping Poland's main government creditors, would shortlysolve the problem of short term servicing.    Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering theexpansion of the national economy, but that the new plans foreconomic reform would "open new vistas for Polish exports."    He criticised the blocking efforts of some Westerngovernments, whom he declined to name, for putting politicalconsiderations ahead of economic co-operation.    "After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polisheconomy we considered all political obstacles had been removed,but that has not been the case," Urban said. REUTER&#3;
