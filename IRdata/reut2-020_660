Chase Manhattan Corp (CMB)president Thomas Labrecque said the sharp decline in the stockmarket was not justified by economic conditions and there was aneed for perspective by investors on fundamental economicconditions.    "If we are right about the fundamentals, this thing shouldsettle down," Labrecque said at a news conference at theAmerican Bankers Associatioon annual convention here.    Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause U.S.monetary officials to ease credit policies.    Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believesinflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year,Labrecque said.   He said strong economic conditions would permit growth tocontinue well into 1988.    "I don't think the stock market will cause a recession,"Labrecque said.    He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase fromthe stock market fall would be. Chase's stock price, however,dropped 23 pct, but other money center banks suffered evensharper losses.    Referring to the banking industry, he said: "We're talkingabout one day."    "These are strong institutions," he said. Labrecque said hedid not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetarypolicy in view of the stock market's behavior.    "If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit theother way," he said. Labrecque said the high U.S. budget deficitwas not the single most important factor behind the market'sworries.    He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by theUnited States, West Germany, Japan and Britain. Reuter&#3;
