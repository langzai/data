Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said hewas maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after theannouncement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise inretail prices for February.    He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise histarget for 1987 after the February monthly result of between0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pctyear on year) that forced the government to revise an earliertarget of two pct to a current 2.5 pct.    He said he was happy with "a good result" for February butstressed a need for continued "vigilance" against inflation.    A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-yeardifferential between French and lower West German inflationrates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed inFebruary to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January.    If calculated on the last 12 months, the differential cameto 3.9 pct, the statement said, adding "The tendency istherefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our maintrading partner."
