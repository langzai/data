While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billionguilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporaryimprovements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delaybetween the fall in oil and gas prices.    The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit oninvisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the FinanceMinistry said, noting the surplus on transport services wasreduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil pricefalls.
