Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly andhave improved the prospects for a reduction in externalimbalances to more sustainable levels.    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making InterimCommittee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement lastnight that the substantial exchange rate changes since thePlaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencieswithin ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."    Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally beenorderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction ofexternal imbalances to more sustainable levels."    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances"simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.    He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strongdomestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closelywith the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.    "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doingwhat we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," hesaid.    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund'sexecutive board to review possible modifications to the Fund'scompensatory financing facility before the annual meeting thisfall.    "We should pay particular attention to the lack ofcontinuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFFand to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeedtemporary," he said. Reuter&#3;
