Norway will from June require financeinstitutions and insurance companies to report lending volumeto the central bank once a month rather than quarterly in a bidto tighten domestic lending, Finance Ministry officials said.    Norwegian Bank Association President Trond Reinertsen toldReuters the new rule would make it more difficult for banks totransfer funds to financial and insurance companies forlending.    Banks have in the past used the two month lapse in loanregistration to transfer money for lending to finance andinsurance groups to avoid penalty reserve requirements forlending in excess of government set ceilings.    The new rule brings loan reporting requirements forinsurance and finance companies in line with those alreadyapplied to commercial banks, Ministry officials said.    Borrowers have increasingly sought loans from finance andinsurance companies after the central bank last year clampeddown on what it called excessive bank lending.    Bank lending dropped by five billion crowns in January from260 billion crowns the previous month in response to thestricter penalty reserve requirements, Oslo bankers said.    They said recent central bank cuts in the overnight rate itcharges banks might offset new pressure on interest rates. REUTER&#3;
