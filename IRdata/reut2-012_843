Abnormally high levels of radiation werefound in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months afterthe Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscowwere advised this week.    In a letter to the West German community here, AmbassadorJoerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought inMoscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and-137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts.    Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University,including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, werefound to be free of radiation, it said.    Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts containedcaesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by theUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).    The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced noparticular health danger as most of the caesium remained in thetea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts.    The products sent for testing were bought in state shopsand private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Westernembassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratorytesting of Soviet food late last year because no abnormalradiation levels were detected.    "We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it," a U.S.Embassy spokesman said.    A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipmentremained in the embassy waiting room for British residents inMoscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests hadnot been conducted for several months.    "Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as aprecautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of anyalarming signals," he said. "If the tests had shown abnormalreadings, they would have been resumed." Reuter&#3;
