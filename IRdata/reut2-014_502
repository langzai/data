NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T> filed suit in TokyoDistrict Court to temporarily halt the manufacture andmarketing of &lt;Seiko Epson Corp>'s NEC-compatible personalcomputer series, an NEC spokesman said.    He said Seiko Epson's PC 286 computer and HDD-20 interfaceboard infringe on software copyrights of the Basic In OutSystem program of NEC's best-selling 9801 computer series.    A spokesman for Seiko Epson, which is part of the HattoriSeiko Co Ltd &lt;HATT.T> group, said its computer does notinfringe on any copyrights and will be marketed this month.    The HDD-20 interface board went on sale last December.    NEC's request for an injunction against Seiko Epson and itsmarketing subsidiary is the first entirely domestic lawsuitcharging infringement of computer software copyrights, theSeiko Epson spokesman said.    Share market analysts said that NEC controls about 70 pctof Japan's personal computer market.    Introduction of NEC-compatible machines could spark a pricewar and cut NEC's profits, as happened to InternationalBusiness Machines Corp &lt;IBM> following the introduction ofIBM-compatible machines, they added.
