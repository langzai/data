U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry allegingunfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry.    Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here lateyesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting withArgentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during atrade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week.    Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers,Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans andproducts, U.S. and Argentine officials said.    The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National SoybeanProcessors Association alleged Argentina, through differentialexport taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.    The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes onsoybeans than on products encourage the export of products andrepresented an unfair trade practice.    Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S.government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentinatook steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States wouldconsider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentineofficials said.    An Argentine official here said no timetable was given forremoval of the Argentine export taxes. Reuter&#3;
