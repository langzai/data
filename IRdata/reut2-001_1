Central bank governor Chang Chi-chengrejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of theTaiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losingorders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman forthe Taiwan Textile Federation said.    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textileassociations last Saturday the government could not fix theTaiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due toU.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to holdthe exchange rate at that level.    The federation said in its request that many local textileexporters were operating without profit and would go out ofbusiness if the rate continued to fall. Reuter&#3;
