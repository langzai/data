The Senate Banking Committee haspostponed until March 10 its meeting scheduled for tomorrow toact on a bank regulation bill.    A committee aide said the postponement was requested byRepublican members who wanted more time to look over a revised draft version of the bill which was just introduced.    That version of the bill would allow non-bank banks tocontinue activities in operation as of March 5, but wouldprohibit them from starting other financial services.    The previous draft bill would have banned non-bank bankactivities started after July 1, 1983. Reuter&#3;
