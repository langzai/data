An international protocol to severelylimit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed todamage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed thisyear, officials and scientists here said.    "By the end of this year, we should have an internationalprotocol in place we can all be proud of," U.S. Environmentalprotection agency officer Bill Long told reporters.    The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) whichare used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solventsand aerosols. The earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of theharmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.    The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo, aheadof an international conference on the problem later this monthin either Vienna, or Geneva, Long said.    Robert Watson, a program manager for atmospheric problemsat the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration saida protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCsby industry. This should be followed by a gradual reduction inCFC volume until no CFC gases are released into the air, hesaid. The U.S. Has already banned use of use CFCs in aerosolsand Japan has asked for voluntary restraint, but both still useCFCs in industrial processes. REUTER&#3;
