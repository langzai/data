U.S. retailers posted stronger thanexpected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analyststo change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for thefirst half of 1987.     "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of thebusiness we normally see later in the quarter and the realstrength of general merchandise sales will be in the secondhalf of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst MonroeGreenstein.    "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter fallsin April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.   Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a3.6 pct increase last year.     Analysts noted that February is considered a small,transitory month between winter and spring.    In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by anespecially soft February last year which was adversely affectedby severe weather.    Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,according to retailers and analysts.    "February's strong sales reflected a lot of freshmerchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due totax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.    Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales ofdurable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuinghigh levels of consumer debt.     May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> wereamong the strong performers, posting comparable store salesgains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overallsales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month.    "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programscontinued to positively impact our sales comparisons. INaddition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all ourspecialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,"said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.    Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase."Domestic sales were led by better than average increases inapparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strongcatalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.    Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc&lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early inthe month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitivestore basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.    Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales werestrongest during the early part of the month, while catalogdemand was consistently strong throughout the period.    Store sales activity varied throughout the country, rangingfrom good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.    Analysts also said gross profit margins were high asretailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventoriesthan a year ago.    "February is not a big month seasonally but these numberssuggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said DrexelBurnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.
