The Bundesbank could announce todaythat it will lift its veto on the private holding of EuropeanCurrency Unit (ECU) liabilities, banking sources said.    But this would probably be the only significant news fromtoday's council session, brought forward from its usualThursday date because of the Corpus Christi holiday here. TheBundesbank is not expected to change credit policy.    The sources said Bundesbank officials had been working outtechnical and legal problems with the ECU since the subject wasdiscussed in the presence of federal finance minister GerhardStoltenberg on May 7.    With the primary internal work on the ECU completed,approval from the 18-member central bank council was nowvirtually a mere formality, the sources said.    Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, chairing today'smeeting, said in mid-May the remaining ECU restrictions werelikely to be lifted, allowing individuals to open ECU accountsand incur liabilities previously mainly executed through theLuxembourg subsidiaries of the major German banks.    The sources said the ECU liberalisation was mainly designedto show that West Germany was prepared to play its part in theeffort to attain European Community monetary unity by 1992. REUTER&#3;
