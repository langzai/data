The Inter-American Development Banksaid it intended this year to match the over three billiondollars it lent to Latin America in 1986 despite growingpressures on its capital.    In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, theBank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries neededvast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen theirailing economies in the period ahead.    The report said that Latin America continued to emergeslowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s,with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) edging up to nearly four pctfrom 3.5 pct in 1985.    The report said the region's improved economic growth lastyear was based on a rise in internal demand and fullerutilization of previously underused production capacity.    "This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 andbeyond because no significant new investments are being made,"the report said.    The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to35.44 billion dlrs.
