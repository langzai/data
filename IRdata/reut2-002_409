The sharp fall in international coffeeprices will not affect Colombia's external credit situation,finance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters.    He said the current depression on world coffee markets wasnot totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing onColombia's financial state which he described as sound.    "Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope theforeign banking community will maintain its position toward us,"he said.    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to haverescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debtof 13.6 billion dlrs.    Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this weekfrom the opposition conservative party and the biggest tradeunion following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lowercoffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrsin revenues for 1987.    Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-americanbank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years,which he said was approved.
