A ban by a Portuguese court on thestate buying agency EPAC taking part in cereals import tendersopen to private traders will remain unless it is reversed inPortugal or challenged in the European Court of Justice,European Commission sources said.    They denied a statement yesterday by Portuguese AgricultureMinister Alvaro Barreto that the commission had accepted thatEPAC should be eligible, saying it had taken no view in thematter.    Under the terms of Portugal's accession to the EuropeanCommunity, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC is beingreduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in1990.    Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary rulingearlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to takepart, as it had done in the past, in tenders for theliberalised share of annual grain imports.
