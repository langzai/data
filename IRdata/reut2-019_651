Apollo Computer Inc said the price cutsannounced earlier today on its Domain Series 3000 computerworkstations average 35 pct to 50 pct.    An Apollo spokesman said the cuts bring prices to under5,000 dlrs for some Series 3000 models.    In addition to reducing prices, the company said it addednew monochrome and color models to the Series 3000 line thatimprove its performance and graphics capabilities.    The company made the price cuts along with the introductionof a more powerful family of workstations, the Domain Series4000.       Industry analysts had expected Apollo to reprice the Series3000 in response to aggressive price cuts made two weeks ago byDigital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> on its competingworkstations.    But the Apollo spokesman said the reductions had beenplanned for some time. "We haven't just cut prices," he added,noting that the company had improved the Series 3000 models.    Analysts have said they also expect Sun Microsystems Inc&lt;SUNW.O>, Apollo's biggest rival in the workstation market, tocut prices and introduce new models. Sun has scheduled a newconference on July eight. Reuter&#3;
