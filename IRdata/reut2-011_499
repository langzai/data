President Reagan has reaffirmed hisopposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said tradesanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war.    "We don't want to go down that road," Reagan was quoted astelling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting Frenchofficial expressed concern about the rising tide ofprotectionist sentiment in the United States.    Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended thenew sanctions against Japan and said administration officials"do not believe this will result in a trade war."    "It is the first time that the United States has taken anaction of this type and it is significant but it is nothing tobe alarmed about," the presidential spokesman added.    "We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a tradewar," he said.    Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in theJapanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill "anagreement to make some corrections."    Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congressand the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, hesaid, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act."    Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was "wellconsidered by this administration and not taken lightly."    While the White House official held open the possibilitythat Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, heindicated a settlement probably would not come in time to headoff the sanctions.    "We are always open to negotations ... Whether it (asettlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions)from going into effect is questionable at this point," thespokesman said.    The sanctions take effect in mid-April. REUTER&#3;
