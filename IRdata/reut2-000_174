In one, it said, the trial judge overruled thejury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the companyand a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned thetrial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing ofthis case by the full Court of Appeals.    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and inthe other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.    At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed allegingthe drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. Hesaid about 300 lawsuits are pending.
