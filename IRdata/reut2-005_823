Copper shares, which have laggedbehind the market, should pick up steam this year on strongerdemand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said.    "Copper prices should move up over the next four to sixquarters," said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co &lt;MER>. "Isee average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up fromaround 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued worldeconomic growth."    Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts apound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988.    Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp &lt;PD> will be a strongperformer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer.    But Asarco Inc &lt;AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales fromcopper, and Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> are also potentialwinners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of itscopper operations to its shareholders.    "In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest playand benefits most from higher copper prices," one said.    William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined miningoperations. "They've accomplished a great deal," he said.    The company's move into carbon black, a product used intires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapidgrowth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrsin 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.    Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean WitterReynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.    Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 andfour dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs thisyear and around 3.50 dlrs next year.    "The stock can go to the mid 30s," Roling said, from itscurrent level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40.    "Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't needcopper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money," saidVahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. "The shares willoutperform the market over the next 18 months," he said.    But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc saysNewmont Mining is a more attractive investment. "We'd ratherplace our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see asignificant premium to the current stock price," he said.    After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont willhave gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co&lt;NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations,Toufexis noted.    Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40dlrs from operations in 1986.    "I'd be buying up to 90," Toufexis said last week, when thestock rose sharply to near that level. "But the shares areprobably worth about 108 dlrs (each)."    Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball likeAsarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrisonsees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against lossesin 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 andfrom three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988.    Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co&lt;CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests incoal and other minerals aside from copper.    But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpricedat current levels. "I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buyPhelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock," he said. Reuter&#3;
