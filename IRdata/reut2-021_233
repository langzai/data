Monsanto Co said sales of itsNutrasweet artificial sweetener fell slightly in the thirdquarter due to a continuing decline in usage by the powderedsoft drink market.    "It doesn't look as if there is going to be any improvementin the powdered soft drink sector," said Donna Smith, aMonsanto spokeswoman.    The company reported third quarter sales of 1.90 billiondlrs from 1.69 billion a year earlier. Nutrasweet sales fell to177 mln from 179 mln a year earlier, it said.    A growing market for diet sodas, about 90 pct of which useNutrasweet, offset much of the sales loss, said Monsanto chiefeconomist Nick Filippello.    Prospects remain strong in the diet soda market, Filippellosaid, since industry analysts predict diet carbonated softdrinks will hold about 28 pct of the soda market by year's end,up from 25 pct in 1986.    That market, coupled with increased usage of Nutrasweet insuch items as frozen desserts, should result in a 10 pctincrease in consumer consumption of the sweetener in 1987,Filippello said.    Monsanto spokeswoman Donna Smith refused to comment on thecompany's pricing policies for Nutrasweet.    However, Filippello said it was fair to assume thatMonsanto priced Nutrasweet at a lower rate for the diet sodamarket.    Nutrasweet sales have been falling since the fourth quarterof 1986 when medical studies raised questions about itspossible side effects, such as migraine headaches.    Monsanto acquired G.D. Searle and Co, Nutrasweet's maker in1986. Reuter&#3;
