U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he doubted Japan could avoid the April 17imposition of U.S. tariffs on its semiconductor products.    The three high-level Japanese government representativeswho would be coming here in the next few days to discuss theissue would probably be unable to show evidence of continuedcompliance with the semiconductor trade agreement, Yeutter toldreporters.    "It would be impossible to provide evidence of compliancewith the agreement" based on sales of only a few days time, hesaid.    Asked by reporters if the sanctions were 100 pct certainfor April 17, he said, "One could never foreclose all options.We have an obligation to listen to the arguments our tradingpartners make."    He said the length of the sanctions will be determined byJapan and Japanese semiconductor firms.    "They would be lifted only when persuasive evidence provideddemonstrates compliance," he said.    "Whether a few weeks or a few months depends on theiractions," Yeutter added. Reuter&#3;
