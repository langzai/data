Standard and Poor's Corp said it iskeeping 230 mln dlrs of debt of Caesars World Inc and CaesarsWorld Finance Corp on creditwatch with negative implications.    S and P cited Caesars World's proposed recapitalizationplan that calls for incurring one billion dlrs of bank andother debt to finance a 25 dlr per share special dividend andthe repayment of about 222.5 mln dlrs of existing debt.    It said the plan's terms would violate dividend convenantsin the rated debt's indentures and likely force refinancing ofthose issues. Caesars was placed on creditwatch for a possibledowngrade March nine following investor Martin Sosnoff's bid.    Sosnoff bid 28 dlrs per share, or 725.2 mln dlrs, for the86.4 pct of Caesars World stock he does not already own,Standard and Poor's noted.    The rating agency said an increase in Sosnoff's offer ispossible. If successful, the stock bid would markedly raiseCaesars World's financial risk and lead to a large drop in netincome and cash flow, S and P said.    Caesars World currently carries BB senior debt and B-plussubordinated debt. The finance unit's subordinated debt, whichis guaranteed by the parent, is rated B-plus. Reuter&#3;
