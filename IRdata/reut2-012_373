The Asian Development Bank (ADB) willopen an office in Jakarta later this year to speed up work onIndonesian projects, bank Vice-President S. Stanley Katz said.    "We have very large projects in Indonesia and we would liketo accelerate their implementation," Katz told Reuters.    Indonesia is the largest recipient of ADB lending. Itreceived 118 loans worth 3.7 billion dlrs for 112 projectsbetween 1968 and 1986, 19.0 pct of the ADB's total lending.Ordinary capital resources (OCR) lending to Indonesia was 3.6billion dlrs, 27.1 pct of OCR loans at end-December 1986.    Jakarta has also received loans worth 162 mln dlrs from thebank's Asian Development Fund.    ADB sources said Indonesia's cumulative disbursements atend-1986 amounted to only 1.1 billion dlrs or 30 pct of loansreceived. "Project implementation is very slow in Indonesia andwe are not very satisfied with the pace. We hope the new officemight help," Gunther Schulz, ADB Vice-President in charge ofprojects, said.    Planned projects were further slowed down in 1986 becauseof the country's budgetary problems, he added. Indonesia'srevenue from oil exports was cut in half last year.    "Decision making is quite slow, complicated and verycentralised," Schulz told Reuters.    Indonesian President Suharto set up a high-level team inJuly last year to speed up projects using ADB funds. ADBsources said bank staff have been stationed intermittently inJakarta in response to government requests.    The Jakarta office will be the third ADB office outside itsManila headquarters. The bank has a resident office in Dhakaand a South Pacific regional office in Vanuatu. REUTER&#3;
