Portugal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986,according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.    Total investment this year, the country's second as amember of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct,again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.    It added that Portugal's current account was forecast toshow a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.    Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil andraw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.    Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this yearand exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.    The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that thenon-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the currentgovernment would be maintained, particularly in budget spendingand income and in wage policy.    The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based onthe assumption that the international economic situation andPortugal's world trade relations would remain more or less thesame as in 1986.    The central bank said the high rate of investment estimatedfor 1986 was due to government policies and to increasingoptimism among firms whose financial situation had improvedsince 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year,especially in the construction and public works sectors.    Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boostinvestment last year, the bank said.
