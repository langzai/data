Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F.Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactoryprofit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower butU.S. Sales anticipated higher.    Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic saleswere expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000from 28,670 last year.    Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Lastmonth the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.    For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume thisyear to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit werebased on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, headded.    The expected drop in West German sales this year would bethe result of the so-called "grey market" for Porsche cars, hesaid. When the dollar was strong against the mark, manyPorsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegalexport to the U.S.    Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.    The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a largerpercentage of overall sales this year than before does not poseproblems for profit, the Porsche board said.    In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same timePorsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.    Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mlnmarks.    In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-partyorders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre inWeissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year forthe first time.    Porsche's net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85. REUTER&#3;
