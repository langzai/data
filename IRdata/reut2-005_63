Weyerhaeuser Co said it shouldhave significant increases in earnings in 1987 and 1988 shouldbe another very good year.    Weyerhaeuser reported 1986 earnings of 276.7 mln dlrs, or1.91 dlrs per share, on 5.65 billion dlrs in revenues.    Anticipated improved cash flows will allow the company toinvest and acquire much more aggressively than it has in thepast few years, Weyerhaeuser also said.    Weyerhaeuser, principally a lumber products company, saidthe forecast was made by the company's chief financial officerduring a meeting of institutional investors in Tokyo.    It also said its expects to see opportunities in thebuilding products area, particularly in composite panels and inother engineered products directed toward specific, rather thancommodity, end-use markets.    But it said growth may be higher in added-value products,in financial services and in other diversified businesses.    In addition, the company said rising product prices anddemand for pulp and paper are reflected in all the major worldmarkets, except in the case of some light-weighted paper gradeswhere overcapacity remains a problem.    Weyerhaeuser further stated that it has lowered itsmanufacturing cost structure and is obtaining significantproductivity increases. Reuter&#3;
