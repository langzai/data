Senators are considering offering ahost of amendments to a farm disaster assistance bill whichcould come up soon on the Senate floor, staff members said.    The bill, already passed by the House, would enable 1987winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by Midwestern floodinglast year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal incomesupport payments even if they did not plant.    Amendments considered by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.)would apply the so-called "0/92" option to all 1987 program cropsor, if that failed, to spring wheat, Senate staff said.    Sens. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa)were considering an amendment that would allow feedgrainsproducers to receive final deficiency payments in March insteadof in October.    Earlier this year Dole said advancing the final deficiencypayments would provide feedgrains producers with approximatelythree billion dlrs in income payments prior to spring plantinginstead of in the fall.    Dole and Grassley are also considering an amendment thatwould offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmersfor any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservationreserve program last year.    The bonus payment has been offered to farmers signing upfor the corn program this spring. The U.S. AgricultureDepartment has indicated it would oppose broadening the cornbonus offer.    Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) was said to be contemplatingan amendment that would offer the 0/92 option to spring wheatproducers who were prevented from planting this spring becauseof flooding last year.    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) was eyeing a measure that wouldallow cotton producers to receive disaster aid if the qualityof their crop was hurt by flooding last year.    Democrats and Republicans today were still trying to arriveat an agreement governing time to be devoted to amendments. Reuter&#3;
