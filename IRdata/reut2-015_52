World output of staple foods maintainedgrowth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, andmost of the increase was in developing countries, the directorgeneral of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)said.    Speaking to FAO's committee on world food security, EdouardSaouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal productionincrease of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued toincrease production.    Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries faceproblems in paying for all the food they need, he said.    Saouma said many of the developing world's food problemswere the result of "chaotic" world trade.    He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the"food-security situation" of the poor, with policy reforms indeveloping countries to remove existing disincentives toproduction so that agriculture could play a greater role instimulating economic growth.
