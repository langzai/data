The Kenyan economy is heading fordifficult times after a boom last year, and the country musttighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swingingtoo far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.    In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi saidhigh coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growthof five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.    The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance ofpayments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in1985, he added.    "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As aresult, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchangereserves during the year," he said.    The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreignexchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from apeak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.    Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs abarrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.    Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general declinein the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it moredifficult to finance the government's budget deficit.    Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget onservicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter ofcapital for the first time in its history, he added.    "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficultphase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative thatwe raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreignsources to finance our development," he said.    "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline onexpenditure ... And members of this house will have to take thelead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be morefrugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added. REUTER&#3;
