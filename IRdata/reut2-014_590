Nickel prices are unlikely to risesignificantly from current levels unless further steps aretaken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said inits quarterly nickel market report.    The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lbyesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, butShearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year'sbuoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.    Output reductions by producers will take effect later thisyear but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.    Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually inbalance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports fromSocialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).    It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from afirst quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in thelast quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lbcompared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchangecash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.
