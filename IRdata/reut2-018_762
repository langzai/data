Commitments to Argentina's externalfinancing program for 1987 and 1988 have reached about 91 pctof the 1.95 billion dlrs in new loans that banks have beenasked to provide, Citibank and Argentina said in a jointstatement.    This percentage is close to the "critical mass" ofcommitments that the International Monetary Fund has requestedas a condition for releasing new loans to the country.    Senior Citibank executive William Rhodes said he wasencouraged by the banks' response and that telexed commitmentscontinue to arrive.    The response of Argentina's 350 foreign bank creditors hadbeen eagerly awaited because the package is the first to bemarketed since U.S. banks, led by Citibank, decided to takelarge second-quarter losses in order to boost their reservesagainst existing loans to developing countries.    Some bankers had feared that banks would refuse to lend newmoney so soon after taking a "hit" on the old loans, buttoday's news delivers a decisive rebuff to those skeptics.    The strong response to the package was partly the result ofthe inducement of a 3/8 pct early-participation fee for thosebanks that agreed to sign up by June 17, bankers said. Reuter&#3;
