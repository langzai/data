The Ministry of Finance has started toconsider the coupon rate of the 10-year government bond issuefor November, a Ministry official said.    The underwriting syndicate may want a rise in the couponrate by nearly one point from the current 4.9 pct, he said. Butbond traders see a rise to about 5.6 pct as most likely.    Ministry officials will try to keep the rate low to meetU.S. Requests for maintenance of the interest rate differentialbetween the U.S. And Japan, the Ministry official told Reuters.    Plans for an October issue were cancelled when the Ministryand the bond underwriting syndicate failed to reach agreementon terms.    The underwriting syndicate will start negotiating with theFinance Ministry on the terms of the November issue after anychanges in the prime rate for November are decided, whichshould be by the end of this week, an underwriting source said.    Cancellation of the November bond issue is not out of thequestion, he said, adding that negotiations are expected to bedifficult. REUTER&#3;
