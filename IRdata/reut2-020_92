Chemical Bank and Marine Midland BanksInc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pctfrom 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced justlast week.    The reduction is effective immediately.    No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemicaland Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money marketrates would take.    Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investorsploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the FederalReserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support theeconomy and the financial system.    Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half apoint (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday'saverage of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discountrate cut to calm the markets, dealers said. Reuter&#3;
