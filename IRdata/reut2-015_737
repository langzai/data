Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> director ThomasWard told a High Court hearing that the company's actionagainst him and ex-chairman Ernest Saunders sought to give theimpression of an international hunt for Ward's 5.2 mln stg feein connection with the Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> takeover, thePress Association news agency reported.    In a sworn statement, Ward, a U.S. Lawyer, said Guinnesshad failed to acknowledge that his attornies in March hadoffered to put the money, less tax and various expenses, intoan escrow account where it could only be touched under agreedcircumstances.    Ward said Guinness had made a transparent attempt tobelittle his services, the PA reported.    "I wish to emphasise that the fee paid for my services was,when considered out of context, admittedly very large."    But every aspect of the (Distillers) bid - the size of thetarget, the benefit to Guinness from success, the potentialdamage from failure, the difficulties of the issues raised andthe cost for all services - were not merely large but virtuallyunprecedented in the history of English takeovers," Ward said.    Failure would have cost Guinness between 25 mln stg and 100mln stg, he added.    Ward said it was his idea to have a merger agreement withDistillers under which Distillers agreed to pay Guinness's bidcosts, the PA reported.    Ward's statement was read to the court by his lawyer PeterCurry. Ward and ex-Guinness chairman Saunders want to end atemporary court freeze of their assets up to the disputedamount of the 5.2 mln stg fee which Guinness is trying torecover.    Guinness acquired Distillers in a fierecly fought 2.7billion stg battle during 1986. The U.K. Government is alsoprobing the affair and has yet to report. Reuter&#3;
