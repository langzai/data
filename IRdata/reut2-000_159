Liquefied natural gas imports fromAlgeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though itseconomically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerianstate petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview inAlgiers that such imports would be made this year.    "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government andthe time required to restart mothballed terminals will delaythe import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gasanalyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its formercustomers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiaryof Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officialstold Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of BurlingtonNorthern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG werefeasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that havemade capital investment to handle LNG import can operateprofitably even in the current price environment,"  FrankSpadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian importson U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trendhigher by the end of 1987.    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf ofMexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firmprices, Shearson's Tulis said.   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source ofsupplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.    Company sources also said that any negotiations withAlgeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relatevolumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot marketvalues. Reuter&#3;
