Marine Midland Banks Inc said in afiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it mayreclassify as "nonperforming" 359 mln dlrs of medium- andlong-term loans to Brazil.    The company added that it expects first quarter 1987earnings to be "down moderately" from year-earlier levels.    "Continued suspension of interest payments on the medium-and long-term debt could result in such loans being classifiedas nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual," it said.    However, it added its belief that it was "premature todecide at this time" whether to reclassify the loans.    Brazil announced Feb. 20 that it was temporarily suspendinginterest payments on all its medium- and long-term foreign bankdebt.    Marine Midland said its total Brazil outstandings as of theend of 1986 were 653 mln dlrs, including 359 mln dlrs ofmedium- and long-term loans and 294 mln dlrs of short-termoutstandings.    As of Dec. 31, it had interest receivable of about five mlndlrs on its medium- and long-term Brazil outstandings.    If debt restructuring talks between Brazil and its creditorbanks are not completed by the end of the third quarter, thecompany estimated Brazil's action would reduce its net incomefor the year by about 22 mln dlrs.    In the first quarter of 1986, Marine Midland reported record earnings of 38.2 mln dlrs, bolstered by certainnon-recurring securities gains.    It said it expected lower first quarter 1987 earningsbecause the money market cost of funds had increased, "narrowingnet interest spreads somewhat." It said the earnings projectionwas based on "preliminary" 1987 data. Reuter&#3;
