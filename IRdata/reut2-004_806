Soviet livestock herds are possiblyin better shape than expected after the recent harsh winter,the U.S. agriculture counselor in Moscow said.    Livestock procurement levels for January and February wererecently reported in a Soviet agriculture newspaper to be upfive pct from year ago levels, an attache report said.    "These procurement levels ... are surprisingly normal giventhe harshness of the 1986/87 winter ... indicating neitherabnormal distress slaughter nor subnormal livestock productoutput. While the overwintering period is not over yet, theworst of it is, and herds are possibly in better shape thanexpected," the counselor said.    A healthy livestock sector will keep Soviet feed demand strong and impact USSR grain imports, analysts said.    January livestock procurement levels were up only 1.6 pct,indicating a turn around in February, an Agriculture Departmentanalyst of the Soviet Union said.    The analyst said an easing of the cold weather in February,coupled with heavy amounts of grain fed to the animals wouldaccount for the rise in procurements.    "There's no question that the (Soviet) livestock is in goodshape," he said. Reuter&#3;
