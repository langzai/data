The House should override PresidentReagan's veto of the 88 billion dlr highway construction billtoday by a comfortable margin, House Speaker Jim Wright said.    "We have counted and feel comfortable," Wright said. And headded, there may be 100 Republicans joining most Democrats inthe Democratic-controlled House to override by the necessarytwo-thirds margin.  "If that's the case it'll be a verycomfortable override," he told reporters.    The outlook in the Senate is less certain and Wright saidthat it will depend on whether senators "stay true to theirconvictions or cave in to White House pressure." Reuter&#3;
