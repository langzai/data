World Bank President Barber Conableshould prod the government of President Suharto towards furthereconomic change, the Jakarta Post newspaper said.    "Conable could do Indonesia a great service if he isstraightforward enough to point his finger at shortcomings thatcould be corrected," it said in an editorial.    The English-language paper said the bureacracy was notaggressive or imaginative in responding to Indonesia's economicproblems, which include fiscal restraints due to drasticallydeclining oil revenues, increasing unemployment, and marketingproblems for its major export commodities.    The paper said Indonesia must boost the scope for privatebusiness initiative as well as stepping up its use of aid moneyalready committed. The World Bank has lent Indonesia 10.7billion dlrs over the past 20 years.    Conable arrived here on Saturday and will have talks withSuharto tomorrow. Today he was returning to Jakarta from avisit to World Bank-funded projects in eastern Java, and wasscheduled to meet leading economic ministers in the afternoon.    Western diplomats said they expected Conable to pressIndonesia to maintain the pace of its present economic reformsto cope with the slump in its oil revenues. REUTER&#3;
