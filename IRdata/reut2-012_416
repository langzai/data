Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> said newproposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of amerged telecommunications firm to compete fortelecommunications contracts did not remove the group'sobjections.    The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisationsofficial Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposalsmade earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.    Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying tocompete against Japan's &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> whichmonopolises Japan's overseas telephone business.    But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger ofthe two consortia would be impracticable. "They are like oil andwater," he said.    The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and haveproposed that the two consortia band together. The issue hasbeen taken up by the British government as a test case on theopenness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals saidthat the eight core companies of the new group should haveequal share holdings but added that they could work out theprecise percentages amongst themselves.    The reports earlier this week said that Cable would beoffered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed threepct.    Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, theCable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentiallythe same.    Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at374p.
