Group Group Inc said it has delayedthe distribution of the common shares of its Grow Ventures Corpsubsidiary scheduled for today.    The company said the spinoff, which is subject to requiredfilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and otherconditions, has been delayed due to the commission's heavyworkload, which has not permitted a review of Grow Group'sfilings.    As soon as these filings are processed by the SEC a newdistribution date will be announced, the company said. Reuter&#3;
