A Treasury official said there are noplans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuingyen-denominated bonds that would become known as "Reagan bonds."    "It simply isn't something that we are planning to do," theofficial said.    He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reportssuggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds asthe former Carter administration did when it sold "Carter bonds"denominated in West German marks.    But he said the situation was greatly different now.    "If you look at the differences between the treasury marketnow and in the Carter administration years, it is a much moreglobal market now," the official said.    "There was not the same ease then for the holder of anothercurrency to buy other countries' securities," he added, "Butthere is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buyU.S. securities."    The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to payits debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issueyen-denominated bonds, he emphasized. Reuter&#3;
