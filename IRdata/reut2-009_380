Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigesaid the United States will not stand idly by and let Japandominate the world electronics market.    Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the UnitedStates would insist Japan open its markets to U.S. products asthe U.S. market is open to Japanese products.    Asked after his testimony if this meant the United Stateswould close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs,Baldrige said, "I'm not prepared to say that, but it certainlywould be one of the alternatives studied."    Baldrige said in his testimony Japan had a closedsupercomputer market and a restricted telecommunicationsmarket.    "I can only conclude that the common objective of theJapanese government and industry is to dominate the worldelectronics market. Given the importance of this market to U.S.industry in general and our defense base in particular, wecannot stand by idly," he said.    He said it was these concerns about national security whichled him to express reservations over the proposed acquisitionof Fairchild Semiconductor by Fujitsu of Japan. Reuter&#3;
