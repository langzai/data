Four new outsiders were appointed to thepolicy-making Council of the Lloyd's of London insurancemarket, shifting the voting balance on the Council away fromLloyd's professionals, Lloyd's said.    It said in a statement the appointments of the new members,none of them previously involved in the insurance market, weremade to comply with the core recommendation in the Neill reportinto regulation at Lloyd's, which was published on January 22.    The recommendation, one of 70 to improve investorprotection in the Lloyd's market, was to reduce the number ofelected working members, Lloyd's professionals, from 16 to 12.    Simultaneously, the number of outsiders would be increasedby four while the number of external Council members, usuallyLloyd's investors without an active role in the market, wouldremain unchanged at eight. Lloyd's said the four newly-appointed Council members werebarrister Elizabeth Mary Freeman, Sir Maurice Hodgson,non-executive chairman of British Home Stores Plc, Lloyd's BankPlc chairman Sir Jeremy Morse, and Brian Pomeroy, an accountantwho sat on the three-member Neill enquiry panel.    They replace the four Lloyd's professionals who resigned onApril 4 after Lloyd's agreed to implement the recommendation. REUTER&#3;
