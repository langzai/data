Valero Natural Gas PartnersLP, 49 pct owned by Valero Energy Corp &lt;VLO>, said a jury inSutton County, Texas, district court has found that it had noliability for 21 mln dlrs in take-or-pay claims that had beenalleged by Lively Exploration Co.    Take-or-pay claims involve allegations that natural gassupply contracts require volume of natural gas to be paid foreven if not taken. As a result of declining markets, mostpipelines, like Valero, do not have customers for all the gasthat could be delivered by producers, such as Lively.    Valero said it used as its primary defense the TexasRailroad Commission's rules that require intrastate pipelinesto take ratably from their producers and in times of surplustake gas in accordance with priority categories set by thecommission.
