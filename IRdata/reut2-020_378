Den Norske Creditbank (DNC) &lt;NCBO.OL>,Norway's biggest commercial bank, said it boosted its profitsin 1987's first eight months by 32.3 pct after vigorouslycutting loan losses and operating costs.    The bank showed a 300 mln crown net profit after provisionsfor losses and taxes in the period ending on August 31, againsta 203 mln crown profit in the same year-ago period, it said.    DNC's biggest gains were seen in the domestic market, butsome of its foreign exchange and securities units have been hitby sharply higher interest rates for the dollar and resultsremained unsatisfactory, it added.    Total assets rose to 132 billion crowns from 107.6 billion.    Although the group's operating profit dropped to 875 mlncrowns compared with 986 mln a year-ago, the loss was counteredby reducing the need to set aside capital to cover loan losses,it added.    "In 1986 DNC made substantial provisions for potential loanlosses, particularly in the oil and shipping sectors...The needfor write-offs in these sectors has now been substantiallyreduced," the bank said.    DNC, with extensive exposure in the oil industry, was hardhit by plunging crude prices last year. REUTER&#3;
