A bill that would impose an oilimport fee to support a world floor price for oil of 25 dlrs abarrel was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by12 Congressmen from oil-producing states.    The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices riseabove 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said.    Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oilfrom stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day orless - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. Purchases wouldstop when prices rose above that level.    "Time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry,"Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said in a statement. "An oil importfee is really just the premium for a national insurancepolicy."    President Reagan opposes an oil import fee, but supportersof the bill said they hoped for action on it before the end ofthe year. Reuter&#3;
