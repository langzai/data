Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saidthe U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese tradebarriers and warned that it would soon have new powers againstcountries not offering reciprocal access to their markets.    She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable andWireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunicationsmarket was being regarded by her government as a test case.    "I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on thefourth of March to express our interest on the Cable andWireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a teston how open the Japanese market really is," Thatcher said.    Thatcher told Parliament that "shortly ... We shall havemore powers than we have now, when, for example the powersunder the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act becomeavailable, then we shall be able to take action in cases whereother countries do not offer the same full access to financialservices as we do."    Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposedJapanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa.    But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunicationswas reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wirelesshaving a managerial role in the new company. REUTER&#3;
