&lt;Dixons Group PLC> said it received aletter on March 19 from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd, part ofthe Cyacq investor group making a rival bid for Cyclops Corp&lt;CYL>, proposing to drop the group's offer if Dixons would sellCyclops industrial businesses to Citicorp.    "Cyacq's main equity investor appears ready to pull out anddeal directly with us for merely part of the company" saidDixons. "It raises questions as to the strength of theirconsortium and the purpose of their offer."    Dixons also said a U.S. Federal Court had refused a requestby counsel for Cyacq, Audio/Video Affiliates Inc &lt;AVA> and ashareholder plaintiff to prevent Dixons fromcompleting its tender offer for Cyclops. It also said the courtrefused to require Cyclops to provide Cyacq with confidentialinformation previously provided to Dixons.    On Friday Cyacq Corp, an investor group led by Audio/VideoAffiliates and Citicorp, raised their offer for Cyclops to92.50 dlrs per share from 80 dlrs per share, if certainconditions were satisfied.    Last week Dixons said it won out over rival bidders forCyclops after getting 54 pct of Cyclop's oustanding with a90.25 dlr or 384 mln dlr tender offer that expired March 18.    On Friday, Dixons agreed to reopen its tender offer untilMarch 25, Wednesday.    Dixons today called Cyacq's higher 92.50 dlr a share offerfor Cyclops "highly conditional." Reuter&#3;
