Banner Industries Inc said a judge ofthe U.S. District Court in Chicago ruled that Banner mustresolve its pension fund dispute in arbitration rather than infederal court.    The court's ruling stems from a lawsuit Banner filed infederal court last May seeking a ruling that it is not liableto the Central States Fund for about 20 mln dlrs in pensionwithdrawal liability payments.    Banner said the district court reserved ruling on whetherit must pay about five mln dlrs that the Central Fund claims isowed in back-due interim payments. Reuter&#3;
