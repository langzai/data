Howard told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets"I want to see an agreement between us on what progress is to bemade and the rate at which it will happen."    Japanese vice-minister of finance for international affairsToyoo Gyohten told the conference yesterday he was ready todiscuss capital adequacy, but no negotiations were planned andhe could not see how or when agreement would be reached.    Howard said another issue he would raise during a visit toJapan, starting on April 13, was equal access for U.K.Financial firms to the Japanese market.    He said 14 London-based financial firms were based inTokyo, nine of them wholly British, with licences to deal insecurities. This compared with 58 wholly-licensed Japanesefirms in London.    "I am not a protectionist. We welcome all these firms here.But I want our firms to be able to compete just as freely inJapan and at the moment they are not allowed to do so," he said. REUTER&#3;
