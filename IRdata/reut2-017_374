West German use of tapioca is likely todecline further despite favourable prices and import licencesfor only 420,000 tonnes have been registered since the start ofthe current agricultural year, compared with 640,000 tonnesduring August/April the previous year, trade sources said.    The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed atotal of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier periodthe EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said.    The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences toaround 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, theysaid.    Total EC tapioca imports during the current agriculturalyear are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said.    They reported a rise in consumption and in import licencesfor France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compoundfeed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures.    Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27marks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks inApril last year.    Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos,resulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demandwas seen as slack.    The sources said the West German feed industry was tryingto help cut the grain surplus through increased use of grain infeed mixtures.    Other EC member countries are likely to take advantage ofthe lower tapioca prices, they said. REUTER&#3;
