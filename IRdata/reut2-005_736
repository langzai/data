The Kobe Rubber Exchange said it willextend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators touse the exchange.    Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industryapproval, the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at1700 local time, and will close the account for trading at thenew session the following day before the opening call starts at0930 local time, an Exchange official said.    Trading on the Singapore rubber market, a major producerprice indicator for Japanese end-users, is usually active afterthe end of the current final session here.    The introduction of the new session will enableparticipants to trade overnight after taking account ofSingapore rubber prices, because brokers and members who aredesignated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volumetraded overnight to the new final session before the openingsession starts next day, the official said.    But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system whichsets a fixed price at each session, the price of contractstraded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixthsession, he added.    Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approvethe plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futuresindustry to expand and internationalise.    The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry, TOCOM, whichalso trades rubber futures in Japan, said it has no plans tointroduce an extra session.    TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day. Foursessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions,but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time. REUTER&#3;
