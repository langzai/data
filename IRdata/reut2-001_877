A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecucoins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministryspokesman said.    Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be soldfrom the same day. The spokesman told Reuters the price forthese would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likelyto be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.    At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds ofthousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. They willbe sold both in Belgium and abroad.    The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu,the "basket" comprised of the 12-nation European Community'scurrencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo.    The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of theEC's founding Treaty of Rome this month. Finance Minister MarkEyskens, who currently presides over the EC's council ofeconomic and finance ministers, has called the issue apolitical act of symbolic value which aimed to make theCommunity's goal of monetary integration more concrete.    The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demandis expected to come from coin collectors. REUTER&#3;
