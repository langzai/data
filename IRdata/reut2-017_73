Long-term bank sources confirmed theirbanks have decided to leave the current 5.2 pct long-term primerate unchanged.    The current rate has been in effect since March 28.    The bankers said the rate was unchanged because the fallingdollar and the bond market rally made it difficult to clarifythe current level of yen interest rates.    There had earlier this week been expectations of a 0.2point cut from today in response to the fall in the secondarymarket yield in five-year long-term bank debentures, butbankers said last night the rate would be unchanged.
