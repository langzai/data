Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid the export enhancement program (eep) could be funded fromthe Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) if the one billion dlrsappropriated for export bonus by Congress is exhausted.    Lyng told reporters lack of funding should not be aconstraint on the program because USDA has the authority to useCCC funds to continue the program. He noted Congress authorizedup to 1.5 billion dlrs for eep.    Earlier this week, Leo Mayer, associate administrator ofUSDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, said 865 mln dlrs of theone billion in appropriated funds for eep have been used. USDAofficials said if all the eep offers announced are accepted byimporting countries the one billion dlrs would be exhaustedsoon.    Some Congressional sources have expressed concern that theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) might try to block USDAfrom seeking more than the one billion dlrs appropriated forthe program.    These sources suggested the lack of funds might force USDAto halt the program, which some commodity groups believe hasgiven a boost to U.S. exports of some farm products,particularly wheat and wheat flour.    However, Lyng's comments seemed to suggest that USDA couldat least temporarily continue the program using CCC funds andwould not be forced to curtail eep. Reuter&#3;
