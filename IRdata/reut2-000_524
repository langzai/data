Talks at the extended special meeting ofthe International Coffee Organization (ICO) on thereintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances ofsuccess were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.    Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombianproposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September,with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a newquota system would be calculated in September for the new cropyear, they said.    Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching aquota agreement varied widely.    Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightlymore optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any ofits traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share lookslikely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.    No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative hadbeen tabled formally today, delegates said.    A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for aprogress report, delegates said. Reuter&#3;
