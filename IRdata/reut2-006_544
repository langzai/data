The DIW economic research institutesaid West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reachthe 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic thanthose of the other four leading German institutes, said theeconomy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and itsprospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross nationalproduct (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract inreal, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarterof last year.     The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in theremaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand andproduction would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to1.5 pct.    Other institutes and economists have recently revised theirforecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.    In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists thatthe economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demandhealthy but foreign demand weak.    DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand forcapital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumergoods, not between foreign and domestic demand.    It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had beenhit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which hadcaused West German firms to scale back investment plans.    Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, werecontinuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,it said.    In a separate report the HWWA economic research institutein Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fallmarkedly this year.    However, the nominal trade surplus would show little changefrom 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a furtherimprovement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 comparedwith 1986, it said.
