Canada Post presented its strikingletter carriers with a new contract offer today but both sidessaid there was little indication the offer would end anincreasingly violent three-day-old walkout.    The strike has been especially bitter in Quebec, where thefederally regulated postal service has brought in replacementworkers in contravention of provincial laws that prohibithiring strikebreakers.    Canada Post said letter carriers in Chicoutimi andJonquiere, Quebec, damaged mail sorting rooms, ripped outtelephone lines and letter racks, overturned furniture andthrew mail on the floor before walking out to join carriers inother cities on the picket line.    The rotating strike spread today to the Atlantic provincesand Vancouver. Carriers remained off the job in Edmonton andVancouver while postal employees went back to work in Montreal,Calgary, and Cornwall, Ontario.    About 20 people were arrested in Eastern Canada as strikersscuffled with police called in to escort replacement workersacross picket lines.    Letter Carriers Union of Canada President Robert McGarrysaid the new offer to the union's 20,000 members contained onlyminor changes and did not soften the agency's demand forconcessions.    Canada Post officials said the agency is limited by federalguidlines which order the agency to eliminate its 160 mln dlrsdeficit by next year. Reuter&#3;
