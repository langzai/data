Liberalization of Italy's foreign exchangecontrols should be "gradual" but also "reasonably rapid," a reportissued by a study committee nominated by the Italian TreasuryMinistry said.   The report, looking at the country's financial developmentprospects, said Italy's large public sector deficit and growingpublic debt were among the considerations that made a gradualliberalization preferable.    The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pctoscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) duringthe liberalization process in order to lessen short-termdomestic interest rate fluctuations which could result fromportfolio adjustments.    The lira's fluctuation margin is currently significantlyhigher than that allowed for other EMS currencies.    Italy has over recent months announced a series ofderegulation moves in response to a European Communitydirective aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods,services and finance by 1992.
