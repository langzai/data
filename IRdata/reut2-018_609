Gillette Co said Revlon Group made anunsolicited request, asking the Gillette board to allow Revlonto make a cash offer for all Gillette shares of at least 40.50dlrs per share.    Gillette said consent for the bid is required under astandstill agreement between Revlon and Gillette before Revloncan make any move on Gillette's stock.    In November 1986, Revlon made an unsolicited offer forGillette shares, Gillette said.    Subsequently, Revlon withdrew its offer, sold back toGillette the shares it owned at that time and entered into thestandstill agreement.    The Gillette board of directors has a regularly scheduledmeeting this afternoon, and Gillette said it anticipates makinga statement after that meeting. Reuter&#3;
