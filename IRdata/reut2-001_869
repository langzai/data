The Bank of Spain said it raised thereserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct ofdeposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatenedmoney supply and inflation targets.    In a statement issued late last night, the central banksaid the measure would take effect from March 13.    "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in theSpanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten themonetary and inflation targets set by the government," thestatement said.    Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserverequirement allowed by law is 20 pct.    The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in theBank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now standsat 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left therate unchanged.    Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-basedliquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.    Banking sources said that although the January money supplyfigures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pctin December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appearedto have accelerated in February, raising government concern.    Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested thatprices were under control.    Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel FernandezOrdonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate forFebruary, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct fromsix pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.
