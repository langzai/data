Treasury Secretary JamesBaker said any further decline in the dollar against othercurrencies would be counterproductive.    Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American EconomicLeadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of PresidentReagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he couldsee some further decline in the dollar within reason.    "All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline inthe dollar would be counterproductive," Baker told reporters.    Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the WhiteHouse clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying thatthe United States wants a stable dollar.    The main incentive for the United States to favor a weakerdollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit,but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months andappears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollaragainst the yen and the mark during the past two years.
