The south China province of Guangdong isimporting millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas andother parts of China because farmers have switched from grainto more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.    The official magazine said the province's grain area fellto 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of atotal farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.    Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in partto supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, themagazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.    The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of nationalfarmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct underother crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.    It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity andlow productivity make grain the least profitable farmcommodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuanfrom cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.    It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted onlygradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system. REUTER&#3;
