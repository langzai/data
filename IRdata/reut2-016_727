Sri Lanka and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) have reached agreement on the broad outlineof economic reforms, but tough negotiations are likely beforethe IMF approves up to 240 mln dlrs in loans, a senior financeministry official told Reuters.    He said the government and IMF this week agreed on apackage to reduce the balance of payments deficit, improvemanagement of public enterprises, reform tariffs, developnon-traditional exports and privatise public firms.    An IMF-World Bank team will visit Colombo next month tostart negotiations on details of a three-year economic reformprogramme. "There is a broad agreement on the content of thepolicy package for a structural reform," the official said. "Butin areas where the reform would take place, there would betough neotiations on how much you do and in what order shouldit take place," he added.    Sri Lanka is seeking a total of about 240 mln dlrs instructural adjustment loans to support the balance of paymentsand in a compensatory financing facility to offset losses incommodity exports.    Sri Lanka needs the IMF and World Bank approval of the twofacilities to clear the way for negotiations on requests foraid and loans from donor countries.    These include an expected pledge of 550 mln dlrs from from12 industrialised countries and about 240 mln dlrs in loansfrom the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.    Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel said in an interviewpublished today by the Daily News that there was likelihood ofSri Lanka obtaining all of that aid despite intense lobbying bypro-Tamil and human rights groups abroad.    He said that although friendly countries were stillprepared to assist Sri Lanka with concessional aid, Colombowould have to surmount many problems in detailed negotiationsdue in May, June and August before these loans are finalised.    "In these matters, there's many a slip between the cup andthe lip as other governments have learned to their cost," De Melsaid. REUTER&#3;
