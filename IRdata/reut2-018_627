Atlantic Richfield Co, considering aspin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, couldgain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analystsestimated.    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points onrumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based onabout 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy wasvaluing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statementaround mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct ofthe unit, leading investors to take profits.    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.    "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhatdisappointing," said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. Hesaid rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple ofdays."    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn'tgetting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and itsvalue was not reflected in the company's stock price.    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein saidthe unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year andhe expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena sayschemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth aboutthree billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500to 600 mln dlrs.    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stakebecause chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated thecompany would use the proceeds to pay down debt.    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fallthrough. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet beenpresented to its board.    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billiondlrs.    Reuter&#3;
