The World Bank has suspended loans to Perubecause the country has over two months of payment arrears withthe lending agency, central bank general manager Hector Neyrasaid.     He told reporters the government decided to stop payingthe World Bank because scheduled repayments outweighed theloans it was due to receive.     The measure was the latest hard-line debt stance adoptedby the government of President Alan Garcia, one of LatinAmerica's most delinquent debtors. The 22-month-oldadministration has cut repayments to 10 pct of export earningson nearly all its 14.4 billion dlr foreign debt.     Neyra said since late 1986 Peru had sought an accomodationwith the World Bank under which it would receive more creditsthan it would remit in repayments.     Neyra stressed Peru was not withdrawing from the worldbank. The country had recently increased its capitalsuscription in the institution by about three mln dollars.    The Bank would immediately resume loan disbursements toPeru once it cleared its arrears, he said. He did not specifythe value of the overdue payments. The economy ministry saidPeru's debt to the world bank was 521 mln dlrs at end-1985.    At the end of last year, Peru's total foreign debt stood at14.46 billion dollars, 13.17 billion dollars of which ismedium- and-long-term debt, the central bank said. Totalarrears were 5.42 billion dollars.    Central bank president Leonel Figueroa said Peru had enoughhard currency, gold and silver on hand to cover 10 or 11months' worth of imports.    The holdings of the two precious metals and the hardcurrencies were valued at 2.172 billion dlrs on May 22, 1987,he said.    Gross reserves were slightly lower at 1.857 billion dlrsbecause this classification did not include silver holdings andundervalued the central bank's gold.    Reserves were projected to fall at most 150 mln dlrs thisyear, he said. Reuter&#3;
