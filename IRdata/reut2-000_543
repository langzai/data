It will include recording additional trade data, checking,comparison and matching any new elements but will only applyinitially to delivery against payment transactions, AIBD said.    The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible fordeveloping suitable rules to back up the two clearing systemswhen they introduce their new matching matching facilities andconfirmation systems by September this year.
