Hilton Hotels Corp said it receivedapproval from Federal court to sue the Internal Revenue Serviceto determine if the IRS was correct in allowing the ConradHilton Foundation to hold certain stocks.    That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation, set up bythe late Conrad Hilton, to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp,worth approximately 164 mln dlrs, according to Hiltonattorneys.    Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchasethose 6,782,000 shares, the company said.    However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, theFoundation changed its tax status from a private foundation toa public support organization, freeing it from the constraintsof the excess business holdings limitations imposed on privatefoundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to theHilton Corp.    That act said that a private foundation could not own morethan 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything overthat figure had to be sold.    The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the lawrequired that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct ofthe common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will,Barron had the option to buy the seven pct,  according to theHilton lawyers.    Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the taxlaw, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct blockof stock. The Hilton lawyers explained that Barron wasattempting to keep the large block from going public, leavingthe family in control of the corporation.    Reuter&#3;
