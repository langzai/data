A partisan battle over PresidentReagan's veto of an 88-billion dlr highway bill resumes in theSenate today after an apparent victory for the White House wasleft in doubt when a key Democrat switched his vote     The Senate yesterday had voted to sustain Reagan's veto bya narrow margin, but Democrats moved to reconsider the vote.Terry Sanford of North Carolina, the only Democrat to supportReagan, later said he had decided to vote to override when thebill is reconsidered.    If no other votes switch, the Senate would override theveto on reconsideration, Senate Republican leader Robert Doleof Kansas said. He said Reagan and Administration officialswould continue to lobby for votes to sustain the veto.    "As of right now, the vote would be 67 to 33 (in favor ofthe bill) and the veto would be overriden," Dole said.     After several hours of delay, Senate leaders were unable toagree on a time for a second vote and the Senate recessed untilthis morning with the issue unresolved.    Sanford denied he had been pressured to change his vote,but told the Senate, "I have talked to and have been talked toby a number of senators. I have thought a little more deeplyabout this vote."    The first Senate vote put Reagan on the verge of apolitical triumph he had sought to show he is reboundingstrongly from the Iran arms scandal.&#3;
