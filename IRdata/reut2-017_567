Representatives of major U.K. Based banksare meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing thecost of financing British exports guaranteed by the ExportCredits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sourcessaid.    The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGDand the Bank of England.    Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment onthe plan. However, bankers said one of the main points underdiscussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's mediumterm credit portfolio in the international capital markets.    The proposals involve introducing a set of interest marginson ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the sizeand maturity of the credit and the currency.    The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankerssaid that while these rates would reduce a bank's return theywould still be more than those proposed about a year ago whenthe government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate anothercost reduction plan.    At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow theECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existinggovernment backed credit in the capital markets.    On credits that are refinanced an original lender wouldreceive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mlnstg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions. REUTER&#3;
