European Community (EC) member stateshave generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals bythe European Commission for cereal price changes and relatedmeasures in the coming season, EC diplomats said.    They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee onAgriculture representatives of most member states had said thechanges, taken together, would have too harsh an impact onfarmers' incomes.    Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness toaccept the commission's overall package, they said.    As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for mostcereals, the commission proposes a limitation of interventionto the February to March period and reduced monthly incrementsin intervention prices.    EC Farm Ministers will have a first discussion of theproposals at a meeting beginning next Monday. Reuter&#3;
