Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe United States and other nations were willing to cooperateto stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existedat the time of an international agreement last month.    "Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to theParis Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadlyconsistent with underlying economic conditions," Baker told aSenate committee.    Baker continued, "We said further that we and others arewilling to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchangerates around those levels."    He referred to a February agreement by six leadingindustrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters.    Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan andGermany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economiesfor the United States to support the dollar.    "I will not comment because the foreign exchange marketreads more or less than is intended in my statements," Bakersaid.    Baker said that the other signatories recognized that theymust carry their share of the load of correcting externalimbalances that have hindered the world's economy.    He cited news reports that Germany would increase aproposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks tostimulate domestic growth.    Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures afterthe Japanese budget was made final.    Baker said those nations were stimulating their economiesin a manner consistent with gains against inflation. Reuter&#3;
