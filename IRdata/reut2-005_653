Consul Restaurant Corp chief financialofficer Robert Lamp told analysts a previously announcedconversion offer will reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to 55 pctfrom 380 pct, assuming full acceptance of the offer.    As of November 30, the company had about 26 mln dlrs oftotal debt outstanding.    Earlier, Consul said it would exchange 174,912 shares ofconvertible preferred stock for 17.5 mln dlrs of outstanding 13pct debentures.    Lamp said that excess debt due to its withdrawal from theTexas marketplace has been the key factor to blocking furtherprogress.    The Mexican restaurant franchisee reported a net loss of415,493 dlrs for the six months ended November 30, 1986.    Acceptance of exchange offer by 90 pct of the debentureholders will enable Consul to decrease its outstandingindebtedness and report profitably beginning in the firstquarter of 1988, Lamp told analysts.
