Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone saidJapan plans to work out a drastic set of pump-priming measuresimmediately after Parliament passes the 1987/88 budget.    He told a Lower House budget committee the government islikely to consider a supplementary budget for fiscal 1987 and anew policy for the ceiling on budgetary requests by governmentagencies and ministries for 1988/89.    The government had cut budgetary requests in the past fiveyears in line with Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction policy ofstopping the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.    The passage of the budget is expected in late May.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in the same sessionJapan should use fiscal funds as much as possible to meetdomestic and foreign demands for greater domestic growth.    Miyazawa said it appears difficult for the government tostop the deficit-financing bond issues by the targetted time.    Nakasone said he had instructed his Liberal DemocraticParty to prepare its own economic package in time for hisone-week visit to Washington starting on April 29. REUTER&#3;
