S and W Berisford Plc &lt;BRFD.L> said a sixpct rise in pretax profits to 42.7 mln stg in the first halfhad maintained last year's momentum despite poor commoditiestrading conditions and continued rationalisation costs.    Its British Sugar Corp Plc unit produced its best everperformance due to greater efficiency and better selling pricesand was on course for record full year profits.    In the last year Berisford attempted to sell the unit andattracted several bids. A bid by Hillsdown Holdings Plc&lt;HLDN.L> was abandoned, one from Tate and Lyle Plc &lt;TATL.L>officially blocked and a sale of BSC to &lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi> alsoprevented.    It had authorised a further 46 mln stg in capitalexpenditure in BSC for next year, eight mln higher than theanticipated total this year.    Berisford said it was particularly pleased with theprogress of its associate Hunter Saphir Plc, in which itacquired a substantial equity stake in January in return forthe sale of some of its food manufacturing companies.    Since the deal was completed, the market value of the stakein Hunter had almost doubled and at the same time enabled thegroup to concentrate efforts in its food division oningredients -- mainly sugar, gelatine and flavours.    The property division maintained good growth whilefinancial services made a satisfactory contribution to profits.However, the results of the industrial division continued to bedisappointing although the rationalisation programme wasprogressing well.    Commodity operations returned to profit after a second halfloss last year. The results reflected dull market conditions,with coffee trading failing to repeat last year's exceptionalfirst half performance due to extremely difficult conditions inworld markets.    It said it was reducing its exposure to the volatility ofcommodity earnings by concentrating on a smaller range of keycommodities.    Berisford shares firmed one penny on the announcement to366p.
