The Supreme Court declined to reviewa federal regulation requiring automobile manufacturers tophase in automatic seat belts or air bags for new cars sold inthe United States.    The Department of Transportation (DOT) rule required thatthe safety devices be installed, for the first time, on 10 pctof this year's model cars. All new cars must have the devicesby the 1990-model year.    The regulation, however, can be rescinded if states withtwo-thirds of the U.S. population adopt mandatory seat belt-uselaws by 1989.
