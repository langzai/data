The Washington Post said the U.S.Commerce Department yesterday issued a new report showing thatthe U.S. Merchandise trade deficit was 13.65 billion dollars inFebruary, a reduction of 1.4 billion dlrs from the 15.06billion figure the department reported only two days earlier.    The newspaper said: "News of the unexpectedly large 15billion deficit helped batter the dollar's value on foreignexchange markets and boosted U.S. Interest rates.    "However, the new report went largely unnoticed by financialmarkets since such a downward revision in the deficit is amonthly occurrence."    The Washington Post said: "By law, the department must firstpublish what a top commerce official agreed are misleadingtrade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out themore accurate ones."
