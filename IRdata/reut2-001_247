The specialty retailing area continuesto pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five anddime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases forthe New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 yearsago.    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrsper share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrsper share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion comparedwith the prior year's 5.96 billion.    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters thatincome generated by the company's specialty store operationsaccounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty storesoperating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, itoperated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated byWoolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richmanapparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chainof discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discountdrug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, ofwhich 1,200 are in the United States.    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying asthey are an improvement over last year's record earnings."    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings ineach quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlierperiod.    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount storeindustry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworthopened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the UnitedStates, although Woolco still operates in Canada.    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy andannounced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square footthan general merchandise stores.    Reuter&#3;
