Pennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtkesaid the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc &lt;TX> to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil andthat a settlement was "in the best interests of bothcompanies."    Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders,said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recentpublic statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settlingthe case.    "Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both beforeand after trial, to settle this dispute," Liedtke said in theletter. "We do not know why Texaco's officials would now makesuch clearly untrue statements."    Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a juryjudgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's planto acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by twobillion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awardedto Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed thetotal amount back above 10 billion dlrs.    Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactoryproposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.    "Other than to put on the record that it has made offers,Texaco's proposals make no sense," Liedtke said in the letter."In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and wereproposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would notaccept."    The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers madeby either Pennzoil or Texaco.    "If and when Texaco's management changes its position anddemonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt tosettle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort tocooperate," Liedtke said. "Such a solution, I believe, isclearly in the interests of both companies, even if it notattractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management anddirectors."    Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets andprofits from those assets that have since been sold"approximately equaled" Texaco's purchase price of 10 billiondlrs for Getty.
