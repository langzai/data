A  teachers' strike has spreadfrom Lusaka to the whole of Zambia, and a walkout by nurses hasvirtually paralyzed hospitals in the northern Copperbelt, thestate-owned Zambia Daily Mail newspaper said today.    The teachers and nurses are demanding hefty pay raises,including a 50 pct increase in basic salary. But their strikeaction is unofficial, and the government has condemned thestoppages, warning that they could lead to violence.    The strikes broke out only three months after food riots inthe Copperbelt last December, which left 15 people dead.    The stoppages began on Wednesday when 1,000 teachers inLusaka and 200 nurses in the northern town of Kitwe decided towalk out in support of pay demands. Reuter&#3;
