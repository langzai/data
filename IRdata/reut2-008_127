Australian opposition leader John Howardsacked from the shadow cabinet Andrew Peacock, who is a formerforeign minister and Howard's predecessor, party officialssaid.    The officials said the move could lead to the collapse ofthe opposition coalition between the Liberal and Nationalparties, which has been under severe strain in recent weeks.    In a television interview yesterday prime minister BobHawke said he might call an early election if strife within theopposition undermined business confidence and hurt Australia'seconomic recovery.    "The opposition have not only destabilised themselves, theyhave prostituted the political and economic debate by puttingup economic nostrums and stupidities that are destabilizingbusiness confidence," Hawke said.    Howard relegated Peacock to the back benches after theMelbourne Sun published an alleged telephone conversationbetween Peacock and another opposition member in which Peacockwas critical of Howard's leadership. The paper said the callwas recorded by an unidentified man using an electronic radioscanner. In a statement Howard said the conversation wasdamaging to the party and implied disloyalty to him.    Peacock told reporters he accepted Howard's right to "hireand fire." He refused to answer questions about any leadershipchallenge.    Liberal party officials said the move against Peacock couldencourage his supporters to mount a challenge to Howard'sleadership. Peacock was ousted as opposition leader by Howardin September 1985, after losing the 1984 general election toHawke.    Queensland premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, a veteranNational Party member, recently campaigned against Howard'sleadership and urged his party to split from the coalition. REUTER&#3;
