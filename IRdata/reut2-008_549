Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> islikely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operatingprofits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains inits aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.    Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits fromoperations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrscompared with 1.23 billion in 1985.    They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain ofabout 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its CathayPacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May.    Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.    Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividendfor its "A" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 centsadjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.    Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of thecompany's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,analysts said.    The company's aviation division consists of its majoritystake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in&lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pctowned by Cathay.    Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuelcosts and greater traffic.    Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before theflotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and hassince slipped to 50.23 pct.    Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profitsrose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.    Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.    "Much depends on properties," said Measor. "And they did a lotbetter in the second half of the year."    Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned SwireProperties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mlncompared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.    Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrsfor the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for thesame 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to thelow level of completion of new residential flats. The firm'sproperties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residentialdevelopment and two luxury housing projects.    Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats inTaikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs insecond-half 1986.    During the year property prices continued to rise as morepeople bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,analysts said.    "At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were sellingat 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a yearago," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)Ltd.    Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex inthe central business district of Hong Kong but it will notprovide income until the first stage is completed next year.    The company also sold three properties and a part interestin a proposed hotel development, which should result inextraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to JamesCapel (Far East) Ltd.    Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expectedto earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping andoffshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.
