Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil)&lt;STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billioncrowns with two domestic yards, the company said in astatement.    Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner IndustrierA/S &lt;KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convertStatoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floatingproduction platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixedwell-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.    Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S&lt;AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build thewell-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to standin 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.    Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than afixed platform would cut construction time, enabling fieldpartners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- severalmonths earlier than previously planned.    Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mlnbarrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 kmwest of Bergen.    Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily outputis 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.    Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Osebergfield pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gaswill be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas fromNorway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.    Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55pct share, &lt;Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), &lt;Deminex (Norge) A/S>(13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL> (nine pct) and &lt;SvenskaPetroleum AB> (4.5 pct).
