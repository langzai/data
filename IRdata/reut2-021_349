Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin toldthe Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned torise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.    In the first nine months of this year, industrial outputrose by 3.6 pct.    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pctagainst a planned 4.1 pct this year.    He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.    The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected theharvest this year.    Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineeringindustry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedas a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if theSoviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires," saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of thisyear against the same period of 1986. This is well below the7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.

"Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources," he said.
