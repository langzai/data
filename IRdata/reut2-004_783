Markus Lusser, vice-president of theSwiss National Bank, said he was sceptical of the recentU.S.-British accord on joint bank supervision, fearing smallercountries could be forced to cooperate.    In a speech prepared for delivery to a meeting of WestGerman savings banks, he said such an accord would cover thethree most important financial centres of the world if extendedto Japan as planned.    "Countries not prepared to cooperate with an agreement ofthe group of three could easily be put under pressure," Lussersaid.    "It would be enough to forbid banks the right to make use ofthose financial markets or to place them under a specialstatus," he added.    Banks which operate worldwide could scarcely afford to stayaway from these centres and would place their nationalgovernments under pressure to conform.    Lusser added that he was opposed to the form, though notthe content of the accord. Switzerland itself was not affected,since capital adequacy requirements here were already stricterthan in Britain or the United States. But he feared suchaccords might be substituted for internationally negotiatedpacts. REUTER&#3;
