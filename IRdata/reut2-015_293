The value of U.S. farmland declinedagain last year, but less than in the previous year, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In a summary of its Agricultural Resources Report, thedepartment said on February 1, 1987, the average value per acreof farmland stood at 548 dlrs, down eight pct from a yearearlier. Values dropped 12 pct in 1985, it noted.    Real values, which are adjusted for inflation, alsodeclined less than in 1985, because of the low rate ofinflation in 1986.    Real values fell 10 pct compared to 14 pct in 1985, itsaid.    The department said in the Corn Belt and Northern Plains,which suffered severe losses in the past five years, declinesappear to be moderating. Also there are reports of stablevalues in some areas of the Corn Belt, it noted.    The continuing downturn in values reflects the largeacreage of land offered for sale relative to demand, concern about lower crop prices, and uncertainty over farm programs,the department said.    Those factors tend to offset the effects of relatively highcash farm income, lower interest rates, and reduced operatingexpenses, it said. Reuter&#3;
