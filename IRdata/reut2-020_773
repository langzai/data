The company was responding to an FCC proposal of August 4that price caps replace the current rate-of-return regulation,which has been in place for the past 20 years.       ATT said vigorous competition in the long-distance industryhas made obsolete rate-of-return, which stipulates that acompany can earn no more than a fixed rate -- currently 12.2pct -- on its investment.
