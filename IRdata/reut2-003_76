Gencorp said its RKO Generalsubsidiary agreed to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt DisneyCo &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and otheradjustments at closing.    The company said under the agreement in principle, RKO'sapplication to renew the station's broadcast license would bedismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Televisionwould be granted. Disney would then acquire privately heldFidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments.    Renewal of the KHJ-TV license has been challenged inregulatory proceedings for more than 20 years.    The deal is subject to prior approval by the FederalCommunications Commission, the company said.    Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a LosAngeles investor group, and Westinghouse Electric Corp &lt;WX> tosettle the license proceedings and sell KHJ-TV for 313 mlndlrs, 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and theremainder to Fidelity. But on Jan 28, 1987, Westinghousewithdrew from the deal because the FCC would not approve it.    In early 1986, Gencorp and RKO agreed to sell WOR-TV inSecaucus, N.J., to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs. The FCC hasapproved the transaction, but several parties have appealed.    The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals,according to a spokemsan for Akron, Ohio-based Gencorp.    Fidelity Television originally filed a competingapplication for the RKO license for KHJ, an independentstation, in 1965.    In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNAC-TV inBoston, citing anti-competitive trade practices and inaccuratefinancial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previouslygranted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ,to be denied.
