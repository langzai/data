U.S. Secretary of Commerce MalcolmBaldrige said he hopes Japanese Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone will make specific proposals to ease U.S.-Japan tradefriction at a meeting with President Reagan this week.    He also told reporters he hopes the U.S. Will soon be ableto lift sanctions imposed against Japan for alleged violationsof an accord on semiconductors.    "We have been very specific about our trade problems," hetold a news conference during a stopover in Hong Kong. "I hope(Nakasone) brings some specific answers to the trade problems."    "We want to lift the sanctions as soon as possible," Baldrigesaid.    He said that once the U.S. Determines that Japan is sellingsemiconductors at cost it will be able to lift the 300 mln U.S.Dlrs of duties it imposed on Japanese electronics goods onApril 17.    "We have not seen that yet," he said, adding that it wouldtake about one month to determine whether the allegedviolations of a bilateral semiconductor pact had beendiscontinued.    Baldrige did not say what specific solutions he wanted forU.S.-Japan trade problems.    But the New York Times today quoted administration sourcesas saying that the U.S. May be able to lift trade sanctionsagainst Japan by the end of June.    Japan would have to show that it had stopped underpricingsemiconductors and had widened access in Japan top U.S. Chipproducers.    Baldrige also said that despite the current trade rift, theU.S. And Japan have long had friendly ties that neither sidewants to change.    "We have a very special relationship with Japan. Japan is afriend and our ally," Baldrige said. "Neither one of us wantsthat to change."    He also repeated statements that he did not foresee a tradewar with Japan but that the U.S. Had no choice but to imposethe trade sanctions. REUTER&#3;
