Over 750,000 head of cattle are sufferingthe effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of aprolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattleproducing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported.    The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is theisland's number two province in milk production. Granma said20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.    The newspaper said a "cattle emergency" had been decreed andthe cattle are being rounded up.    Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar caneconditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleanedbefore being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed theresidue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head havebeen sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila.    Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beefrationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana,each Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every18 days.    In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically norain has fallen in the past 14 months. Grazing lands areparched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes ofsilage projected in its annual plan.
