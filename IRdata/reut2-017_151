The U.S. M-1 money supply number to beannounced next Thursday is expected to show one of the largestone-week increases in history, analysts said.    The average forecast of economists polled by Reuters callsfor a 17.7 billion dlr M-1 jump for the week ended April 20.Estimates of the increase range from five billion dlrs to 26.3billion dlrs.    "The M-1 surge will be very temporary. About two thirds ofthe increase is likely to be washed out in the following week,"said Kim Rupert, an economist at Money Market Services Inc.    Rupert said a huge increase in M-1 for the April 20 week isimplied by very strong deposit survey data and by anunexpectedly sharp gain in required reserves in Federal Reservedata released Thursday.    Those numbers, covering the two-week bank statement periodthat ended on April 22, show a 2.5 billion dlr jump in basicrequired reserves. Economists said this largely reflected theparking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock marketsales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.Fed seasonal adjustments do not adequately compensate for theseand other special factors.    Analysts noted that income tax refunds from the Treasuryalso appear to be coming earlier than usual.    They also are not adequately compensated for by the Fed'sseasonal adjustment factors to the money supply.    The Federal Reserve is no longer targeting M-1 because thelink between M-1 and economic growth has largely been severedby financial market innovation and deregulation.    As such, there is likely to be little financial marketreaction to the huge M-1 increase that is expected to beannounced next week. Reuter&#3;
