The average tax rate for Canadianfinancial insitutions will increase to 21.3 pct from 14.5 pctunder the new tax reform package, the federal financedepartment said.     The amount of financial institutions' income that is taxedwill also increase to 74.0 pct from 48.7 pct, it said indocuments tabled with finance minister Michael Wilson'sprepared speech to the House of Commons.     Under Wilson's plan, the federal government will collect1.36 billion dlrs more over the next five years from financialinsitutions, including banks, trust mortgage and life insurancecompanies, according to finance department documents.     Financial institutions "are going to complain, but webelieve the changes are appropriate and affordable," said onefinance department official who asked not to be identified.     Ottawa will collect more revenue from financialinstitutions by reducing the amount of reserves they can deductfrom taxes, which "will broaden the tax base for this low taxpaying sector," the finance department said.     Among the changes, chartered banks will no longer be ableto use a five-year averaging formula to calculate loan lossesthat may be deducted for tax purposes.     Effective June 17, 1987, banks will deduct bad or doubtfulloans during the year they are incurred.     The finance department said the impact of the newprovisions will be cushioned over a period of five years.     The changes are needed to ensure that all financialcompanies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financialservices industry.     "It would be inconsistent for the tax system to continueto provide different reserves for tax purposes for institutionscompeting in the same marketplace," the finance departmentsaid. Reuter&#3;
