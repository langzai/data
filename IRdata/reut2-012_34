Finance Ministry sources said a "large majority" of foreignbanks had accepted to extend Brazil's credit lines before themidnight deadline of March 31 for payment of 15 billion dlrsservicing expired.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro told reporters all shortrange credit lines were renewed, "without exception."    Central Bank sources, although incapable of confirming that100 pct of the banks had renewed the credit lines, said thatthere was a massive affirmative reply.    The credit lines were extended in their majority by 30days, but there were banks which renewed the deadline by 90days and, sometimes, by 180 days, Funaro told reporters.
