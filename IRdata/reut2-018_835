With the restart of this 22,700-metric-tonne-per-year line,Reynolds said, it will be operating at 100 pct of itsconsolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes peryear.    Reynolds said work will commence on the potline restart inthe near future and it is expected that actual metal productionwill begin on September one.
