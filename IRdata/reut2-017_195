New York Federal Reserve BankPresident Gerald Corrigan opposed a further fall in the valueof the dollar but refused to say whether U.S. Interest rateswould be raised to protect the currency.    "A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yenat this juncture I would regard as counterproductive," he told anews conference.    His comments echoed those made last week by U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker, who also warned against a further dollarfall. The U.S. Currency plunged to a post-war low below 140 yenlast week, despite dollar-buying by a number of central banks.    Currency speculators and investors are convinced that afurther dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge U.S.Trade deficit, dealers said. The only thing likely to help thedollar is seen as a rise in U.S. Interest rates.    Corrigan refused to say whether the U.S. Was ready to riskdamaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates.    The dollar"s sharp drop this month has also raised questionsabout the usefulness of recent meetings of the Group of Seven.But Corrigan said: "They have played a constructive role in sofar as the broad objective of facilitating a higher degree ofeconomic policy coordination."
