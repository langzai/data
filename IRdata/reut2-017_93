Sugar beet planting in Denmark isabout two weeks behind normal due to a severe winter and a wetspring, a spokesman for the country's largest sugar beetconcern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said.    The weather has improved recently but very little beet hasbeen drilled so far.    "If good weather conditions continue, I think we will besowing next week or the following week," the spokesman said.
