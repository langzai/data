Central bank governor Jose Fernandez saidthe 10.3 billion dlr debt restructuring package he and FinanceSecretary Jaime Ongpin negotiated with the Philippines'commercial creditors was better than Mexico's.    "I think we got a better deal. It was really an enormousdrop, a reduction in rates and that to me is the criticalelement," he told Reuters.    He was reacting to comments by local economists who saidManila's debt accord was no better than Mexico's, which was a20-year repayment, including a seven-year grace last year at13/16 points over London interbank offered rates (Libor).    The Philippines clinched a repayment of 17 years, includinga grace period of 7-1/2 years on 10.3 billion dlrs of its totaldebt of 27.8 billion. Reuter&#3;
