Recent heavy rains have not affected thePeru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a recordharvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperativegroups said.    Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group ofcooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports,told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos)was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101quintales in the year to September 1986.    A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said floodwaters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and thecrop was unaffected.    Floods in early February caused extensive damage in VillaRica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales lastyear, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.    Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop ifthey continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.    He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase thisyear in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales,assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.    He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO memberslast year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICOmembers. Reuter&#3;
