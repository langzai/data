Japan's ailing shipyards have wonapproval from the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel toslash production to about half of total capacity for one year,effective April 1, industry sources said.    The approval follows an act of parliament passed last weekdesigned to help the industry regroup and shed 20 pct ofcapacity by March 31, 1988, Transport Ministry officials said.    The cartel, comprising 33 yards capable of constructingships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes, will limit newbuildingoutput to a maximum of three mln compensated gross registeredtonnes in 1987/88, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said.    Industry sources said the 33 will seek to renew the cartelin 1988/89 in the belief demand will remain sluggish.    Last week's temporary act of parliament also allowsshipbuilders to receive favourable taxation terms plus up to 50billion yen in compensation for liabilities incurred throughjob losses and the sale of excess capacity.    Up to 30 billion yen has been allocated for purchasingredundant land and equipment from shipbuilders.    The Ministry will start drawing up its restructuringguidelines from April 1 and the yards will implement theguidelines from September, industry sources said. REUTER&#3;
