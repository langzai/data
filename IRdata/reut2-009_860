Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> rebutted U.S.Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and TelegraphCorp's &lt;T.N>, AT and T, entry into French telecommunicationsfirm &lt;Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques>, CGCT.    Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that theacquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T andPhilips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decidedon two years ago as claimed by AT and T.    The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemensat the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.The result of the negotiations was still open.    Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.    The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairmanJames E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and Tand Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in theU.S.    Baur said he expected the French government to decide onthe winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the Frenchswitchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.    The French government has limited CGCT participation byforeign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francsfor the whole company.    Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to theinitial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later butsaid Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.    Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm&lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start ofMarch because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies willform a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.   Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company whileJeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mlnfrancs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centrewith was also being planned. REUTER&#3;
