Firmer crude oil prices, government aidpackages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oilindustry recover from last year sharp downturn, industryanalysts said.    They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices droppedabout 50 pct.    On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared totheir highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading atrecord highs.    "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on thepart of the investment community that the outlook for theindustry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and CoLtd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.    Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of lastyear's results, analysts said.    "But the financial statements are a snap shot and arecording of history. The stock market is the indication of thefuture," Gobert commented.    The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15at the end of 1986.    Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares ofImperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, istrading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.    Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, isat 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.    Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecastsoperating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gascompanies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrsand operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billiondlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs abarrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increasewith cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said.    "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of theprofit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,"he added.    Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, whenoperating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90billion dlrs.    But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will holdrecent gains and more government assistance is needed.    Canadian Petroleum Association technical director HansMaciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crudeoil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPECproduction accord will continue to support prices.    However, several companies share the optimistic industryoutlook expressed by a majority of analysts.    Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecastimproved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued thisweek, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.    "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but notrobust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report.    "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there isgood reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added.    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies havepared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,deferring most frontier exploration work.    "The industry is becoming very selective in investments,very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,"Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushionthe industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.    The most significant help came last September when thefederal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oilcompanies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flowdecline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented furtherexploration spending cuts, analysts said.    "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutelynecessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments thatwere made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerablymore," Maciej said.
