Three UnitedSteelworkers of America locals on strike at Cominco Ltdrejected a tentative three-year contract, a unionrepresentative said.     "The vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or45.5 pct, for the contract. Eighty-one pct of the membershipvoted," he said.     The union representative said that the pact offered costof living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, butcontained no wage increase.           The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet andprepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, hesaid.     The three locals cover about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,B.C. lead-zinc mine.     Output at both sites has been shut down since theproduction and maintenance workers, along with about 600 officeand technical workers, went on strike May nine.          The two Steelworkers locals representing the office andtechnical workers have not negotiated since May 21.     The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeire, whichmeans the company may not be able to honor contracts forproducts from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.            The union had requested a three pct wage increase in eachyear of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for athree-year contract and some loosening of the rules on jobclassifications.     The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.     The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.     Revenues from the Trail smelter totalled 356 mln Canadiandlrs in 1986.         Reuter&#3;
