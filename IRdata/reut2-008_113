The government'sover-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affectingAustralia's economic performance, Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.    Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income isderived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weakcrude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.    This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts thecountry's economic performance directly by acting as adisincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affectingtrading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.    Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiencyposition is posing a major economic threat, yet thegovernment's response has been to load new tax burdens on theoil industry, Benbow said.    Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected tofall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of theBass Strait fields, he said.    Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with thethree largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.    By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just overhalf the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undevelopedfields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery fromexisting fields goes ahead, Benbow said.    Government projections of output from as yet undiscoveredfields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.    Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying acrude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five yearstime, he said.    At present world oil prices and the current value of theAustralian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would costbetween 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.    Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, theaddition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.    For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the fiveyears 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.    He called on the government to review its tax policies torestore incentive to exploration. REUTER&#3;
