Unidentified jets attacked three Iranianoil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at leastone of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.    Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks hadreported that American forces launched a retaliatory strikeagainst Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oildrilling platforms and setting them ablaze.    The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhshoffshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by awave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up fromthe Rostam field soon after.    At least one of the other two targets was also believed tobe ablaze, the sources said.    The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqiair strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported anysouthern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.    Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iranused its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter andlater speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.    U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Fridaywhen an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged aU.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he hadalready made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iranattack but would not say what the decision was. REUTER&#3;
