Arvin Industries Inc said higherinterest costs from borrowings to make acquisitions willproduce earnings flat with last year's 59 cts a share results.    Arvin said it might earn 57 cts to 60 cts a share in thequarter.    These results also reflect the seasonally low sales patternof automotive replacement parts in that period.    Arvin forecast about 85 cts a share net in the secondquarter compared with 68 cts in last year's period.    The company said revenues for full year 1987 it will exceed1.4 billion dlrs, net earnings will increase more than 30 pct,while per share earnings should increase 12 to 18 pct.    Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mlnand earnings per share 2.46 dlrs.    It based these forecasts due to the addition of SchraderAutomotive Inc and Maremont Corp, both acquired last year.    Chairman James Baker said 1987 quarterly comparisons willnot conform to historical patterns for the year because theacquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in differentquarters.    He said Arvin will complete the purchase of SystemsResearch Laboratories in the second quarter of 1987. This willalso increase revenues. Reuter&#3;
