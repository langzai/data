Treasury Assistant Secretary DavidMulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement amongsix industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchangerate stability around current levels.    In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate bankingsubcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paristhat "further substantial exchange rate shifts could damagegrowth and adjustment prospects."    But he also said while there are clear understandings amongthe countries regarding cooperation, "We have refrained fromestablishing a system of target zones or ranges."    Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out theway in which they intend to deal with possible marketdevelopments.    He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing withexchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigidexchange rate objectives "or to specify too precisely the goalsof intervention" would hurt official attempts to react tomarket pressures, he said.    Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currencyobjectives and intervention to achieve those objectives wouldbe counterproductive.    Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated theTreasury position that the current account deficit will declinefrom 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs thisyear, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18months.    But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected bycommitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate theireconomies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit andenhance U.S. competitiveness.    He also said some newly industrialized countries should lettheir currencies appreciate. Reuter&#3;
