U.K. Producer price data for March wereroughly as expected after taking into account technical factorswhich affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analystssaid.    The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonallyadjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged fromFebruary and close to the average for the last six months.    The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pctin February.    But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips andDrew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected arise in excise duties which affected the index in March lastyear.    He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much intothe monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in Aprilwould take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.    Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' inputprices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factorssuch as a fall in industrial electricity costs.    Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures wereslightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterlinghad not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.    Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep inputcosts down over the next few months, although Tinker added thatlast year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of theyear-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return torises in the index rather than falls.
