Roughly half of this year's expected130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in theNetherlands, told Reuters.    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing datefor the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesmanadded.    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we canexpect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least thecrop is off to a very good start," he said.    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes ofwhite sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has beenintroduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have beenallotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area beingboosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar. Reuter&#3;
