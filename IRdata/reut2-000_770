U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter today said that if the European Community's Council ofMinisters approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, anothermajor transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.    In a statement issued by the trade representative's officefollowing a speech to the American Soybean Association's boardof directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severeimpact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billiondlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.    "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its(vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but tovigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access tothe European market," Yeutter said.    Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violateEC obligations under the GATT.    He said the effect of the tax would be to double the priceof soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarinemade from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,and closer in price to expensive European butter.    "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose sucha provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolvedthe agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC toinclude Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.    "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontationalcourse before the recent wounds have healed and as we arebeginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of globaltrade talks)," he said.
