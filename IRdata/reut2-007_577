Strong south-easterly winds werekeeping many vessels trapped in the ice off the Finnish andSwedish coasts in one of the worst icy periods in the Balticfor many years, the Finnish Board of Navigation said.    In Finland and Sweden up to 50 vessels were reported to bestuck in the ice, and even the largest of the assistingicebreakers were having difficulties in breaking through to thestranded ships, coastguard officials said.    However, icy conditions in the southern Baltic at theSoviet oil ports of Ventspils and Klaipeda had eased, they said.    Weather officials in neighbouring Sweden said the icyconditions in the Baltic were the worst for 30 years, withships fighting a losing battle to keep moving.    In the coastal stretches of the Gulf of Bothnia, whichdivides Finland and Sweden, the ice is up to one metre thick,with drifts and currents packing it into almost impenetrablewalls three metres high, Swedish coastguard officials said.    Weather forecasts say winds may ease during the weekend buta further drop in temperature could bring shipping to astandstill, the officials said. Reuter&#3;
