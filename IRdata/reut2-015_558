National Computer Systems Incexpects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, thecompany told analysts, although it said the April 30 firstquarter should show "down earnings and virtually flatrevenues."    Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has takensteps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected toincrease modestly because of the company's decision to downsizeits leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from aone-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of thediscontinuance of products last year.    Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results willbe down as a result of a major financial systems sales lastyear, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number ofshares outstanding.    The company said the next three consecutive quarters shoulddemonstrate "excellent earnings growth." Reuter&#3;
