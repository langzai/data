President Reagan made public adetailed set of orders to his national security staff designedto prevent scandals similar to the Iran arms affair.    In a message to Congress accompanying National SecurityDecision Directive (NSDD) 266, Reagan said: "(The reforms) areevidence of my determination to return to proper procedures,including consultation with the Congress."    NSDDs are normally classified. Officials said this was thefirst time the duties of the national security staff had beenspelled out in such a document since the National SecurityCouncil (NSC) was set up by Congress 40 years ago.    The orders implement the recommendations of the TowerCommission, named by the president to investigate the secretU.S. Arms sales to Iran and led by former Senator John Tower.    In a scathing report on February 26, the panel blasted theconduct of the NSC staff and criticised the president for beingunaware of many of the activities of his subordinates.    Reagan accepted the report's conclusions in a speech onMarch 4 and said he had barred NSC staff from conducting covertoperations. The prohibition is laid out in NSDD 266 which callsfor a "small, highly competent (NSC staff) broadly experiencedin the making of national security policy."    NSDD 266 said the organization should impose "clear verticallines of control and accountability."    The eight page document said the NSC's use of privateindividuals and organisations as intermediaries to conductcovert activities would be "appropriately limited and subject toclose observation."    It said the NSC staff should include a legal adviser whowould have access to all information. The national securityadviser should initiate periodic reassessments of policies andoperations and ensure that consultations and presidentialdecisions are adequately recorded, it said. REUTER&#3;
