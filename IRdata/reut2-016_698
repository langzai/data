No formal talks have been scheduled yetamong companies involved in a controversial proposal to mergetwo groups seeking to enter Japan's internationaltelecommunications sector, an official from one group said.    "Nothing has been firmed up yet," said an official at&lt;International Digital Communications Planning Inc> (IDC), oneof the groups set up last year to study competing against&lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which monopolises the sector.    Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, which holds a 20pct share in IDC, has opposed plans to merge with rival group,&lt;International Telecom Japan Inc>.    Under the plan, backed by the Post and TelecommunicationsMinistry, Cable and Wireless and U.S.-based &lt;Pacific TelesisInternational Inc> would become core companies in the mergedfirm, with shares equal to those of the six major Japanese corecompanies and seats on the board of directors.    Britain, angry over what it feels are moves to restrictCable and Wireless' role in the sector, views the issue as atest case. The IDC official declined to specify what washolding up the talks.    A spokesman for C. Itoh and Co Ltd &lt;CITT.T>, which holds 20pct of IDC, said a meeting may be held later this week. REUTER&#3;
