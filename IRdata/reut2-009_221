A leading member of Britain's oppositionLabour Party said there was strong evidence Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher approved the sale of anti- aircraft missilesto Nicaraguan Contra rebels during talks last year with U.S.Officials involved in the Iran arms scandal.    Labour foreign affairs spokesman George Foulkes toldparliament the U.S. Tower Commission report on the sale of armsto Iran showed Colonel Oliver North had tried to obtain 20Blowpipe missiles and 10 launchers through a South Americancountry from a Belfast-based company, Short Brothers, whichmanufactures the missiles.    Short Brothers is owned by the British Government.    Junior Foreign Officer Minister Timothy Eggar dismissed theclaims as "wild and fanciful allegations" with no foundation.    Foulkes said North testified he was seeking the help of "ahead of an allied government" in obtaining the Blowpipes andsuggested the supply of missiles was discussed during twomeetings which he said took place between North, the then headof the CIA William Casey and Thatcher in 1986.    "We need to know what happened at those meetings between MrCasey, Colonel North and the Prime Minister last year. Whatwere they talking about if it were not the supply of Blowpipemissiles to the Contra terrorists?" Foulkes said. Reuter&#3;
