Centel Corp said it sees 1987 firstquarter results below those of 1986 due to regulatory limits ontelephone earnings and 15 cts to 20 cts a share dilution from1986 acquisitions.    In the annual report, Chairman Robert Reuss toldshareholders telephone profits will continued to be limited byceilings imposed by regulators as well as deregulation andstructural changes within the industry that have slowed growthin the investment base for setting rates.    As such, its first quarter 1987 results will be below lastyear's first quarter of 1.11 dlrs a share, he said.    "Several of the company's telephone units may be faced witha reduction in the rates of return authorized by theirregulators," Reuss said. "This could result in some ratereductions and refunds to customers."    Reuss said he is encouraged by the prospects for progressin Centel's business communications, cable television andcellular telephone units.    Centel is asking shareholders at the annual meeting toapprove the tripling  to 120 mln in authorized shares. Reuter&#3;
