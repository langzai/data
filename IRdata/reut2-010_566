Iran has produced a short-rangesurface-to-surface missile with technological help from Chinaand is working with Peking on a longer-range missile capable ofhitting most areas of Iraq, the Observer newspaper said.    The British Sunday paper, quoting Iranian sources, said theshorter-range missile was based on a Chinese version of theSoviet-made Frog and had been fired at the Iraqi port of Basra.The missile has a range of 40 miles.    The other type, similar to the Soviet army"s Scud B with arange of 180 miles, is at an advanced stage of development,according to the Observer.    The development of a longer-range weapon would enable Iranto strike at many towns and cities on the territory of itsrelatively small neighbour.    Earlier this month, Iran acknowledged it had acquiredChinese-made Silkworm missiles capable of hitting tankerscarrying crude oil from Arab countries to the West.    Iran said it would use its Silkworm anti-ship missileagainst shipping in the waterway only if Iraqi air and missileraids prevented it from exporting oil.    The Silkworms are large mobile missiles with a range of 60miles, which can carry a warhead of 1,000 pounds. REUTER&#3;
