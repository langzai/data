Members of the Chicago MercantileExchange (CME) rejected a membership petition to ban dualtrading in Standard and Poor's 500 stock index futures andoptions on futures, the exchange said.    Members voted 1,272 to 525 against a proposal to prohibitmembers from filling customer orders and trading for their ownaccount, known as dual trading, in the S and P contracts.    Instead of an outright ban on dual trading, the CME boardadopted new rules, which include limitations on dual trading instock index products, that will now be sent to the CommodityFutures Trading Commission for approval.    The new rules will limit the use of the top step in the Sand P 500 futures and options pits, where the most activecontract is traded, to brokers filling customer orders only.They may not transact business for their own account.    The CME last week hired a new compliance officer andincreased the staff of the market surveillance department toenhance security and regulation of the exchange.    The rule changes also require brokers in S and P futuresand options to manually record to the nearest minute the timeof all personal trades in stock index products.    Finally, the board voted to impose strict limits on tradingwithin broker groups applicable to the entire exchange andredefined broker groups to more completely cover all forms ofassociations. A percentage limitation on the personal tradingof a broker group member with other members of the group, and apercentage limitation on filling orders between members of thesame broker group, will be set.    John Sandner, CME board chairman, said in a statement theoriginal petition would have adversely affected liquidity,discriminated against every broker and deprived all customersof their right to choose a broker who is a dual trader.
