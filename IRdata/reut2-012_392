Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HK> saidit might look for overseas investments and that could lead itto consider re-registering in Bermuda.    Asked if Hong Kong Land had any plans for investmentoverseas a spokesman said "Not at the moment. It's a long-termconcept."    The London newspaper Daily Telegraph yesterday quoted SimonKeswick, chairman of Hong Kong Land's parent company, JardineMatheson Holdings Ltd &lt;JARD.HK>, as saying the company was at acrossroads because the last of its non-property assets willsoon be spun off.    Hongkong Land's residential properties have also been sold,leaving the firm largely with commercial property in the mainbusiness district of the British colony.    "If we can't find any opportunities we might have to lookabroad," Keswick was quoted by the newspaper as saying.    A re-registration in Bermuda would be largely to shelteroverseas income from Hong Kong taxes, analysts said.    Jardine Matheson reincorporated in Bermuda in 1984 in amove that raised fears over the colony's political future andstunned the local stock market.    That response was not repeated when &lt;Dairy FarmInternational Holdings Ltd> then a Hongkong Land subsidiary,and &lt;Mandarin Oriental International Ltd>, soon to be spun offfrom Land, announced plans for similar re-registrations.    Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd &lt;JSH.HK>, another Jardinesubsdidiary, is also registered in Bermuda. REUTER&#3;
