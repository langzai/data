(Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce)is considering classifying its 1.2 Canadian billion dlrs inloans to Brazil as non-accrual and will decide whether it willdo so in June, bank chairman R. Donald Fullerton told reportersafter a business speech here.    Fullerton said the loans would be listed as non-accrual infinancial results for the second quarter ending April 30.    (Bank of Montreal), which has loaned about two billionCanadian dlrs to Brazil, the largest amount of any Canadianbank, previously said it is also considering declaring theloans as non-accrual in second quarter results.    Under Canadian guidlines, loans are classified asnon-accrual when there are indications the bank will loseinterest or principal on the loan or when it believes it willbe difficult to fully settle the account within a reasonableperiod.    Several U.S. banks have already announced they plan toplace their loans to Brazil on non-accrual lists.    Fullerton also said Canadian Imperial still plans to enterthe brokerage business this year after the federal governmentintroduces laws that will let banks expand their actitivities.    "We'll be looking at anything in the Canadian market atthis point in time--from the very biggest (brokerage company)to the very smallest," Fullerton told reporters.    Fullerton said he considers buying seats on stock exchanges"a sensible move".    Fullerton declined to comment on TransCanada Pipelines Ltd(TRP)'s bid for Dome Petroleum Ltd (DMP). Canadian Imperial hasabout 900 mln Canadian dlrs in outstanding loans to Dome,making it one of the oil company's two largest Canadiancreditors. The bank has a joint director on Dome's managementboard, Fullerton said.              Fullerton said he did not have enough information on thebid to evaluate its effect on Dome or its debt restructuringtalks.    Fullerton called in a prepared speech for full reciprocityin any free-trade agreement with the U.S. involving financialservices.    "There are strong indications that financial services arebeing bargained away in the current free trade negotiationsbetween Canada and the United States with no requirement offull reciprocity," Fullerton said.              He said U.S. banks given equal privileges with Canadianbanks here would be able to operate throughout the countrywhile Canadian banks in the U.S. would be subject to approvaland regulation by each state.
