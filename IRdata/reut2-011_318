Gruppo Ferruzzi is studying aproject which could result in a public share offer of up to 49pct of its French unit European Sugar (France) and could raisearound 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.    Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration wasaimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mlndlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right."    European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit EridaniaZuccherifici Nazionali SpA, is expected to absorb the Europeancorn wet milling business of CPC International Inc whichFerruzzi recently agreed to buy.    Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle tobuy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.    A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group wasstudying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugaralong with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, butgave no details.    The flotation plan has been interpreted by financialanalysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of theCPC business. Reuter&#3;
