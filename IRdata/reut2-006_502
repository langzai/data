Continental Illinois Corp said if theBrazilian debt moratorium remains in effect, it may place itsmedium and long term loans to Brazil on a cash basis.    This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mlndlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the fullyear, company officials told a press briefing.    Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs,according to the annual report released at the briefing.    In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing adeclining level of foreign currency reserves, declared amoratorium on the payment of interest on the country's mediumand long term debt obligations.    Continental said it may take similar action on its loans toEcuador, which total 25 mln dlrs. This would reduce 1987pre-tax and after-tax net by 800,000 dlrs in the first quarter,and by two mln dlrs for the full year, the bank-holdingcompany's officers said. Reuter&#3;
