Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and wouldnot accept a "mad" increase that would drive consumers away.    He told al-Riyadh newspaper, "Saudi Arabia follows abalanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease inprices from current levels and it also does not accept a madincrease that would drive consumers away and make them try andfind alternative sources (for energy)."    OPEC agreed last December to cut production after worldprices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing systemaimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.    OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where itwill review its current oil price and production policy.    Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oilprices to remain stable for the next two years.    Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing andproduction pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. Thecurrent pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrsa barrel average. REUTER&#3;
