Alabama has advanced from a Class Bto a Class A rating in the eradication of cattle brucellosisprogram, thus relieving some restrictions in the interstatemovement of cattle from the state, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment said.    To qualify for a Class A rating, a state must keep its herdinfection rate at or below 0.25 pct for 12 months.
