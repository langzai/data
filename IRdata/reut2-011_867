U.S. Senate Agriculture Committeechairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said it would be impossible tocut two billion dlrs from the fiscal 1988 agriculture budget asproposed by Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles(D-Fla.)    "I don't know how we could possibly absorb two billion dlrsof cuts without enormous disruptions," Leahy told the NationalCattlemen's Association.    Chiles has proposed making unspecified policy changes thatwould trim two billion dlrs from farm income and price supportprograms in the fiscal year beginning next October.    Leahy said such cuts would be impossible, that one billiondlrs in cuts would be "darn near impossible" and that a spendingfreeze would be difficult.    Leahy said Congress would have to provide "some money" forthe Farm Credit System, but that a "wholesale bailout" would notbe forthcoming.    "We may need changes in (the system's) procedures but wewill not let the system go belly up or simply become anotherbank," he said.    A task force composed of Leahy and Sens. David Boren(D-Okla.), Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.)is working on a proposal for assisting the Farm Credit Systemthat Leahy said should be ready shortly after Congress's Easterrecess, set for April 13 through 20.    Leahy said his panel would consider changes in the wheatand feedgrains programs this year, including a proposal toestablish mandatory production controls.    However, he said a bill offered by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) would probably not passCongress as presently written.    A bill to provide emergency disaster assistance tomidwestern grain producers, already passed by the House, maynot be considered by the Senate for another 10 days becausemembers have lined up as many as two dozen amendments costingbillions of dollars, he said.
