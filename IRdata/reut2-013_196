Mario Gabelli, head of New Yorkinvestment firm Mario Gabelli and Co, said he sold some sharesof GenCorp Inc &lt;GY> as part of a "portfolio rebalancing"process to meet the needs of his more than 600 clients.    He said as the stock moved up following acquisitionproposals from a group formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> andWagner and Brown, some of his clients were overweighted.    Regarding the company's shareholders meeting Tuesday,Gabelli told Reuters, "there was nothing said that caused me tosell or buy." He still thinks "values are 140 dlrs per share ormore" and has clients that asked to buy more.

"We wanted to remove our clients from the processunfolding between GenCorp and Wagner and Brown," he said.    He said he was pleased that chairman A. William Reynoldsstated at the meeting that he found the concept of greenmail tobe "repugnant." Greenmail refers to a corporation buying out ashareholder at a premium not available to others.
