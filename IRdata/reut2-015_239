Angered by late flights andcomplicated restrictions on discount air fares, a senator hasintroduced legislation to make airlines provide more details onfares and schedules in their advertisements.    Sen. Frank Lautenberg, the bill's sponsor, said airline adsnow are often misleading because they do not give prospectivepassengers enough facts about discount fares.    "Air travelers are lured by low advertised fares whichsimply aren't available," the New Jersey Democrat said in astatement. "It's the old bait and switch."    Airline advertisements usually say discount seats arelimited, but Lautenberg said more information was needed. Reuter&#3;
