The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to useforeign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annualexport earnings for export promotion abroad.    The move is designed by the government to improve India'strade deficit.    Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange PermitScheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, varioustextiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering andelectronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sportsgoods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.    The scheme replaces current rules which allow differentamounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain aminimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.    RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products willqualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotionalspending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board valueof annual export earnings.    These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw andsemi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.    RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of thetwo groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of theirfreight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
