Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy withthe intermittent buying activities of the International CocoaOrganization's buffer stock manager, industry sources toldReuters.    "The way he is operating at the moment is doing almostnothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to beactively depressing it," one company spokesman said.    Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the totalamount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since herecently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.    Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below whichthe bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.    "Even before he started operations, traders estimated themanager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnesmaximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said.    "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buyup to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simplystep back," he added.    "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of themarket at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and themarket because everyone is holding back from both buying andselling waiting to see what the manager will do next," oneprocessor said.    "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market islikely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he isabout to alter his methods," he added.    Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer pricesfor cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stockbuying for some time to come. Reuter&#3;
