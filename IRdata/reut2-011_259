Pigmeat and beef futures, which havebeen thinly traded on the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,despite lower physical prices and the introduction of newcontracts, need more effective marketing, LMFE chairman PatElmer said in his annual report.    In 1986 the Exchange introduced live cattle and pig cashsettlement contracts, representing a move away from theproblems of cash distortions and squeezes, which initialdeliverable "buyers option" contracts created, he said.    Although the physical industry is aware of the market andfollows its prices keenly, this has not been reflected inmarket volume, Elmer said.    "If we are to achieve our true potential the floor membersmust give the market much more time and attention," he added. Reuter&#3;
