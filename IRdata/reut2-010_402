NATO ambassadors met in emergencysession today to discuss tension between members Greece andTurkey over a disputed area of the Aegean Sea on the WesternAlliance's southern flank, Greek diplomatic sources said.    They said no information had yet emerged from the meeting,called after statements from both countries that they wereprepared to back rival oil exploration teams with warships.    General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the TurkishGeneral Staff, said today the Turkish research ship Sismik 1,escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail intodisputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.    Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said "The militaryreadiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lessonif our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions."    The row erupted when the Greek government said last monththat it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium whichwas already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos andwould drill in the same area after the takeover.
