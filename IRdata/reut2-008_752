&lt;Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit onexploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil priceslast year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.    But he told a press conference that due to the highmarginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact ofthe drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.    The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, withPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, hesaid.    As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration andproduction sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.    Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/ShellGroup &lt;RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against8.81 mln.    Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oiloutput from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for thecompany. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in thecurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the declinein output from the major Brent field, he said.    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gasliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected tobe maintained in 1987, he said.    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and OspreyNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oilprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider NorthSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought thecost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.    Day to day operating costs of the exploration andproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the targetis to keep costs per barrel constant.    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading tothe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early togauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to aprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit &lt;ShellU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987were a "bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986."    In November and December in particular, refining operationshad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oilproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continuegenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip tobecome negative from time to time, depending on pricemovements.    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery willnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about fivemonths behind schedule, following a crane accident whichseverely damaged the plant last year, he said.    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemicalsite.    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by whichcompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPRT, was "helpful," but rather less than had been hoped for.    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was inthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, hewould expect some over-production above OPEC"s official 15.8 mlnbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrainoutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil willfall. Reuter&#3;
