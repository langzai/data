The Commodity Exchange Inc,COMEX, is researching the possibility of offering futurescontracts on foreign currency swaps and Ginnie Mae repurchaseagreements, a COMEX consultant said.    Kurt Dew, president of Risk Analysis Systems, said the ideawas on the drawing board at the staff level and not nearrealization.    Dew said the contracts would be logical successors to twocontracts already proposed by the exchange -- futures oninterest rate swaps and on Treasury repurchase agreements, orrepos.    Regulations recently proposed by federal bank regulatorscould enhance the attractiveness of futures contracts oncurrency swaps, he said.    Those regulations would require banks to allocate a certainshare of its capital to currency swaps, Dew said. Futures oncurrency swaps would not require capital allocation.    A futures market in Government National MortgageAssociation (Ginnie Mae) repos would help investors outside thecircle of primary dealers get the best possible price, Dewsaid.    Dew emphasized that the COMEX board had not yet consideredthe contracts. Reuter&#3;
