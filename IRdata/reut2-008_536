Britain has reaped profits by using astronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government lastautumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellorof the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.    He said in a parliamentary debate, "I can now tell the House(of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reservesin September and October (1986) have subsequently all beenrepurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds."    Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressuresthen for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said.The increase in base rates was instead limited then to onepoint.    During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawsonunveiled last week, he said that "during the period of foreignexchange market turbulence which followed the somewhatinconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at theend of September, I authorised the Bank of England to interveneunusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that wouldenable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct ratherthan the two pct the market was then pressing for."    He said that that one percentage point increase, effectedin October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two halfpoint cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10pct.    Treasury figures show that the underlying change in Britishreserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of Englandintervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that theauthorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September andOctober 1986, government sources said.
