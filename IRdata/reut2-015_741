Zimbabwe's beef exports to the EuropeanCommunity (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs thisyear, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouthdisease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to theEC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the ECveterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province hasalready led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia tobar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairyindustry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in exportrevenue.    "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normallywhen an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension ofbeef exports," one industry source said yesterday.     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on theseriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee thendecides on three options, allowing us to continue exportingbeef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspensionon exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We arestill awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to beidentified.    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes ofhigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country hadspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences andupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will beforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at lowprices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef salescould fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said. Reuter&#3;
