A confidential World Bank report on thePeruvian economy has said the government's strategy does notoffer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and islikely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure.    The report, published today by the economic monthly, ThePeru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia'sgovernment in stimulating output last year to achieve a growthin gross domestic product of over eight pct "represents gains inthe short term at the expense of the long."    Government officials had no immediate comment on thereport, which advised a reduction in the overall size of thepublic investment program and greater emphasis on thepreservation of Peru's export potential.    The report said that although the government had succeededin cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivationprogram was encountering rising difficulties.    "An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked tomonetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing ofprice controls, appears not improbable," it added.    The world bank report said the government's policies hadreduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption atthe apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of thecurrency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses,and sharply diminished creditworthiness.    It said unless the government took action quickly to fix acompetitive exchange rate and control the public sectordeficit, "the higher the probability will be that the governmentwill eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment ofdomestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still furthercontrols on imports in order to stem inflation and support thebalance of payments."    It said the bank would place more emphasis on thepreservation of peru's export potential, external links andoverall economic efficiency.    The government's incentive policies towards the mining andpetroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports,suggested that it did not accord high priority to theireconomic viability, it added.
