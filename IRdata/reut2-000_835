Fisons Plc &lt;FISN.L> said stronginternational growth had been the main feature of the group's1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, alarger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form ofits Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.    The company was commenting on 1986 results which sawpre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.The result was in line with market forecasts, but its sharesnevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from643p.    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, aswell as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearlyindicated by a strong 1986 performance.    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportionof high technology products it manufactures and also raised itsability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operationshad demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cashflow from all three operations had been positive despite a fullprogramme of capital investment.    Action to protect the group against foreign currencymovements resulted in a small net gain to profits. REUTER&#3;
