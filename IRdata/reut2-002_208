Turkey is holding a buying tender for100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said.    The sugar is being sought for early arrival and willprobably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added.    Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisementfrom Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnesof crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decreasethe amount.    Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exportedbetween 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran andbetween 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq.    Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analystssaid Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continuefilling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.    Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mlnin 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous threeseasons.    The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted TurkishMinister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkeywould export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import thesame amount. REUTER&#3;
