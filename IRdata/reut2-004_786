Talks between France and Iran on therepayment of a one billion dlr loan by the late Shah have madeprogress, Roland Dumas, head of a parliamentary Foreign AffairsCommittee said.    "They are progressing as far as I have heard," Dumas toldreporters. "The two delegations appear to be near an agreementon the figures."    Dumas, a close aide to President Francois Mitterrand,earlier this week met Iranian Charge d'Affaires in ParisHaddadi Gholam-reza.    The report of progress contrasts with official Frenchstatements last month after talks between Deputy IranianFinance Minister Mehdi Navvab and the French Finance Ministry.    The talks, the latest round in long-running negotiationsbetween the two countries, were said to have led to littleprogress on the loan repayment issue.    France made a first repayment of 330 mln dlrs lastNovember. Since then negotiatiors have shuttled between Tehranand Paris for talks which France hopes will help secure freedomfor hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.    Iran is claiming full repayment of principal and intereston the Shah's loan, made in 1975 to the EURODIF uraniumenrichment consortium. It has also asked France to curb theactivities of Iranian dissidents in France and stop sellingweapons to Iraq, its enemy in the Gulf War.    France for its part has made a counter claim for more than500 mln dlrs in compensation for contracts with French firmsbroken after the 1979 revolution. REUTER&#3;
