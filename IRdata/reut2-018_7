Pakistan says its economy has continuedits recent outstanding performance during the financial year1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,investments and energy were causing concern.    GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, accordingto a government economic survey.     The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentumand there was an impressive performance in a five pointgovernment program for rural uplift, education and povertyalleviation, said the survey.    Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a newsconference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstormsdamaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pctcompared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might nowslide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.    The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be ninepct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.    Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, homeremittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrsfrom the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.    More exports and an improvement in the balance of paymentssituation will be required to overcome this declining trend inhome remittances, he said.    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because ofthe boost in exports.    He said national investment continued to be small becauseof a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said moresavings were required to maintain or possibly step up thepresent growth rate and to finance the country's seventhfive-year development plan to be launched in July 1988. REUTER&#3;
