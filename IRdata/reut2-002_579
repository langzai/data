Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken> banking groupsaid it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loancollateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST> founder and former chiefexecutive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.    The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.    The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse'sunofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid forthe shares although it expected to buy them back itself.    The statement said the sale did not represent anywithdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermentagroup and that it had been sanctioned by the other mainshareholders.    Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loansof 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks whichlast month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solveits immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other mainshareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mlncrowns until a new equity issue could be made.    Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.    Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crownloan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.    Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mlncrowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor andshareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner&lt;Industrivarden AB>.    The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has beendoubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level thisweek after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said thecompany was in a much worse state than he thought.
