Philadelphia Electric Co will haveto spend an average of about five mln dlrs a day to replace theelectricity which would have been generated by the Peach Bottomnuclear power plant, Chairman J. Lee Everett said.    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered the utility toclose the plant early last week.    "This is the first time an operating plant has been shutdown by the NRC specifically because of plant operatorproblems," Everett told the company's annual meeting.    He did not say who would pay for the replacement power --rate payers or shareholders.    Everett told the meeting Philadelphia Electric can not givea definitive answer on the cost of the shutdown until it getsPeach Bottom back in service.    He said the utility had been aware for some time it hadattitude problems among the operating forces at Peach Bottomand thought it had been making progress toward improvement.    "While the attitude of operating personnel at Peach Bottomhas been rated poor, the attitudes or our personnel atLimerick, our other nuclear plant, have been rated excellent.We have asked ourselves over and over how two plants, managedby the same company, can be so different."    Everett said "Limerick has been the model for improvementswe set out to accomplish at Peach Bottom, and remains so."    He said a special committee composed of PhiladelphiaElectric's outside directors will monitor and direct thecompany's investigation of the problem. Reuter&#3;
