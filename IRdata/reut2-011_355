"Government by veto is not leadership," the West VirginiaDemocrat told reporters. "It's confrontation."    He said Reagan "is attempting to show he's back andrehabilitated by vetoing a very important bill."    The House is expected to override the veto today, but theoutcome is uncertain in the Senate.
