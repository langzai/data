The Writers Guild of America said itsmembers have struck the news staffs of CBS Inc &lt;CBS> andCapital Cities/ABC Inc &lt;CCB> this morning after negotiationsfor a new contract broke down.    The guild said there had been extensions prior to thestrike deadline this morning, but said the strike was calledafter the companies refused to negotiate.    The guild said the companies failed to put a final offer onthe table, made no money offer at all, and did not deviatesubstantially from their original proposals, which, the guildsaid, would have gutted the union contract.    The guild said the networks demanded the right to terminateemployees at will and lay them off without the  arbitration,and the hiring of temporary employees to replace stafferemployees.    The guild represents newswriters, editors, desk assistants,researchers, production assistants, promotion writers andgraphic artists.    The strike affects unions in New York, Chicago, Washingtonand Los Angeles. Picketing will commence at corporateheadquarters in New York and other locations, the guild said. Reuter&#3;
