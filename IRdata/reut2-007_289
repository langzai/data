European Community (EC) industryministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures,drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer, and calculated tolead to the loss of about 22,000 jobs.    The ministers resolved that the proposed closures, whichshould bring production capacity more in line with weak demand,"remain considerably below the surplus in capacity."    They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult withEurofer, major steel companies and with governments, topinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond theannual 15.26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer.    The Commission will draw up a new system  of steelproduction quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the fullrigors of open competition.    Commission sources said any new system would cover onlyheavy products representing about 45 pct of the market, insteadof 65 pct under the present system.    Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meetagain in Brussels on June 1, the sources said.    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministerscapacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and thatthis excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990. Reuter&#3;
