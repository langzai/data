Prospects of an agreement onrescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of Philippine foreign debthave increased following the offer of a higher interest rate byManila officials, foreign banking sources said.    The sources said Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin made theproposal to a 12-bank advisory committee, chaired byManufacturers Hanover Trust Co as the talks entered theirfourth week in New York.    They said the Philippines was now willing to pay a spreadof 7/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates(Libor), up from the 5/8 points it originally proposed.    The sources said the proposal was made in a bid to break adeadlock with the banks, who were insisting on a minimuminterest spread of one full percentage point over Libor.    They noted that the latest plan marked a compromise betweenthe two sides' demands, but fell short of Ongpin's assertionthat the Philippines would insist on a deal better than the13/16 percentage points offered to Mexico last year by itscreditor banks.

They were referring to the last round of negotiations inNovember 1986, when one bank, identified as Citibank NA,refused to endorse the committee's proposal of 1-1/8 pointsover Libor. REUTER...&#3;
