Amoco Corp is apparently the successfulbidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to apublished report.    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to thenegotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night withTransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.    No financial details about the Amoco offer were availableand a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amocohad emerged the winner, the newspaper said.    However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Domecould be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe andMail said.    Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available forcomment.    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Domesaid it was also in talks with two other companies, but refusedto identify them.    Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco andExxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary inCanada.    British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding.    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to wantto avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the governmentgave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks toencourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts andofficials have said.    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to runafoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada isasking for tax concessions from a federal government that istrying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,analysts have said.    A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreignoil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-basedAmoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its AmocoCanada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp. Reuter&#3;
