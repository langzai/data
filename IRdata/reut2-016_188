The five leading West German economicresearch institutes, which have revised down their forecastsfor 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany,their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.    The institutes were divided in their spring report onforecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth andtwo seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.    Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with thebeginning of a recession." He added, however, that exportsremained the weak point of the economy .    Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect furtherencroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.    Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with theDIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view ofthe economy, said, "The braking effects (on the economy)produced by external factors will remain considerable for mostof the year."
