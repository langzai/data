The West German intervention board saidabout 100,000 tonnes of sugar have been offered intointervention so far.    A spokesman, speaking from Frankfurt, told Reuters offershave increased recently but contracts have not yet beenconcluded. A European Commission spokesman in Brussels earlierconfirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered tointervention boards in various member states. The interventionboard spokesman in Frankfurt said, "One million tonnes is anawful lot and the Community's coffers are almost empty. Thiscould turn into a serious political problem."    West German trade sources said they believed the one mlntonne offer by the EC sugar industry into intervention wouldhave a neutral market impact overall. Reuter&#3;
