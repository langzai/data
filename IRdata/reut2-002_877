Indonesia's Armed Forces CommanderGeneral Benny Murdani said warnings about an extremist threatto the country's forthcoming elections do not mean the securitysituation has deteriorated.   He was quoted in today's edition of the armed forcesnewspaper Harian AB as saying the warnings were only an appealfor vigilance ahead of the April 23 polls.    Major-General Setijana, military commander of central Java,said in widely-quoted remarks last week that both leftist andrightist extremists were planning to sabotage the polls in anattempt to topple President Suharto's government.    Murdani told a meeting of the ruling Golkar party inJakarta yesterday that he believed the security situation wasnow stable.    However, he also said mass meetings during the electioncampaign period should be avoided, as they could trigger whathe termed a critical situation very easily.    About 60 people died in accidents and election-relatedviolence during the last parliamentary elections in 1982. REUTER&#3;
