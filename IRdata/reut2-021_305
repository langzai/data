An Iowa State University study showedpork contains considerably less fat than indicated bylong-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, theNational Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.    Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the studyaveraged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American HeartAssociation guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of allthe raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study containedless than six pct fat, the NPPC said.    Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as theestablished authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fatcontent for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.    Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairsfor the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancybetween the study and the USDA handbook.    "Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on informationthat has been accumulated over the past 30 years. Thestatistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of todaywhich is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"Kline said.    The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categoriesfrom 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fatcontent of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops. Reuter&#3;
