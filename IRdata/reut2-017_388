It is vitally important that theindustrialised countries of the world work towards convergenceof their economies and economic policies, U.S. Ambassador tothe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentEdward Streator said.    He told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch the world waschanging rapidly and national attitudes had to alteraccordingly if growth was not to falter and world depressionset in.    Liberalisation of world trade in money, goods and servicesand technology was an overriding goal, he added.    World financial flows were now 12 times as large astraditional trade flows, the importance of commodities wasdeclining rapidly, countries such as those on the Pacific Rimwere becoming major growth areas, and the labour element inmanufacturing was declining sharply, Streator said.    All these factors were creating major social and economicpressures and demanding a rapid reassessment of traditionalattitudes, he added.    "Agriculture is a prime target for change.One of the firstthings we must do is disconnect farm subsidies from production,"Streator said.    At an OECD ministerial meeting in two weeks time therewould be an attempt to agree global principles to help reducethis major agricultural problem, Streator said.    "However, of equal and vital importance in reducing theworld's dangerous slide towards protectionism will be theoutcome of the new round of talks under the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," Streator added.    Dutch finance minister Onno Ruding, who also spoke brieflyat the lunch, stressed the importance of coordinating nationalpolicies and of the GATT talks in preventing a rapid declineinto bilateralism and global protectionism.
