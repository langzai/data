An 11-day-old strike byBrazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could leadto a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.    They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayedbut said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried byBrazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also beendisrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.    A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meantBrazil's coffee exports have been running at an average twoweeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one sourceadded.    By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bagsbehind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shippedduring March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped,the sources said.    Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bagsa day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately andnot interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffeewill inevitably be shipped during April, they added.
