British Prime Minister Margaret Thatchercame under fresh pressure for an early election today asfinancial indicators bolstered the government's forecasts of aboom in the economy following the budget earlier this week.    Two of the country's leading lending institutions announcedcuts in home loans rates following Wednesday's cut in interestrates by the main banks by half a point to 10 per cent.    Analysts said today's reduction by Abbey National from12.75 pct to 11.25, and one by the Halifax Building Societyfrom 12.25 to 11.25 in lending rates for house buyers would befollowed by other main institutions.   One financial analyst commented: "I imagine the AbbeyNational is being toasted in Downing Street (the primeminister's residence) but not in the boardrooms of other bigsocieties."    Coupled with income tax cuts announced by Chancellor of theExchequer (Finance Minister) Nigel Lawson in his budget lastTuesday as well as recent opinion polls showing Thatcher'srightwing Conservative Party well ahead of Labour and thecentrist Alliance, they said pressure was now building up onThatcher to call a general election as early as June.    Yesterday there was more good news for Thatcher in the formof a continuing drop in the number of unemployed, withgovernment minister predicting that it would fall below thethree million mark before long.
