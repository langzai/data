Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament,said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar1987.    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance ofpayments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pctat the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct bythe summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of theyear.    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchangedwhen compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87,Lawson said.    Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterlingM3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to betaken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well asthe exchange rate.    The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due tothe buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and thecorporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable businesssector in particular.    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlierassumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs perbarrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep thePSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said. Reuter&#3;
