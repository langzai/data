Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister VladimirPetrovsky said today Moscow felt "indignation and regret" at whathe called "truly hostile statements about the Soviet Union" madeby President Reagan.    Reagan told reporters yesterday he was ordering ahigh-level review of security at the U.S. Embassy in Moscowfollowing a sex-and-spy scandal there and said Soviet diplomatswould not be allowed to use a new embassy in Washington untilthe U.S. Moscow mission was made secure.    Petrovsky told reporters it was not accidental thatWashington had chosen this time, only a week before a scheduledMoscow visit by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, to makeaccusations against the Soviet Union.    Objective conditions existed for improving Soviet-U.S.Relations. "But it seems that someone in Washington fails toappreciate this process and tries to poison the atmosphere," hesaid. Reuter&#3;
