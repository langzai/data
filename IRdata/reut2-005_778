The European Community cereal tradelobby Coceral has written to Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessenasking for talks on ways of preventing their members losingmoney as a result of future realignments of currencies in theEuropean Monetary System.    In the text of a letter made available to journalists,Coceral says some members suffered considerable losses oncontracts entered into just before the last realignment inJanuary.    This was because of an unforeseeable increase in monetarycompensatory amounts (MCA's) for some member states, it says.    Coceral estimates losses sustained by West German traderswho are its members at 8.05 mln marks.    It says Andriessen should work out new regulations toprevent a repetition of such losses as a result of futurerealignments.    A Coceral spokesman said problems had arisen when tradersimporting cereals from weak currency countries into those withstrong currencies bought the weak currencies with which theywere to pay for the cereals forward.
