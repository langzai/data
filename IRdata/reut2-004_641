Japan will carry out agovernment-coordinated study of uses for superconductingmaterials, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry(MITI) said.    University and industry representatives will startdiscussions in April on basic research and possibleapplications, Masatoshi Urashima, MITI's director fordevelopment of future basic technology, said.    Superconductors, which conduct electricity with very lowresistance, could be used in computers, semiconductors and highspeed trains, he said.    Urashima said recent discoveries of superconductivematerials which do not need extremely low temperatures led toMITI's decision to coordinate research.    MITI's electric technology laboratory is currentlyresearching energy efficiency and superconductive electricalgeneration, he added. REUTER&#3;
