The Bank of Spain said it approved apackage of measures liberalising some exchange controls andeasing some restrictions on the raising of foreign funds.    It said in a statement that the circulars were the lateststeps to deregulate Spain's financial sector -- a movetriggered by entry into the European Community (EC) a year ago.    A Bank of Spain spokesman said in response to an enquiryfrom Reuters that the new measures were not yet in force andadded that he could not say when they would take effect.    The statement said one measure meant that residents inSpain would now be able to borrow up to the equivalent of 1.5billion pesetas from abroad, providing that the average lengthof the loans was at least one year, that the borrower was not aSpanish branch of a non-resident lending agent, and that theloan was denominated in a currency traded in Spain, inconvertible pesetas or in European Currency Units (ECUS).    All foreign loans not approved under those rules will beapproved automatically if the Bank of Spain does notspecifically reject applications within 15 days of receivingthem.    The statement said another measure frees most of therestrictions on how banks can capture foreign funds and lendthem.    The existing limit on foreign obligations of three timesthe value of capital and reserves of a borrower bank isabolished, although the Bank of Spain will continue to monitorthe banks' obligations.    Restrictions on the maximum time difference between thematurity of foreign assets and obligations are also abolishedand regulations governing risk by country are loosened.    The latest measures follow recent moves to abolish themaximum interest rates banks can offer for some peseta fundsand the lifting of restrictions on investments abroad bySpaniards.    The government has also allowed foreign companies to bequoted on Spanish stock exchanges and has promised furtherreforms of the domestic financial system. Reuter&#3;
