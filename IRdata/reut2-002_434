&lt;Spar Aerospace Ltd>, reporting asharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit andrevenue growth during the next five years.    "Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that itscontinuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-basedcommunications and electro-optical defense systems will lead tosignificant growth in revenues and earnings over the next fiveyears," the company said.    It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increasedorder backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln.    Spar added that lower development costs in thecommunications group and a return to normal operations in gearsand transmissions and aviation services "will remove a seriousdrain on profits" this year.    It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communicationsgroup losses resulting from continued heavy investment in newproducts and market development, a four-month strike at itsToronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization fromcustomers to start work on new programs.
