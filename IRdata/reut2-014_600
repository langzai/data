California regulators said theywere seeking disciplinary action against the accounting firmKMG Main Hurdman as the result of a 1985 audit of TechnicalEquities Corp., an investment firm that filed for bankruptcylast year.    A spokeswoman for the California Board of Accountancy,which certifies public accountants and firms in the state, saida six-page complaint was filed against the New York-basedaccounting firm.    "We basically charged that the Technical Equities audit wasnot conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditingstandards," Della Bousquet, executive officer for the board,told Reuters in a telephone interview.    She said a hearing would probably be held before anadministrative law judge within three months. Penalties couldrange from censure to revocation of KMG Main Hurdman's licenseto do business in California.    KMG Main Hurdman merged last week with Peat MarwickMitchell of New York to become the world's largest accountingfirm.    The San Francisco office of the firm declined to comment onthe board's allegations.    Bousquet said the company, among other things, was accusedof not properly investigating financial transactions and ofissuing a favorable opinion in August 1985 that relied onmisrepresentations of Technical Equities management.    She said the accounting firm, although it knew TechnicalEquities had severe cash flow and liquidity problems, wasaccused of not performing a proper audit of it.    The complaint named four individuals, including twopartners and two audit managers.    Technical Equities, based in San Jose, filed for protectionunder Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in February 1986,listing debts of 69.7 mln dlrs to 1,068 investors.    Many of the investors were prominent sports andbroadcasting figures. Reuter&#3;
