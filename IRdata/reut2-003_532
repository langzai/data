The European Court in Luxembourg hasruled a so-called "Christmas butter" scheme, under which surplusstocks were sold off cheaply, did not infringe EuropeanCommunity (EC) rules, a Commission spokesman said.    The spokesman said the Court rejected a case brought bythree European margarine manufacturers which argued the ECExecutive Commission did not have the power to launch thescheme in October 1984 without approval from EC ministers.    The plan was aimed at offloading 200,000 tonnes of butterfrom a one mln tonne stockpile at a specially reduced price of1.6 European currency units per kilogram. Reuter&#3;
