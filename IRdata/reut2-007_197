French gross domestic product will growby only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with thegovernment's forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the privateInstitut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour leDeveloppement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said.    However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986level of two pct.    IPECODE said demand and production would develop inparallel this year, in contrast to last year when productionwas unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domesticdemand, unleashing higher import demand.    Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals infrancs by member nations, and an increase in reserves ofSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment ofFrench debts.    Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund(FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.    French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct lastyear, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pctin 1988, it added.    Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct thisyear and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.    Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986,is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODEsaid, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.    However, the institute said inflation would fall back to2.5 pct at the end of 1988, "provided that real wage costsremain within the framework of productivity rises." REUTER&#3;
