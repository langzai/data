They said French, West German and Dutch officials hadinformed the committee that traders in their countries intendedto sell just over 850,000 tonnes of sugar into EC interventionstocks.    The Commission riposted by signalling that it would sellthe sugar sold into intervention back onto the EC market bytender, a move that would push down prices.
