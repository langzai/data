An accord is in sight in Brazil's20-day-old national seamen's strike, which has seriouslydelayed exports, a union official said.    The official, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio deJaneiro, said up to 30,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were stillon strike.    He said the others had returned to work over the last week,accepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies andfrom the Frota Nacional de Petroleiros (Fronape), part of thestate-owned oil company Petrobras.    The association grouping private shipowners, Syndarma, hasalso offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked overpayment for overtime.    The union official said he believed this issue would beresolved shortly. Reuter&#3;
