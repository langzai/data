Standard and Poor's Corp said that thecredit quality of most U.S. cable television companies isunlikely to improve in the near term.    S and P said that after two years and many delays anddisappointments, the cable television industry has firmlyestablished a net cash generating position.    However, rather than using their improved position todecrease the leverage of current capital structures, thecompanies' cash flows are being fully leveraged to finance awave of consolidations, S and P said.    Many cable television companies exhibit greater financialrisk because of their asset growth aspirations anddebt-financed consolidation. That delays a lower risk profilefor many of them, Standard and Poor's said.    The acquisition and financial growth policies of manycompany executives heavily influenced the ratings outlook.    Citing aggressive capital structures, acquisitions and cashflow coverages of interest expense of between 1.0 and 1.5times, S and P noted that the companies are more debt intensivenow than in their building phase. These factors keep theirratings at speculative grades, the agency concluded. Reuter&#3;
