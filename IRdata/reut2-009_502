Canada may begin monitoring steelflowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel isbeing illegally "trans-shipped" to the U.S., senior governmenttrade officials said.    The officials, asking not to be identified, said thegovernment will investigate an industry contention that steel imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is beingdiverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns aboutthe level of Canadian exports south of the border.    But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified,said that despite intense pressure from the ReaganAdministration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formallimits on Canadian shipments to the U.S.    "In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,"said one official who claimed Canadian companies were "fairtraders" in the big American market.    If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a monitoring system will be established in the next three or fourmonths.    "I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we wouldhave to do something about it," said a trade official.    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pctof the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the leveljust two years ago.    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time ofgrowing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports fromseveral countries in the face of a decline among domestic steelproducers.    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of theAmerican market be limited to 2.4 per cent.    The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreigncompanies to obtain permits to import steel into the country.Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or rawsteel, which makes up less than half the steel market.    Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in1986, while importing 944-mln dlrs worth of the product in thesame year. Reuter&#3;
