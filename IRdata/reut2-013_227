British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not theonly element standing in the way of full British membership ofthe European Monetary System (EMS).    But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be thestrongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has madeclear she does not expect to consider joining until after thenext UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.    But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters afteran informal European Community finance ministers' meeting herethat other factors apart from the upcoming election stood inthe way of full membership.    In addition to the question of the exchange rates at whichBritain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism,there was also the impact of sterling membership on the systemto be considered, he said.    British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar systembased on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterlingsystem, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work."    But Lawson added that some of the considerations that hadmade it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posedless of a problem.    As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency,which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearlyweakened," he said.    Lawson restated that the government was keeping thequestion of membership under review. REUTER&#3;
