Brazil is preparing a new economicstrategy intended to protect domestic growth, Finance Ministrysources said.    A presidential spokesman said President Jose Sarney hadauthorised the government's economic team to prepare the newplan as soon as possible.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said last night the planwould reflect "an important battle to protect the country'sdevelopment and keep it from recession."    Funaro, who helped lead the anti-inflation Cruzado Planlaunched in February 1986, has come under increasing attackover the past few days following the resignation of PlanningMinister Joao Sayad on March 17. Observers say the plan hasfailed to stabilise the country's economy.    Sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90-day pricesand a wage freeze, but met opposition from Sarney and Funaro.    Foreign Ministry sources said the new strategy was beingprepared by economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende,both former Central Bank officials said to have played leadingroles in the Cruzado Plan.   The new plan will define the terms on which Brazil will seekrescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.    On February 20, Brazil suspended servicing of 70 billiondlrs of debt to private foreign banks.    Funaro said last night Brazil wants a rescheduling programspread over four years, and added that it had to include newloans to keep the domestic economy growing.    "In the past two years Brazil paid 24 billion dlrs inservicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billiondlrs in new loans," Funaro said.  REUTER&#3;
