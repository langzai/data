European Community, EC, agricultureministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed atlimiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter athigh guaranteed EC prices, diplomats said.    The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cutdairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline lastDecember after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations.    The accord, which is due to operate from the start of thenew milk marketing year on April 1, was hailed as the mostsignificant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly ECfarm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses.    Diplomats say the December agreement itself is notthreatened but that its effect could be considerably weakenedif the proposals are altered too radically.    West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits ona farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter intopublic stores when market prices and stocks are high.    Faced with a butter "mountain" of a record 1.2 mln tonnescosting over two mln dlrs per day just to store, EC farmCommissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouragedto cut production to meet demand.    He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem beforethe ministers move on to consider this year's annual pricereview which proposes extending the new system for butter salesto other sectors such as cereals.
