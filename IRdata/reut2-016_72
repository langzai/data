Countries meeting at theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) this week are looking at avariety of new ways to resolve the problem of third world debt,Swiss National Bank president Pierre Languetin said.    Languetin said meetings of the Group of 10 and the IMFInterim Committee today reached a consensus that a reschedulinglike that of Mexico's debt must be the last of its kind. TheMexico rescheduling has still not been finally resolved sixmonths after it started. Various members suggested otheroptions to break the deadlock between debtor countries andtheir creditors, he said.    Languetin said no recommendations were agreed, but helisted some of the suggestions.    One involved individual banking systems each resolving theproblem of small banks which refused to participate inreschedulings. It was this problem that had preventedcompletion of the Mexican rescheduling, he said.    Debt-equity swaps could be expanded, as could 'on-lending',which some banks had proposed for Argentine debt. 'On-lending'allows banks to select customers for rescheduled amounts.    Small banks which did not wish to reschedule might beforced to sign "exit bonds," prohibiting them from lending tothat country again, he said.    Languetin said none of these represented a general view.But he added "People are trying to get out of the corset." REUTER&#3;
