Proposed federal regulationsgoverning the sale of foreign futures and options contracts toU.S. citizens would strap U.S. exchanges, an official of theChicago Board of Trade, CBT, said.    Frederick Grede, CBT vice president of administration andplanning, told the Futures Industry Association that rulesproposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC,would "handicap the ability of U.S. exchanges and futurescommission merchants to compete internationally."    The CFTC rules generally would require additionalregistration and disclosure.    Grede said that speculative positions, hedging andaggregation do not exist on most overseas exchanges, and thatthe regulations would impose onerous requirements relating tothe segregation of customer funds.    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips, acknowledging that theproposal was "controversial," said the commission wouldconsider revising the proposals.              Reuter&#3;
