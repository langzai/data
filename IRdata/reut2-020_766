A major South African mining houseon Monday reported two of its gold mines suffered huge lossesas a result of a black miners' strike in August which crippledabout half the country's crucial gold mines.    Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, one of thesix major mining houses, said the two mines suffered a combinednet loss of 9.7 mln dlrs in the three months to end-Septembercompared with a profit of 8.6 mln dlrs in the precedingquarter.    It was the first indication of the real economic impact ofthe biggest wage strike in the history of the gold miningindustry, which accounts for nearly half the value of SouthAfrica's total exports.    "The results were pretty disastrous, primarily due to theimpact of the strike," Ken Maxwell, head of JohannesburgConsolidated's gold division, told a news conference inJohannesburg.    "We haven't recovered from the strike yet," he said, addingthat 70 percent of underground mining at the group's biggestmine, Randfontein Estates, was halted by the three-week strike.    Johannesburg Consolidated and its controlling company, thegiant Anglo American Corp., were hard-hit by the three-weekminers' strike, but refused to disclose production losses.    Anglo American is due to report its quarterly gold-mineprofits later this week. Reuter&#3;
