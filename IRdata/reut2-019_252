Illinois Governor James Thompson willlikely sign a bill setting December 1, 1990, as the triggerdate opening the state to wider interstate banking, agubernatorial spokesman said.    The bill passed both chambers of the Illinois legislaturethis week by wide margins.    The bill provides that Illinois banks and bank holdingcompanies can be acquired by similar institutions from anystate with a reciprocal law. Current Illinois law limitsinterstate banking to six Midwestern states.    The governor had supported a July 1, 1988, date for fullinterstate banking. Large banking firms, particularly Citicorp&lt;CCI>, have lobbied for the earlier date.    But legislation with the later date was approved in thestate's house and senate. The governor has the authority to usean amendatory veto and pencil in an earlier trigger date.    "I'm sure the bill will get his approval," the spokesmansaid. "The only question is whether he will use his authorityto change the trigger date. He will hear from people who wantthe different dates. I don't think he'll take action beforelate summer." Reuter&#3;
