The New York Stock Exchange said itand its New York Futures Exchange affiliate will move theexpiration of their respective index options and index futurescontracts to the opening of trading in the underlying stock oneach expiration Friday from the close of trading.    The exchange said it has submitted the changes to theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission for approval.    The exchange said, "The NYSE has long advocated settlementin the morning rather than at the close of trading as apractical way to deal with order imbalances and pricevolatility which historically occur on so-called "triplewitching days."    The triple witching hour falls four times a year whenindividual stock options, stock index futures and options onstock indexes all expire on the third Friday of the month,which has led to volatile last-hour market swings.    On the last triple witching Friday, December 19, the NYSEtraded almost 85 mln shares at the close of the market. Thenext triple witching hour will take place Friday, March 20.    The exchange said, "Morning settlement would expose orderimbalances to the full sunlight of public disclosure, ensurethe broadest dissemination of market information, andfacilitate the participation of all interested investors."
