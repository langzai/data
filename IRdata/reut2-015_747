Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introducedin the House of Representatives legislation proposed by theReagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, aspokesman for Porter said.    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without anychanges from the administration's proposal sent to Congresslast month.    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would becompensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments togrowers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected theproposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry. Reuter&#3;
