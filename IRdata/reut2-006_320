Indonesia has issued licences totraders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage ofcooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May,Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters.    "We have given permission for a small amount of imports toprevent a shortage during Ramadan," he said. He gave no figuresfor the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it wouldcome from Malaysia.    Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer,earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences.    Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after tradersin London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April.    Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largestMoslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day andhave large meals after sunset.    Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures,against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985.    Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did notexplain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan. REUTER&#3;
