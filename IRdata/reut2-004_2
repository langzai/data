In a discovery that could complicate thesearch for an AIDS vaccine, a team of U.S. Army doctors saidthey have uncovered a potentially-fatal interaction between theAIDS virus and a virus used to protect against smallpox.     Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Researchsaid a 19-year-old man, who apparently had been exposed to theAIDS virus, developed a pox-like disease and died afterreceiving the smallpox vaccine. The military now tests recruitsfor AIDS before vaccinating them.    The findings, reported in The New England Journal ofMedicine, are significant because scientists have begun workingon an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine.     "Our case report raises provocative questions concerningthe ultimate safety of such vaccines," said the group led byDr. Robert Redfield.     The report also throws into question the belief held bysome scientists that the smallpox vaccine, which exposes peopleto a milder, protective form of the disease known as cowpox,could be further modified to protect people against a host ofother diseases.
