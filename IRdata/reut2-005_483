Navistar International Corp said it isrecalling 33,000 medium tucks and 19,000 school buses equippedwith power assisted hydraulic brakes to modify the electricalpower supply to the backup breaking system.    The company said an electrical failure in the main enginewiring harness could stall the engine, knocking out the primarypower assist to the brakes while simultaneously shutting offelectrical power to the backup pump. This would render thevehicle's service brakes inoperative.    It said it is aware of only one accident arising from theproblem. Reuter&#3;
