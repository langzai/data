U.S. Agriculture UndersecretaryDaniel Amstutz said he was "totally sympathetic" with U.S. woodproducers' desire to have their exports eligible for governmentcredit guarantees.    But he told the Senate Appropriations Agriculturesubcommittee that including wood products in the department'sshort- or intermediate-term export guarantee programs wouldconflict with U.S. multilateral trade obligations.    Currently, U.S. wood products are not eligible forgovernment export credit guarantee because they are considered"manufactured products," Amstutz said.    He said USDA had devoted an "enormous amount" of time toconsidering making wood products eligible for the guaranteesand that Congress was considering a measure to do so. Reuter&#3;
