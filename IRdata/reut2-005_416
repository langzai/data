The Belgian government has lowered itsforecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, PrimeMinister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament.    He said this revision, which brings government forecastsmore closely into line with those by private institutions,takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economyand international trade.    But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will belimited due to recent agreements on wages and workingconditions agreed by employers and unions.    Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP togrow in volume terms.    However, last month the government's Planning Bureau saidit had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0pct.    In 1986, Belgium's gross national product rose 2.15 pct involume terms against a 5.9 pct nominal rise. REUTER&#3;
