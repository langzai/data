The Belgian National Bank cut interestrates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30pct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in atelex message.    The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificaterates on March 23, when it also reduced rates for all threeperiods by 0.10 points.    A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment wouldbring the rates closer in line with currently prevailinginterbank interest rates.    The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether themove would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currentlystands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weeklymeeting at which the rate is discussed next Wednesday.    The discount rate generally moves in tandem with thethree-month treasury certificate rate. However, there is noformal link and the discount rate was not adjusted followingthe March 23 changes.
