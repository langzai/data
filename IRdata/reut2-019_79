Philippines' Board of Investments (BOI)has approved new guidelines on making cars but is stillawaiting rules on the tax component of the programme, trade andindustry secretary Jose Concepcion said.    He said the authorities were still deciding how much taxwill be levied on locally-assembled cars.    The new car development programme replaces an earlierscheme and is designed to limit the number of car manufacturersin the local market.    The scheme is to be unveiled before the end of the month.    The two accredited local car manufacturers are &lt;PilipinasNissan Inc>, which gets car kits from Nissan Motor Company Ltd&lt;NSAN.T> and &lt;Philippine Automotive Manufacturing Corp> whichgets supplies from Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>.    Three companies which pulled out due to what they saw aspoor market conditions were Ford Philippines, a subsidiary ofFord Motor Co &lt;F>, General Motors Pilipinas, a subsidiary ofGeneral Motors Corp &lt;GM> and &lt;Delta Motors Corp>.    Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, which was the foreign partnerof Delta Motors, has applied for a place in the new programmeand is negotiating the purchase of Delta's assembly plant.    Concepcion declined to say how many car assemblers would beallowed to operate, but said they will be required to finance75 pct of the foreign exchange needed to importcompletely-knocked-down kits.    The balance will be provided by the central bank, he said.    The trade minister, who is also chairman of the BOI, saidthe programme is intended to develop a car parts industry byrequiring car firms to use locally-made spare parts. He saidthe plan should keep car prices at "reasonable levels."    Tax currently accounts for 40 pct of the total cost of acar. REUTER&#3;
