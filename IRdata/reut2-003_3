Technology transfer problems have delayedthe finalising of contracts between South Korea's state-ownedKorea Electric Power Corp (Kepco) and U.S. Firms for suppliesof equipment and services for Kepco's latest two 950-megawattnuclear power plants, a Kepco spokesman said.    He told Reuters the contracts for Kepco's tenth andeleventh stations, costing between two and three billion dlrs,were due for completion by the end of February.    Kepco has been negotiating with Combustion Engineering Inc(CSP) for pressurised light-water reactors and General ElectricCo (GE) for turbines.    KEPCO has also been negotiating with (Sargent and LundyEngineers) for engineering and design consultancy services.    "We have been waging a tug-of-war on the transfer ofadvanced technology. But I am optimistic we will sign contractswith them within this month," the spokesman said.    He said the transfer of advanced technology is vital forSouth Korea, which wants to build future nuclear power plantswith its own technology.    Work on the two plants is due to start about June 1988 forcompletion in 1995 and 1996, although the sites have yet to bechosen, he said. REUTER&#3;
