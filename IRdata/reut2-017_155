Nigeria's military government retreatedin the face of hostile public opinion and restored the minimumwage of 125 naira (about 32 dlrs) a month.    It revoked an order made only last December which exemptedcompanies with fewer than 500 employees -- the vast majority --from paying the minimum wage.    Labour Minister Brigadier Ike Nwachukwu, announcing thedecision in Lagos today, said it was made out of respect forpublic opinion and to maintain industrial harmony.    Nwachukwu said the thinking behind the exemption was inline with Nigeria's far-reaching structural adjustment programand the measure was intended to promote small-scale industryand agriculture.
