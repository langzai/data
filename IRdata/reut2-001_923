Baker International corp said it hasfiled suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Coto complete its proposed merger with Baker.    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the mergeragreement because Baker would not agree to an alternativedivestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board hadpreviously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consentdecree that would have required broader divestitures.    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanationfrom Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the JusticeDepartment consent decree.    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at whichshareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting thecounting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the votewas overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for themerger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "moreburdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves.    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree wouldreduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrsor three pct.    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures ofthe units named in the consent decree.    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain ofits directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes tolive up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetarydamages it did not name.    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the bestinterests of shareholders of both companies. Reuter&#3;
