Financial analysts say they arepleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federalbudget deficit but believe the actions will do little to helpimprove the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrowto approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the comingfiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a planthat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs nextyear.        "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs isinfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have littleimpact on the economy and the trade deficit," said StanleyCollander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.    "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collandersaid in an interview.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedlytold Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long wayto help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help easesome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the tradeimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraughtwith danger.    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels.    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit.    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates.    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none.    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.    "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government'smost vexing and persistent problems.    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget.    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law.    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.    "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.    "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street."    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year.    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts. Reuter&#3;
