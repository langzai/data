Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas PipelineCo, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transportnatural gas under the open access rules of the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission, FERC.    In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transportcompany, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines alsotransport its own gas to customers.    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERCguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until theregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces forgas it has bought but could not sell.    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or paycontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-termcontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe ascustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week thatTenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines toopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue.    But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the stepsFERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERCis moving the industry through this restructuring now, evenbefore all transitional problems are solved."    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposureunder the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figurefor Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines fromLouisiana and Texas up to New England.    "We remain convinced that the most critical transitionalissue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved byFERC in the near future.    "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for theindustry's continued ability to provide its customers withreliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Copresident R.C. Thomas.
