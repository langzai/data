Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducingfour information technology systems that will be led by today'shighest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.    The company said information management products will bethe focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-businesscommunications campaign under the threme "The New Vision ofKodak."    Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded fourbillion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating thosesales were independent, that company would rank among the top100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.    The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communicationscampaign, it added, is to inform others of the company'scommitment to the business and industrial sector.    Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on theinformation management systems unveilded today --    -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store morethan a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).    - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked informationmanagement system using optical disks or microfilm or both.    -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based systemthat allows users to integrate optical disks into their currentinformation management systems.    -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based,computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.    Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is awrite-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division willmarket on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in1988.    Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate upto 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytesof randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointedout, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.    Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected tosell in the 700,000 dlr range.    Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical diskversion which provides data storage and retrieval through adisk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing2.6 gigabytes.    Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member ofthe family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manuallyloaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrswith deliveries beginning in mid-year.    The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal withthe more powerful KIMS system 5000.    It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware andsoftware as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987and sell in the 150,000 dlr range. Reuter&#3;
