Avery Inc said the company will notshow a profit in the next quarter and will probably not show aprofit in 1987.    Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairmanNelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would becomeprofitable.    Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, wouldincrease Avery's operating earnings but that associatedacquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profitsfor some time.    At the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in theauthorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.    In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported aloss of 489,000 dlrs. The company has changed its fiscal yearto end Sept 30.    The increase in common shares would cover, among otherthings, the exercise of Triangle Industries Inc's &lt;TRI> andDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc's warrants issued in relation toAvery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical late lastyear.
