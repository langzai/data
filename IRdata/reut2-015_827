The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the SovietUnion to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, theUSDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated becauseSoviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the lastmonth.    USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,USDA said.    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnesmiscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop sufferedthrough a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.    The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in aboveaverage winter-kill," USDA said.    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter lossesmaybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buyinggrain recently.    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnesgrain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheatand 12 mln tonnes coarse grain. Reuter&#3;
