Japan warned the United States it maytake retaliatory measures if the United States imposes itsplanned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior governmentofficial said.    Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Tradeand Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would considermeasures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade andother actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs onsome Japanese exports as planned next week.    However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue tradetalks with the United States despite its failure to convinceAmerica to call off the threatened tariffs during two days ofemergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.    Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions inretaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in marketsoutside the United States and to open its home market toAmerican goods.    Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably notlistened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up thepact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanationof why it planned to impose the tariffs.
