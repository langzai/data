Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw deGraaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilderlabour subsidy for Rotterdam's strike-hit general cargo sectoras from July 1.    Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was notsettled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.    The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ,Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision andadded there was now no alternative to proceeding withredundancy plans.    The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies fromthe 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.    Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked lossfigures given for the port for this year.    The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ,put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around30 mln.    The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln andsaid the employers had inflated the figures as part of theirplan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector. Reuter&#3;
