World Bank President Barber Conablecalled on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, forits own sake as well as that of the world economy.    "Japan has the means to make a major contribution todevelopment in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanesebusinessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additionalsupport."    With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japancould do more to help assist indebted Third World countriesdevelop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said.    Conable said additional commercial bank investment wouldalso be to Japan's advantage.    It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplusinto Third World economies -- notably those in South America,China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than thosein the developed world, he said.    Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank'sconcessionary lending affiliate, the International DevelopmentAssociation (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand itscontribution to another affiliate, the International Bank forReconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.    Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structuraladjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries toopen their economies more to free competition and trade.    "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bankloans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conabletold Reuters after his speech.    Such loans currently account for slightly over 20 pct. REUTER&#3;
