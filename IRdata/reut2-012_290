J.P. Morgan and Co Inc, parent ofMorgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, said that it will place1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil on anon-accrual basis, matching similar action by BankAmerica Corp&lt;BAC> earlier today.    The move, which follows Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt on February20, is expected to reduce first quarter net income by about 20mln dlrs, of which four mln dlrs represents interest accruedprior to 1987 but still uncollected, the bank said.    Morgan earned 233.9 mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1986.    Morgan also said that, based on current interest rates andassuming cash interest payments are not received for the restof the year, 1987 net income would be reduced by about 72 mlndlrs. 1986 net income was 872.5 mln dlrs.    Although U.S. banks do not have to put loans on nonaccrualuntil they are over 90 days past due, Morgan said some of theloans affected by the Brazil payment freeze may reach the90-day limit during the second and third quarters.    Morgan said it assumes talks between Brazil and commercialbank lenders will proceed "expeditiously" and interest paymentswill resume at the earliest practicable date. Reuter&#3;
