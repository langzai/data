Britain's gold and currency reserves rosea record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.    The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank ofEngland intervention on currency markets to curb sterling'sstrength. It was above market expectations which had been for arise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.    The Treasury declined comment on the figures.    Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, comparedwith April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.    Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mlndlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repaymentsof eight mln, after three mln last month.    Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.    The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings andrepayments.    It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrsrise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents theseventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs inthat period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987. REUTER&#3;
