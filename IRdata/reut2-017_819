Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mlndlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased itslines of credit for import financing, finance minister ManuelAzpurua said.    'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation ofcredit, but that cannot be done overnight,' Azpurua said in atelevision interview.    He said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signedthis week with the German state bank Kreditanstalt furWiederaufbau (KFW), to finance an expansion of the statealuminum company Venalum.    The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, andanother for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.    Azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansionof Alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects inthe state steel and petrochemical industries.    Yesterday, he said Venezuela obtained two new credits of5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from Credit du Nordof France and the other from Britain's Midland Bank.    The Venezuelan government has been criticised at home forfailing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence onrepaying foreign debt according to the terms of a reschedulingaccord reached last February.    Azpurua recently visited Tokyo hoping to acquire newcredits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements.Japanese officials refused to allow a new issue of Venezuelanbonds until the country regains its 'Triple A' credit rating.
