Indian officials responded coolly  toa reported U.S. Offer to sell India a supercomputer lesspowerful than it sought, saying it showed Washington's lack ofsensitivity to Indian concerns.    Asked about a New York Times report that the United Stateshad offered New Delhi a supercomputer generations behind thetype it requested, an official told Reuters, "If the U.S. isdoing that they have not been sensitive to Indian concerns."    He declined to confirm the report directly but said Indiahad received an offer of a supercomputer from the United States"and we are considering it."    Sounding disappointed and dismayed he added, "We do not wishat this stage to say whether it is the computer we were lookingfor, or a more or less powerful model."    The official, who asked to remain anonymous, added: "Anannouncement will be made in 10 days to two weeks time."    India has sought for more than two years to buy an advancedsupercomputer primarily for monsoon forecasting. But the salehas been held up by U.S. Security concerns prompted by India'scloseness to the Soviet Union, its chief arms supplier. Reuter&#3;
