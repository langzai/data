Reichhold Chemical Inc said itsboard adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferredstock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on eachcommon share outstanding.    The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed toprotect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attemptsto aquire control without making an adequate offer for allshares.    Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to anyspecific takeover attempt.    Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buyone one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series ofpreferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, withdividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of oneshare of the company's common stock.    The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold'sprior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more ofthe voting power or announces a tender offer which would resultin 20 pct ownership, the company said.    Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at fivects apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, orbefore an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional twopct or more of the voting power of the company, or inconnection with certain transactions afterward.    The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.    Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailedto stockholders. Reuter&#3;
