Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker said a combination of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp, FDIC, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp,FSLIC, could be contemplated in the longer term but is not ananswer to the thrift industry's immediate problems.    "I don't think it's an answer to 1977 or 1988," Volckersaid at a press conference.    But a merger of the two deposit-insurance agencies could bean option as part of a general structural reform of the U.S.banking system.    The aim of a merger would not be for commercial banks tosubsidize ailing savings and loan associations but to improveofficial oversight of depository institutions, Volcker said.    "The attractive element is that you get almost bydefinition a consistency of supervision and regulation that youdon't have now," he explained. Reuter&#3;
