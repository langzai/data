It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day commentperiod. It also put out an alternative policy statement byCommissioner Charles Stalon.    FERC said in a press release that "the proposed policystatement estblishes an exception to the commission's generalpolicy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must berecovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates."    FERC added that "specifically, in cases where pipelinesassume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, thecommission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover theremaining costs through their demand rates."    It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reformingexisting contracts to help spread the impact of thesetake-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.    Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said "this proposalrepresents the commission's sincere attempt to help theindustry through this difficult period of transition to a morecompetitive market."    Hesse said "it is my hope that our proposed policy willencourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-paycontractual disputes that have impeded the industry'stransition to a more competitive environment.  It is vital tothe industry that we get this problem behind us." reuter&#3;
