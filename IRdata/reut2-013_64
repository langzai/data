Several pharmaceutical companies, drawnin the 1970s to the fast growing cosmetics industry, are nolonger finding it fashionable to sell makeup.    "The fad right now is to purify and concentrate on the mostattractive business. Right now that's the drug business," saidDavid Saks, an analyst with Morgan, Olmstead.    Yesterday, Eli Lilly and Co joined the ranks of other drugcompanies by choosing to sell off its lower growth ElizabethArden cosmetics business.    "It's not that Elizabeth Arden is bad. To some it may betheir pride and joy, but to Eli Lilly, it's a diversion oftheir management energies and financial resources from theirgemstone, which is the drug business," Saks said.    "Arden is a good company. I'm sure it's going to be a hotproperty. I'm sure people will be lining up to buy it," saidLynne Hyman, E.F. Hutton cosmetics analyst.    Analysts said the Arden business could command about 600mln dlrs, and likely buyers would be interested in itswell-known name and distribution channels.                                       Analysts said Avon Products Inc, a door-to-door makeupdistributor, and the Japanese company Shiseido Co of Tokyo,might be willing buyers. An Avon spokesman said the company isinterested in Arden, but it has not yet seen offeringdocuments.    Analysts said most of the changes of control in thecosmetics industry have been determined for the time being."There's not much out there that hasn't changed hands or isn'trelatively stable," said Hyman.    Squibb &lt;SQB> last year sold its Charles of the Ritzbusiness to Yves Saint Laurent for 630 mln dlrs, and BeechamPlc said last month it was selling its Germain Monteil unit toRevlon Group &lt;REV>.    American Cyanamid &lt;ACY>, a chemical and drug concern, isselling its Jacqueline Cochran Inc unit.    One big cosmetics concern whose fate hasn't been sealed isRevlon Group Inc. The company received a takeover offer fromMcAndrews and Forbes, which is controlled by its chairman,Ronald Perelman.    A major Revlon shareholder, McAndrews and Forbes, isoffering 18.50 dlrs per share to take the company private. ButWall Street has been estimating values for the company of 20dlrs per share and more. The stock was trading today at 20-7/8,off 1/2.    Analysts said Revlon's cosmetics lines and name might beattractive to a corporate buyer, but they doubt one would jumpinto the situation one analyst described as a "can of worms."    Analysts said drug companies are getting high prices forthe cosmetics companies. They said buyers are attracted bystrong brand names because of profit stability and prestige.REUTER...^M&#3;
