Brazilian business leaders attendinga weekend meeting with President Jose Sarney called on thegovernment to seek help from the International Monetary Fund(IMF) in resolving its debt problems.    The government has so far rejected suggestions that it letthe IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt,the biggest in the Third World.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program forBrazil, adopted four years ago, caused a recession and hebelieves another IMF program would stifle growth.    Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's68 billion dlr commercial debt, a move which has found littlefavour among the country's business community.    Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF, arguingthis would give the country access to new funds and allow theeconomy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the coursethey favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.    "We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does, ifnecessary going to the IMF," Mario Amato, president of the SaoPaulo State Industries' Federation, was quoted as saying.     An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically verydifficult for the Sarney government and there are no firmindications such a policy reversal is in the offing.    The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stanceis Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who was not present atyesterday's meeting. Brazilian newspapers highlighted hisabsence and reported that several of the 24 businessmen presentseized the opportunity to tell Sarney they would like to seeFunaro leave his job. REUTER&#3;
