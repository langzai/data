With the death of Sen. EdwardZorinsky (D-Neb.), Midwestern grain farmers have lost an allywho from his senior post on the Senate Agriculture Committeehad fought hard against cutbacks in farm benefits.    Zorinsky's passing could trim the Democrats' majority inthe Senate and change the makeup of the Senate farm panel.    Zorinsky, who died of a heart attack last Friday, was thesecond-ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee andchairman of the crucial subcommittee on agricultural productionand stabilization of prices.    Once a Republican, Zorinsky was fiscal conservative. But hewas an outspoken critic of Reagan administration proposals totrim target prices, and at the time of his death was girdinghimself for another push for mandatory supply controls.    If Melcher decides, however, to continue as chairman of thesubcommittee on agricultural research, conservation, forestryand general legislation, other Democrats would have a crack atthe vacated chairmanship.    By order of seniority, those senators would be David Pryor(Ark.), David Boren (Okla.), Howell Heflin (Ala.) and TomHarkin (D-Iowa), a forceful advocate of mandatory supplycontrols. Reuter&#3;
