The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backedPresident Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targetsin the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policyin the volatile region.    Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsedMonday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms inretaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti shipflying the American flag.    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against theUnited States with impunity."    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics andset a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger rolein making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not requireReagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could leadto a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.    While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growingU.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagancomply with the War Powers Act.
