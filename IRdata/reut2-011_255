Aluminium capacity expansion planned forthe period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply anyacceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on thescale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony BirdAssociates' 1987 Aluminium Review.    By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need tobe around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mlntonnes are scheduled, Bird said.    Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 andincreased imports by less developed countries.    Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerateby as much as general growth, but non-socialist worldconsumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Birdsaid.    Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace ofchange after 1973, the review said, and now they have completedthis transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupiedwith the strategies of retrenchment and survival which haveserved them well in recent years.    In order to encourage the construction of additionalsmelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higherlevel.    Production costs are likely to rise again in the yearsahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricitysuppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies,according to the review.    At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-pricescenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said.    Such a price development is not expected to cause anymarked competitive problems for the metal because of the likelyrise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in thepipeline for steel and copper.    In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said,as the world economy has not responded well to theopportunities offered by cheap oil.    Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higherin 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes. Reuter&#3;
