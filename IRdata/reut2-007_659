Mexican officials and representativesof about 360 creditor banks worldwide started to signagreements for 7.7 billion dlrs in new loans, Citibank said asco-chairman of Mexico's bank advisory committee.    The package, which was agreed in principle with thecommittee last October 16, is built on a core loan of sixbillion dlrs, of which five billion dlrs will be lent for 12years with five years' grace.    The remaining one billion dlrs is in the form of aco-financing with the World Bank, which will guarantee 500 mlndlrs. This loan is for 15 years with nine years' grace.    The package also includes two contingency facilitiestotalling 1.7 billion dlrs.    One is a growth-contingency co-financing with the WorldBank for 500 mln dlrs, of which half will be guaranteed by theWorld Bank.    The loan may be drawn to fund high-priority investmentprojects if Mexican economic growth fails to reach certaingrowth targets for the first quarter of 1987.    Disbursements would be for 12 years with seven years'grace. Bankers said they expect the loan, which is availableuntil March 1988, will be drawn down.        The second contingency facility, for 1.2 billion dlrs, isdesigned to support investment in the public and privatesectors.    The loan may be drawn down until April 1988 but only ifMexico experiences a shortfall in public-sector externalreceipts and provided that Mexico first qualifies for drawingsunder a 600 mln sdr oil-contigency facility from theInternational Monetary Fund.    This IMF loan would be triggered if the price of oil fallsbelow nine dlrs a barrel for three months.    Because of the level of public sector external receipts inthe fourth quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987,Mexico will not draw the first two tranches of the continencyfacility, totalling 451 mln dlrs, Citibank said.    As previously reported, bank commitments to the new moneypackage will also be reduced by 250 mln dlrs, representing theinterest payments that Mexico will save this year, thanks tothe reduced spread on the rescheduling.    Under the rescheduling, Mexico is restructuring 43.7billion dlrs of previously rescheduled debt over 20 years withseven years' grace.    Maturities on another 8.6 billion dlrs of loans granted in1983 and 1984 will remain the same. The interest rate will beat 13/16 pct over Eurodollar deposit rates - the margin thatapplies to the entire package.    Rounding out the deal, the banks have agreed to prolong sixbillion dlrs of trade lines and to refinance some 10 billiondlrs of private-sector debt that comes under the Mexicangovernment's exchange-guarantee scheme, Ficorca.    The size of the package thus comes to about 76 billiondlrs, the largest ever assembled in the international creditmarkets, Citibank said.    The loan is still only 99 pct subscribed and the loan bookswill be kept open for several more weeks to round up the final100 mln dlrs and the approximately 60 banks that have so farrefused to join the deal.
