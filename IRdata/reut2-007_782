American Telephone and Telegraph Co doesnot plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts ashare on its common stock, said James E. Olson, chairman.    "It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level sothat it could be sustained through the ups and downs of thebusiness cycle," Olson told a meeting of securities analysts.    "We see no reason to change that policy," he said.    Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson saidthe company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paidin dividends by increasing earnings.    Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut itscommon dividend, especially after the company posted a fourthquarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five ctsa share for the full year.    The loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7billion dlrs.    Olson said he expects ATT's cash flow to remain strongdespite the poor earnings. Reuter&#3;
