Clevite Industries Inc, whichearlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from J.P.Industries Inc &lt;JPI>, said it amended its Shareholder RightsPlan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur untilthe board determines that it is in the best interests of thecompany and stockholders.    The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite toissue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allowsstockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at halfprice.    Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively meanthat the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of itsrights plan can only be triggered by affirmative boardapproval.    The company said it acted inview of the proposedacquisition and because certain debt restrictions could blockits ability to redeem the rights. Reuter&#3;
