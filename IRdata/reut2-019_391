The Administration asked Congress toreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring itinto line with international tariff categories, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said.    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and moreaccurately define new composites, items not widely traded whenthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule iscalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meetthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but theyshould pay about the same rates of duties.    Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier todeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety ofdiffering systems which they now face."    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinationalnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.    Yeutter said government and business moves are based ondata from tariff schedules and the new system will improveknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards underthe new system, with about half expected to join the system byJanuary 1988. reuter&#3;
