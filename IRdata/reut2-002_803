Federal Reserve Board member RobertHeller said the trend toward global financial markets requiredthat all participants be treated even-handedly on such mattersas bank capital requirements.    The recent U.S.-U.K. agreement on capital adequacy provideda model for others, including Japan, Heller told a GeorgetownUniversity conference on financial markets.    "If they (the Japanese bank) want to do more business inEurope or the United States they have got to adhere tointernational standards," he said.    Heller said there were talks currently between the UnitedStates and Japan on bank rules.    He said the trend toward internationalization in financialservices would cause markets to move to centers with the leastregulation.    "That is not desirable.  We want to have a sensible amountof regulation," Heller said. Reuter&#3;
