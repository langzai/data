A U.S. Appeals court last nightblocked the 860 mln dlr merger of Delta Airlines Inc &lt;DAL.N>and &lt;Western Airlines> just hours before it was to go intoeffect because of a dispute over union representation.    The ruling came in a lawsuit in which the Air TransportEmployees union said Western's management should fulfil apromise to honour union contracts if a merger took place.    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not beenforced in a takeover by a larger company. Airlines officialscould not be reached for comment on the ruling, which halts themerger until arbitration on the dispute is completed. REUTER&#3;
