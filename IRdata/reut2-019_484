Bangladesh's trade gap is expected towiden in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after thegovernment relaxed restrictions on some imports includingluxury cars.    The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and1.113 billion dlrs of imports.    Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changeswere aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boostforeign exchange earnings and imports of essential machineryand raw materials, to increase industrial production.    The government was easing procedures to enhance incentivesespecially for exporters of textiles and frozen food andimporters of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim toldreporters.    Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policycovered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billiondlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by thegovernment were not included in the policy, they added.    They said the country's total import bill (both commercialand other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs inthe new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.    The minister said ending restrictions on imports of carsand dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm theeconomy.    Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices forits main export jute, "which will certainly affect our exportearnings" in the coming year.    Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mlnin 1986/87, according official figures.    But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, whichaccounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, wouldplay a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target. REUTER&#3;
