Total Petroleum NA &lt;TPN> shut downseveral small crude oil pipelines operating near theTexas/Oklahoma border last Friday as a precaution againstdamage from local flooding, according to Gary Zollinger,manager of operations.    Total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the OuachitaRiver from Wynnewood to Ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpdas well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide withcapacities of several thousand bpd or less, Zollinger said.    The Basin Pipeline, a major pipeline running 300,000 bpd,run by a consortium of other oil companies, was closed today.    One other small pipeline that Total also closed has acapacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River inFargo, Texas, Zollinger said.    He said the closed pipelines run under river water andcould be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banksand expose the piping.    Zollinger said Total is waiting for the river waters torecede before they reactivate the pipelines. Reuter&#3;
