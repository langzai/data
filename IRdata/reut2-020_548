In a joint statement, Merrill Lynch andCo Inc chairman and chief executive William Schreyer and chiefoperating officer Daniel tully said that despite theunprecedented stock market decline, they are confident that anupturn lies ahead.    "In the view of our market experts, yesterday'sunprecedented stock market decline was an over-reaction tofears of higher interest rates, more inflation and a lowerdollar. Indeed, after examining many factors, there is reasonto believe than an upturn lies ahead," the statement said.    The Merrill Lynch executives also said in the statementthat the fact that bonds rallied, commodities weakened and thedollar remained relatively firm suggests that the central banksmay now act to provide the system with additional liquidity.    "While further carry-over selling from yesterday andworries about a stock decline in Japan may put further pressureon the market in the near-term, we believe that this centralbank cooperation would provide the fuel for a recovery in stockprices and a revival of confidence relecting fundamentalvalues," the statement said.
