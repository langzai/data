The International Wheat Council (IWC)lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grainproduction by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, comparedwith 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.    In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leavingunchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against arecord 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat andcoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mlnagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mlnrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 islikely to be down from last year as low world prices andrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see adrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. Thereis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but theIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grainoutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in theEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area isexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Unionplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mlnhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields arelikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improvedweather and a further increase in the use of intensivecultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Sovietmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would bebolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWCsaid.    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks atend&#127;of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mlntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mlntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs ofanother large crop this coming season with higher outputexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.
