In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariffreductions and work out a new timetable for the completeelimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.    The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros,Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda,Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.    PTA sources said the agreement averted a split betweenmembers wanting more progress towards free trade and weakerstates concerned about the effects on customs revenue.
