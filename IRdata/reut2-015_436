The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely tofall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total worldgrain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the SovietUnion, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast torise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening theimpact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenlydistributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.    "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for manydeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, depend cruciallyon the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated ata record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than lastseason and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.    FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revisedupwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood ofsubstantial buying by China and the Soviet Union. REUTER&#3;
