The government proposed a 1987 budgetof up to 41.7 billion Syrian pounds, a 4.8 pct decrease fromlast year's allocation.    Finance minister Qahtan Seyoufi told parliament last nightthe reduction was due mainly to a cut in investmentallocations.    Planned recurrent spending of 24.2 billion pounds, almostunchanged from 1986, took account of national security needsand "Syria's role in steadfastness and liberation," he said.    The budget, which is still subject to approval byparliament and by President Hafez al-Assad, also aims to meetmounting spending on education, health and essential imports.    Power and water projects would take up 43.5 pct ofinvestment allocations of 17.5 billion pounds and agricultureabout 20 pct, Seyoufi said.    The budget's basic goals were to restrict current spending,curb inflation and step up reliance on local resources, hesaid. REUTER&#3;
