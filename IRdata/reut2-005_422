External risks for the economy haveincreased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is stillpossible, according to President of the West German Federationof Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the furtherfall of the dollar since the start of this year and therevaluation of the mark against European currencies meant WestGerman exporters were facing a "rough wind."    However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and privateconsumption in particular would support the economy, he said.He saw good prospects for consumer industries.    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had toconcentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In thiscontext, he welcomed a decision by the government to increasethe scope of tax cuts due in 1988.    He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduledfor 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners thismonth, was an "important step in the right direction."    The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cutthe maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was"rather half-hearted." REUTER&#3;
