The net inflow of foreign investmentinto Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarterof 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billiona year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.    The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billionturnaround in direct investment.    The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billioninflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account ofgovernment foreign currency borrowings, it said.    Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billiondlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal inthe third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourthquarter of 1985, the Bureau said.

GM used the funds to pay out or take over certainAustralian liabilities of its local unit &lt;GeneralMotors-Holden's Ltd>, it said.
