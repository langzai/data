East Germany plans to devolve moreresponsibility to factories and boost profitability under a lawobliging plants to generate their own funds for investments innew machinery, repairs or expansion, the Berliner Zeitungnewspaper said.    The state would no longer finance projects under five mlnmarks under the law which took effect on January 1.    The paper also hinted at further, more ambitious changes ifthis experiment proved successful.    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has cited East Germany'scautious industrial decentralisation as an alternative to theHungarian model based on Western-style market economics.    The law stresses that East Germany remains committed to thecentralised state-planned economic system with no marketexperiments.    "This new regulation is part of our general investmentpolicy," Berliner Zeitung said, citing the growing importance ofrobots and high technology rather than the large-scale plantconstruction of the 1950s and 1960s.    "This step could be the start of even greater changes in GDRinvestment policy. We must wait and see," it added.    Factory investment funds would be drawn from profits abovecertain minimum returns pledged to the state under annual plansand from amortisation -- funds the factory is allowed to keepto compensate for depreciation in the cost of machinery.    Amortisation costs and all profits currently go back to thestate, which provides all investment capital in return.    This centralisation has hindered management's response tochanges in world markets vital for the East German economy,economists said. REUTER&#3;
