Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oiloutput on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouringColombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.    Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake whichdamaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields atLago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific.    About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.    Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before theearthquake.    The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon inColombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to thePacific ocean port of Temuco.    The government estimates it will take about four moremonths to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and returnoutput to normal levels, the spokesman said. REUTER&#3;
