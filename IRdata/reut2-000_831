Thailand's improving economy will likelycause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billiondlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion atend-February, private bankers said.    Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.    Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok BankLtd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relativelyhigh interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,contributed to the projected sharp rise.    Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected toexpand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.    A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand couldachieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, upfrom a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.    Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at itscurrent pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stablethe five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.    Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold,special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The targetis equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports. REUTER&#3;
