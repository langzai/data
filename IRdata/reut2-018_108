Leading Italian economists said theyregretted Paul Volcker's decision not to serve another term aschairman of the Federal Reserve Board.    Luigi Spaventa, Professor of Economics at Rome University,told Reuters he thought the decision was a great loss to theworld's financial markets.    "He (Volcker) was an element of reliability and stabilityaround world financial markets, a man of great experience,balance and equilibrium," Spaventa said.    Spaventa said it was difficult to gauge immediately whatVolcker's decision might mean for the dollar, but he noted thatthe markets seemed to like Volcker.     Mario Monti, Director of the Institute of Economics atMilan's Bocconi University, told Reuters that "whoever succeedsVolcker would face a formidable task because no central bankerhas ever given such credibility to monetary policy and fightinginflation."    Monti said Alan Greenspan, who has been nominated to takeover from Volcker, was likely to pursue "a rigorous monetarypolicy to demonstrate to the markets that there will be no lossof credibility."    Officials at the Bank of Italy and the Italian Treasury hadno comment on Volcker's decision. REUTER&#3;
