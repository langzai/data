Texaco Inc said it has fileda motion with the Texas Court of Appeals to supplement thecourt record with new evidence it has just received of allegedbias by Judge Anthony J.P. Farris against Texaco and its chieftrial lawyer in its litigation with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    The company contended that the alleged bias provides cleargrounds for a new trial. It said the motion was filed inconnection with its appeal of the Pennzoil judgment pending inthat court.    Texaco said the motion introduces two letters written byFarris, who has since died, to two Houston lawyers in late1984, after he had been assigned the case but before the trialbegan.    The company alleged that Farris harbored personal animosityagainst Texaco and its chief trial lawyer, Richard B. Miller,due to an earlier motion to have Farris disqualified from thecase. The motion was filed due to Farris' acceptance of a10,000 dlr campaign contribution from Pennzoil's chief triallawyer, Joseph P. Jamail, shortly after the case was assignedto him, Texaco said.    In February the Texas Appellate Court refused to grantTexaco a new trial, finding no evidence that Farris was biased.    Texaco said it is preparing its application for a rehearingon the merits of its case before the Texas Appelate Court, andthe application will be filed on March 30.    The company said it will ask the court to reconsider itsdecision on the issue of due process in light of the Farrisletters.    In the suit, Pennzoil has been awarded about 10.53 billiondlrs in damages from Texaco in connection with Pennzoil'sproposed merger with Getty Oil Co, which was later taken overby Texaco. Texaco is appealing the ruling.    A Texaco spokeswoman said the company had known of theletters for some time but were unable to release them until nowdue to understandings of confidentiality with the attorneysfrom which they were secured.
