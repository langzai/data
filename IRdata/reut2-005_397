The chairmen of the House and SenateBudget Committees are in general accord on the need to cut thefederal budget deficit by about 36 billion dlrs, half throughnew revenues, congressional sources said.    The sources told Reuters Senate Budget Committee ChairmanLawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, believes that it would benecessary to raise "at least" 18 billion dlrs in higherrevenues--the same being proposed by House Budget CommitteeChairman William Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat.    The Senate committee will hold its first drafting sessionon a budget tomorrow, the House group later in the week.    Both sides want to meet a congressional target of April 15for congressional approval of a new budget. However, theCongressional Budget Office said that a deficit cut of 36billion dlrs will fail to reach the Gramm-Rudman budget lawgoal of a 108 billion dlr deficit and would fall 27 billiondlrs short.     President Reagan's budget, not accepted by eithercommittee, proposed about 36 billion dlrs in deficitreductions--including some 22 billion dlrs in new revenuesthrough asset sales and excise fees--off of an estimateddeficit base of 144 billion dlrs.    Reagan said his budget hits the Gramm-Rudman goal for 1988but the Congressional Budget Office said it is way off the markwith over optimistic economic assumptions.    Currently, there are discussions underway by House andSenate committees to redefine the fixed Gramm-Rudman targetsfor more realistic levels that can be reached, which would pushoff by a year or two the 1991 goal for a balanced budget,sources said.
