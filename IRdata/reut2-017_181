Brazil's trade surplus in Marchtotalled only 136 mln dlrs compared to 1.13 billion dlrs in thesame month last year, director of the Banco do Brasil's ForeignTrade Department (Cacex) Roberto Fendt said.    In a news conference, Fendt attributed the weak performancein the March trade balance to labour strikes in the country.March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53 billiondlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March1986.    Fendt said that coffee earnings rose to 220 mln dlrs inMarch from 110 mln dlrs in February while oil derivatives weredown to 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.    He said that although the March results were considerablylower than the same month last year, the government's target ofan eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. TheJanuary-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, well below asimilar period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.    Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt saidthey were estimating that in each of the last six months of theyear the trade surplus would amount one billion dlrs. Reuter&#3;
