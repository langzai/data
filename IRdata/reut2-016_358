Bache Securities Inc, 80 pct-owned byPrudential-Bache Securities Inc, a unit of Prudential InsuranceCo of America, said it would change its name on April 15 toPrudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd as the first part of amajor expansion in Canada.    The investment dealer said the expansion would involveincreased research and retail staff, three new Canadianbranches by year-end and enhanced corporate financing ability.    Bache chief executive George McGough told a news conferencethat Bache might expand its 20 mln Canadian dlr capital base byup to seven times over the next several years.    McGough said the move resulted from the proposed June 30deregulation of Ontario's securities industry, which will liftexisting restrictions on the growth of foreign dealers such asBache and allow it access to its U.S. parent's 134 billion U.S.dlrs of capital and products offered by Prudential Insurance Coof Canada, also owned by Bache's U.S. parent.    Stressing that company growth would be internal, McGoughtold reporters "that our game plan does not call for anacquisition," saying Bache recently rejected merger overturesfrom three other investment dealers in Canada.    McGough declined to identify the names of the three dealersthat approached Bache.    He said that Bache hoped to rank in the top five Canadianinvestment dealers within the next few years. It now ranksabout 14th.    McGough voiced confidence that Bache's plans would beunaffected by any delay past June 30 in the implementation offinancial deregulation resulting from an ongoing disputebetween the Canadian and Ontario governments over regulatoryjusisdiction. He said regulators had already approved the namechange and indicated they would approve Bache's expansion. Reuter&#3;
