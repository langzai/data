The United States said a new attackby Iran in the Gulf war against Iraq does not appear to be amajor offensive.    "We don't believe that what has been called Karbala-8 is amajor offensive," State Department spokesman Charles Redmansaid.    He was responding to Iran's announcement that it hadlaunched its second offensive in three days against Iraq.    Karbala-8 is the code name for the attack in which bothsides have reported heavy fighting on the southern front nearthe major Iraqi port of Basra.    Redman said the offensive "appears to have been an Iranattack which has not made much of an advance."    Detailed information is lacking, he said, "but this seemsto be largely a repetition of the kind of fighting we had seenpreviously in the same area east of Basra."    Redman restated the U.S. call for an immediate end tohostilities and said Washington "deplored the loss of life inthis tragic war." Reuter&#3;
