The former chief currencydealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreignexchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,can stand trial for damages, a court ruled.    The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a casefor damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.    Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mlnmarks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.    The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of overone billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,and led to a tightening of banking regulations.    The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marksannounced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud incurrency transactions.    Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when itcollapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bankwere jailed in 1983.    But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he producedmedical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution duringhis childhood, which might have led him to take his own life. Reuter&#3;
