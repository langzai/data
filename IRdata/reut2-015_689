Reducing the amount of crop base afarmer can receive deficiency payments on is being looked at asone way to cut the U.S. agriculture budget for fiscal year1988, congressional aides and lobbyists said.    Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) has suggested that theplanted crop base a producer receives deficiency payments on bereduced by five pct, an aide to Stenholm said.    The aide said no official proposal has yet been drawn up,but that as it becomes more clear exactly how much agriculturespending will have to reduced, specific numbers will bediscussed and a proposal could "very likely" be drafted.    Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreagebase and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he wouldreceive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.    Current regulations provide farmers with deficiencypayments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.    Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 cropprograms in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.    Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officiallyoffered, it would likely be an amendment to the budgetreconciliation bill.    Other options currently being talked about as a way to cutone to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasingacreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments,implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting theuse of generic in-kind certificates.
