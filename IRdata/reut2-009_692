Bank Negara also said in its annual report that grossnational product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct,after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.    It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since lastNovember had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil andcommodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.    Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipatedrise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustaintheir average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.    Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil willaverage 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palmoil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a riseof 12 pct in manufacturing exports.

The resource gap in the government's financeson current account will be bridged over the near term," BankGovernor Jaafar Hussein said in the report.    The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year.
