Representatives of the InternationalWrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers havetold the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of itsforward strategy would lead to a better understanding betweenindustry and the LME.    In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meetingbetween the copper industry and the LME to discuss the newclearing house system, industry expressed grave concern aboutlatest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cashcleared market to replace the planned clearing system whichwill retain the prompt date settlement basis.    Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change(the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamentalchange in the function of the LME and in its service to theindustry, the release said.    By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging andphysical needs it would remove many of the unique advantagescurrently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable fromnon-trade orientated markets such as Comex.    The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience shouldtake a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industrydelegates said.    The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that nochange would be made to the clearing system planned to start onMay 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be givenin due course to the cash clearing proposal, made byAmalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.    A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assuranceof permanence in the new clearing system would remove industryfears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process ofreview and change, the press release said.
