A top Swiss banker called for anobligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds andsaid he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a companyshould be made to declare their share.    In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG>,chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.    A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swissfranc market and a debate on the use of registered shares toprevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.    Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to themarket with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which werereadily available to professionals through specialisedinformation systems.    "We should make this classification obligatory and publishit in places that are easily accessible to lay people," he said.The quick changing nature of the financial market meant theseratings should also be continually updated, he said.    Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered sharesand participation certificates rather than bearer shares.    However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. Therecent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> to take over HeroConserven Lenzburg &lt;HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someonewho was not eligible according to the company's statutes.    Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do notcarry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle ofgreater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.    "People buying, for example, more than five pct of acompany's shares should be made to declare their purchase," hesaid. REUTER&#3;
