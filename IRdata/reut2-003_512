Foreign Secretary Joe Clark urgedthe United States to take firm action on reducing "acid rain" andon sticking with the strict interpretation of theAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty but said he won no promises.    After a day of meetings with Vice President George Bush,Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige, Clark told a press conference he was persuaded theReagan adminstration had begun to deal seriously with Canadaand its concerns.    But he admitted he had won no assurances Washington wouldgo along with his government's position on several keycontroversial issues.    "There's a lot more attention to Canadian files. Whatremains to be seen is how much progress will be achieved," hetold reporters.    The meetings, which end today with talks on Capitol Hill,are part of a routine U.S.-Canadian consultation but are alsoexpected to lay groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next monthbetween President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.    Clark discouraged speculation that lack of a firm Americancommittment on the thorny issue of acid rain could render thesummit a failure.    Canada is seeking evidence that Reagan is prepared to liveup to a commitment made last year to implement in the UnitedStates a five-year five billion dlr U.S. program to testcleaner ways of burning coal.    "We expect the U.S. government to honor its commitment" anddiscussed this with Shultz today, Clark said.    "There's no question the matter is under serious detailedconsideration at the highest levels of the U.S. government," hesaid, adding that Shultz "left my meeting today to attend a(White House) cabinet meeting that was discussing this as wellas other questions."    "We will wait and see the results of that examination," hesaid.    Clark also said he reiterated Canada's position that theUnited States should adhere to a strict interpretation of the1972 ABM treaty, the only remaining operative arms controlagreement. Reuter&#3;
