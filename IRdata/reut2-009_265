British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherdenied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that hergovernment's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oilprices.    She said the government was determined not to intervene toinfluence production decisions by oil companies operating inthe North Sea.    "We believe these must be a matter for the commercialjudgment of the oil companies," she told the Arabic languagedaily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visitto London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.    Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fallin oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same asin 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.    British production was on a plateau and was unlikely toincrease in the future, she said.    "We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and otherOPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatilityfor both producer and consumer countries," Thatcher said.    "On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions whichmight add to such volatility." REUTER&#3;
