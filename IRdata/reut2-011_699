Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> managementboard chairman Walter Seipp said he hoped the bank would thisyear found a 100 pct investment bank subsidiary in New York.    He told the annual news conference that the move would bean important and necessary widening of business activities inthe U.S.. This is now mainly represented by a 40 pct stake inEuroPartners Securities Corp, New York, owned along with otherEuropean banks in a consortium.    It would also be a further step in Commerzbank's full entryinto global investment banking around the clock.    Seipp also said securities trading activities had beenconsiderably strengthened in London. The founding of CommerzSecurities (Japan) Co. Ltd, which would begin business in thefirst half of 1987, widened the bank's activity in Tokyo.    In 1987 also, Commerzbank planned to open a representativeoffice in Istanbul. Currency trading had begun in the LosAngeles branch, he added.    At home, Commerzbank would probably bring the automotivesupply group Boge and clothing manufacturer Ahlers to a stockexchange flotation in the first half of this year.    But the placement of shares in the print communicationstechnology group &lt;Linotype GmbH>, to be bought from AlliedSignal Inc &lt;ALD.N> would likely come later since several partsof the business had to be consolidated first.    Seipp said the purchase price had been "several hundredmillion dollars." But he gave no further details. Reuter&#3;
