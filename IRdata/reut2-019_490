Top-level talks last week between theEuropean Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolvea dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions nextmonth, diplomatic sources said.    The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as anunambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT anddismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italytaking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.    The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidiesof around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week'stalks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.    U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy hasreturned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadlinefor agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved arelated dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.    The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could bereopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It wasalso possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on ECpasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.    But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for afew days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and FransAndriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10. REUTER&#3;
