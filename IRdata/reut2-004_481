&lt;Casey-Werner Co>, producer of "TheCosby Show," said it filed suit against Viacom InternationalInc, seeking assurances that it will receive its share ofrevenues from the show's syndication.    It said the debt burden placed on Viacom by the 3.4 billiondlr buyout proposal from &lt;National Amusements Inc> and Viacom's9.9 mln dlr 1986 loss may prevent it from paying Casey-Wernerits money due from the show.    Casey-Werner sought assurances from Viacom that its shareof the syndication will not go to Viacom's creditors. But itsaid Viacom declined to provide the assurance.    Alvin Schulman, an attorney representing Casey-Werner, saidViacom should receive about 450 mln dlrs total from thesyndication rights to the show. Casey-Werner is entitled toabout 66 pct of the funds, he said.    Schulman added that Viacom is due to receive in March andApril an initial 40 mln dlrs from the syndication rights. Toensure Casey-Werner receives its share, the company filed suit,he said.    The suit asked the court to place all funds dueCasey-Werner in a trust, and for Viacom to account for allfunds received.
