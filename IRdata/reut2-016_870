The Japanese Embassy said in astatement it was "deeply disappointed" by the tariffs announcedby President Reagan in retaliation for Japan's not honoring itssemiconductor agreement with the United States.    It said Japan had been fully implementing the pact to enddumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its homemarket to U.S. goods and the results were starting to show.    The embassy said Japan would complain to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, as it said it would, and seeknew talks with Washington to resolve the issue as soon aspossible. Reuter&#3;
