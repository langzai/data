Noranda Inc said productionwill remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper mine hereuntil it can completely examine the mine.    If it decides to keep the mine open it would take four orfive months before it could resume full production.    Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation couldtake from a few days to several weeks but would not be morespecific.    Noranda said when it resumes production it plans to operatethe mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 tonnes annualfinished capacity.    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself outlate yesterday weakened part of the mine's support structure,Coffin said.    One miner was killed and 56 others were trapped undergroundfor about 24 hours before being brought safely out. Reuter&#3;
