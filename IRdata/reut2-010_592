Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumitasaid the central bank will carefully consider its monetarypolicy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar.    Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut inits discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have tocarefully consider its future money policy.    He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament thatcredit conditions have been eased by the five discount ratecuts by Japan since the beginning of last year.    Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up ininflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said.    Sumita said the central bank would continue to make ajudgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices,exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both inand outside Japan.    Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failurebecause the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he stillthought the pact was a good one in the sense that it hadcorrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accorddid not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.    The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief thatthe trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.
