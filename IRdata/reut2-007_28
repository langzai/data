Brisk increases in personal income andconsumption are to appear in February data released today, butthe bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be nomajor price reaction unless the rises are much larger thanexpected, economists said.    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,compared with no change in January, while consumptionexpenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.    M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also bereleased. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.        Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Incexpects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wageand salary disbursements in February.    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, theaverage workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose byfour cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durablegoods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of atleast 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bondmarket much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slippingjust 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrowrange, desperately seeking direction.    "Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bondmarket," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities CoInternational Inc.    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said thesteadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite somesigns of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectationsthat inflation will remain subdued.    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.    "It took the bond market a long while to see that inflationwas not returning to double digits, and now that it has learnedthat lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to fivepct inflation is a real possibility ahead," Boltz said in areport.    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds wereindicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct. Reuter&#3;
