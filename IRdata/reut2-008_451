A.H. Robins Co said it filed amotion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond seeking to establish an orderly procedure to determine the number of validDalkon Shield claims that must be dealt with in the company'sChapter 11 case.    The order would prescribe procedures for the filing anddisposition of objections to certain claims, it said.    Robins said that 200,000 of the 327,000 claims it hasreceived should be disallowed.    Robins said the claims are invalid because they areduplicates, the claimant is claiming injury from a productother than the Dalkon shield, claimants did not completecourt-required questionnaires by June 30, 1986, or the claimswere made beyond the April 30, 1986 deadline.    Robins has sought bankruptcy protection since August 1985following a flood of lawsuits relating to its intrauterineDalkon Shield, alleged to have caused uterine perforations,sterility, spontaneous abortions and death.     About 3.3 mln of the shields were sold in over 80countries between 1971 and 1974, including 2.2 mln in the U.S.before it was withdrawn from the market.    A spokesman said Robins has been told to withhold refilng areorganization plan pending the determination by acourt-appointed examiner whether other parties are interestedin acquiring Robins.    It had intended to file a plan in February, but received apurchase bid which was later withdrawn from American HomeProducts Corp.    American Home products never disclosed details of theproposed acquisition bid but analysts speculated that AmericanHome would provide about 1.5 billion dlrs for a separate trustfund to handle the liability claims.    Robins said that establishing a procedure for identifyinginvalid claims is vital to establishing a plan ofreorganization. Reuter&#3;
