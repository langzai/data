West German Farm Minister Ignaz Kiechle,who objected strongly to this week's European Communityagreement to cut milk surpluses, conceded the accord would havethe positive effect of stabilizing prices.    According to the text of a speech made in the town ofTrudering, near Munich, Kiechle said farmers' earnings wouldbenefit from more stable prices. He said he had rejected theagreement because he preferred there to be no change in theEC's system of intervention. However, an objective analysis ofthe accord showed it contained positive elements, he said.    No formal vote was taken on the EC accord, but a spokesmanfor the Agriculture Ministry in Bonn said Kiechle had made itclear in discussions in Brussels that he did not accept it.Ireland and Luxembourg were also opposed.
