European Community (EC)Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen said his proposal fora tax of up to 330 European Currency Units per tonne on oilsand fats was likely to go up for discussion at next week'ssummit meeting of EC leaders.    EC farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax, one ofthe main items proposed by Andriessen for the 1987-88 farmprice package.    The tax, which would apply on both domestically-producedand imported oils and fats, has been fiercely opposed by theUnited States and developing countries' vegetable and marineoil producers.
