"Agriculture has really become the number one internationaleconomic problem," Allen Wallis, undersecretary of state foreconomic affairs, told Reuters in an interview.    At the Tokyo economic summit last year, western leadersidentified agriculture as a major international problem butmade no specific recommendations.    This year, Wallis said the U.S. will press for a statementinstructing trade ministers to begin negotiating on the issue,and include domestic programs.    While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, willnot conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give apush to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT).    Wallis said the leaders should endorse a "comprehensive"negotiation, which is interpreted as including domesticpolicies as well as import restraints and export subsidies. Reuter&#3;
