Canada's Foreign Minister Joe Clarksaid there is greater international recognition on the need toreduce government-imposed subsidies on agricultural produce.    "There is now recognition that agricultural subsidies mustbe reduced, and other reform measures pursued," Clark told aconference of ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations)foreign ministers and their counterparts from sixindustrialised countries.    A delegate said Clark's call for "halting the subsidy war inthe agricultural products" to ensure a stable world tradingsystem received warm support from Japan and Australia.    Clark said the Organisation of Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) has called for "reduction of direct andindirect subsidies and avoidance of predatory or protectionisttrade practices."    The OECD stand was endorsed by the Venice economic summitthis month. However, he said he did not expect any quicksolution to the subsidy problem.    Clark said Canadian farmers, like those of ASEAN, "arecaught in the cross-fire of an agricultural subsidy war that isnot of our making."    Clark said his country will provide 10 mln Canadian dlrs asaid over thu next five years to developing countries of theSouth Pacific region to finance fisheries and other marineprojects.    "The new program, which we estimate will cost about two mlnCanadian dlrs a year, will be implemented by t&#127;e InternationalCentre for Ocean Development (ICOD) in close cooperation withthe major South Pacific regional organisations," he said.
