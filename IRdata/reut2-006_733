The Interstate Commerce Commission(ICC), which regulates interstate freight rail service,concluded that none of the 24 largest U.S. freight railroadshad adequate revenues in 1985.    The finding is important because it means the ICC is likelyto look favorably on requests for rate increases by theserailroads made during the current year.    Under federal law, the ICC must give harsher scrutiny torate increase requests for railroads with adequate revenues.    Though freight rates are no longer strictly regulated bythe government, the ICC can still block a newly proposed rateif it finds it to be unreasonable.    In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICChas been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industryand shippers. This year, the ICC used a new approach but two offive commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.    "For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returnshave fallen well short of their cost of capital, howeverdefined," commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who votedwith the majority.    The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with thehighest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake andOhio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3pct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and andthe Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.    Four of the 24 largest railroads--the Boston and Maine, theDelaware and Hudson, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern and theWestern Pacific--had operating losses, the ICC found. Reuter&#3;
