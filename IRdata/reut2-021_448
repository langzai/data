Uganda plans to export roasted coffee toEurope by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.    A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry ofIndustry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grindand pack local coffee for export. Construction will start inDecember and the factory should be ready by next October.    He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the CoffeeMarketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi alsotold reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loanfrom the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.    Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, andexpects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.    Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefitUganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln(60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under thelatest International Coffee Agreement.    In addition, the value of roasted coffee should besubstantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.    The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most ofwhich is used to produce instant coffee. REUTER&#3;
