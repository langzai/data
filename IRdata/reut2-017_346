Canadian gross domestic product shouldgrow at a real rate of 3.3 pct this year before easing to a 3.0pct growth rate next year when U.S. economic growth is expectedto decline, Royal Bank of Canada, Canada's largest bank, saidin its monthly economic forecast.    The forecast is from fourth quarter to fourth quarter. Thebank did not give Canada's real rate of growth for 1986. Thebank said it expects the Canadian dollar to remain at the 75U.S. ct level for the next few months as major economicfundamentals have not improved enough to return the currency toa higher level in the absence of a wider interest rate spread.
