CBT corn futures held gains of two to2-3/4 cents per bushel in moderately light midsession trade.    Yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly corn export figure toabout three times last year's weekly inspections, plus theoutlook for a continued active export pace due to the declinein the U.S. dollar this year, supported nearbys, traders said.    Diminished PIK-and-roll activity, compared with the activepace seen last week, added to the more positive tone.    Most dealers expect the contract lows in corn futures tohold, with some looking for the improving chart picture tosupport a further advance.    A local house, Cargill, the Illinois Co-op, Refco and ADMwere the featured buyers of old crop May, with Drexel/Burnham asteady buyer in new crop December, pit brokers said. Reuter&#3;
