The French aerospace industry had a mixedyear in 1986, with military sales hit by the falling dollar andlower oil and raw material prices but the civilian sectorperforming better, Jacques Benichou, president of the theFrench aeronautics and space industries group (GIFAS) said.    He told journalists here that the sales success of theEuropean Airbus Industrie consortium, in which France has a 38pct stake through Aerospatiale, and the SNECMA aero-enginegroup, which has a 50 pct stake in CFM International with theU.S. Group General Electric, had both performed well.    Turnover for the French aerospace industry was 74 billionfrancs last year, comparable in constant terms with 1985, whilethe trade surplus for the industry was around 30 billionfrancs.    "We should be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic,"Benichou said. Reuter&#3;
