Cominco Ltd said itwill permanently close its fertilizer plant at Kimberley,British Columbia, in the latter half of May and 140 employeeswill lose their jobs.    It said the operation has been losing money for severalyears, and lost seven mln dlrs in 1986.    Cominco said the decision to close the plant was based onhigh production costs, anticipated continued losses and excesscapacity for phosphate-based fertilizers. The plant produced98,500 metric tonnes of ammonium phosphate fertilizer and190,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid in 1986.                                           Reuter&#3;
