Dismantling agricultural subsidiesand implementing international farm policy reform will be thetop priorities of the United States at the upcoming VeniceEconomic Summit, Secretary of State George Shultz told a groupof American farm leaders.    "We want to see the American farmer put in a position inwhich he can compete on a level playing field," Shultz told theboard of directors for the National Association of WheatGrowers.    The global agricultural situation is in the midst of themost serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, andhow the U.S. responds to the current problems will determinewhether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in worldagriculture.    Government policies that subsidize production and exportshave created a "crisis of overproduction," he said. Shultzparticularly criticized European Community policies which hesaid encourage domestic production by providing high governmentsupports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product withthe help of huge subsidies.    The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continuecurrent high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannotstop subsidies alone, Shultz said. "We have to agree todismantle these systems together," he said.    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the leadin agricultural reform, he said. For that reason, U.S.officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting andhave made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva. Reuter&#3;
