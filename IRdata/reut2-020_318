The American Soybean Association (ASA)denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegalunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, andthreatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does notremedy the situation.    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsoredOutlook 87 conference: "It will be filed unless the EC takesdrastic and immediate steps."    "These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,since they were established after the zero soybean duty wasestablished in 1962," he said.    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would askfor an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies tomake the regime non-discriminatory.    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, inan effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds productionhas risen dramatically since then.    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above worldmarket levels and is considering implementing a controversialoils and fats tax.    The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zeroduty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adamssaid.    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support itstrade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes anEC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in theEC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct involume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result ofEC policies, Adams added.    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker atthe conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products. Reuter&#3;
