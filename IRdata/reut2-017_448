Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd&lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) and explorer &lt;City Resources Ltd> have agreed inprinciple on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvialgold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said.    City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct ofRGC's Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, byspending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement.    It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in thepast, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses intailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced atotal of 2.1 mln ounces.    City Resources also said previous dredging was only carriedout to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values arereported to at least 60 metres in the central part of theBulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.    In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolowas 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres ofgravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator.    The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the firstsuccessful gold mining operation of &lt;Placer Development Ltd>after it was floated in Canada in 1926.
