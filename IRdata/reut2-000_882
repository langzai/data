President Corazon Aquino announcedgovernment plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from thesale of failed businesses taken over by the government.    Aquino said she was willing to have her family's sugarestate broken up in compliance with Philippine land reformprogrammes but hinted it would not be offered voluntarily.    "Whatever laws will be enacted, I say that nobody is abovethe law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters areFilipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws areenacted as far as sugar land is concerned," she told reporters.    A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan,including the question of whether land operated bymultinational companies should also be covered, she added.    Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recentlythe government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of landto impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reformprogramme.    The plan, requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs, now also coverssugar and coconut areas, apart from rice and corn lands, hesaid. It was expected to benefit about three mln landlesspeasants, he added.    Land reform pressure groups have called on Aquino to breakup her family's 6,000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate hersincerity on the issue political analysts have called one ofthe most pressing problems facing the Philippines.    It was not known whether government would wait for theCongress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme orhave Aquino carry it out through an executive order.    Under the plan, government will purchase land mainly fromlandowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will includevacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50,000 hectaresseized from former associates of deposed president FerdinandMarcos. REUTER&#3;
