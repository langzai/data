Members of local 174 of the United Foodand Commercial Workers (UFCW) union, representing 1,900 meatcutters in New York city, yesterday rejected the latestmanagement offer on a new contract.    "Members rejected the latest offer by a 2 to 1 margin," BobWilson, executive officer of local 174 said. But workers havebeen asked to remain on the job while negotiations continue.    The union has been in negotiations with the Greater NewYork Association of Meat and Poultry Dealers, a group of meatwholesalers and distributors. The contract expired April 26 andthe latest management offer sought "give backs" in holiday andsick leave which the membership rejected, Wilson said. Reuter&#3;
