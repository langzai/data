Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone saidthat Japan and other industrialized nations committedthemselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above150 yen.    He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament thatthe six nations have taken measures, including marketintervention, to support the dollar above that level.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committeethat the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. AndWest Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollarfell below 150 yen.    Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilizeexchange rates.    Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals ofeach nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he didnot think the fundamentals themselves had changedsubstantially.    But he said the market is sensitively looking at what ishappening in major nations. He did not elaborate.    Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there hasbeen such speculative dollar selling in the market. REUTER&#3;
