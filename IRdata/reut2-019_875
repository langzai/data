Prospects appear slim for a summermeeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the twocountries enter the final year of their bilateral grainsagreement, Agriculture Department officials said.    The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of theagreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed upto last February. However, any delay this year should notendanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extendsthrough September, 1988, USDA officials said.    "It will be difficult to pull together the people for themeeting during July," an aide to USDA undersecretary DanielAmstutz said.    Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, thenext talks could still be a "couple more months," he said.       There has been grain industry speculation that the USDAwill offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the nextmarketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultationswere held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.    "I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summeror before the next agreement year begins," a USDA source said.    Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about nextyear's crops, he said, "There are too many variables now. Itwould be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now."    Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase aminimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet andU.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start ofa new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shippinglogistics and production outlooks. Reuter&#3;
