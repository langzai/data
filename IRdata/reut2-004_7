Canadian Foreign Secretary JoeClark, winding up a two-day visit to Washington, said heexpected the Reagan administration to take some action onreducing acid rain.    "My impression is there will be some movement by the UnitedStates administration on acid rain (but) how much movement Ican't judge or predict," he told reporters.    The meetings with American officials are part of a routineU.S.-Canada consultation but are also expected to lay thegroundwork for a summit in Ottawa next month between PresidentReagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.    Clark today held discussions with Treasury Secretary JamesBaker and Democratic Sens. Patrick Moynihan of New York,Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas andGeorge Mitchell of Maine.

Among its priorities, Canada is seeking evidence thatReagan is prepared to live up to a commitment made last year toimplement in the United States a five-year 5 billion U.S. dlrprogram to test cleaner ways of burning coal.    This issue was discussed at length with Baker and severalof the senators, including Mitchell who urged Canada to "keepthe heat on" the Reagan administration to force action, Canadianofficials said.    Also taken up with most of the senators and Baker weretrade issues, including the need for the United States andCanada to establish a better mechanism for settling tradedisputes between the two countries, who are each other's majortrading partner, Canadian officials said.
