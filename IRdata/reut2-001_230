The Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp is facing a deficit because of its potentialliability from insolvent savings associations, the GeneralAccounting Office told a House Banking hearing.    "We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billiondlrs to handle cases that will require action in the nearfuture," Frederick Wolf of the GAO said.    "When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves, FSLICwould have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the endof 1986. Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve thelarge backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associationsthat continue to operate," Wolf said.    He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department'splan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalizeFSLIC.    Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLICinsured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct wereinsolvent.    He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable,earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first threequarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associationslost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period.    The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress.    Roy Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank ofDallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eightbillion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 Texas savingsassociations and 14 associations in nearby states which he saidare considered "hopelessly insolvent".
