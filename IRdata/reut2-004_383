It could be months before majorassistance is provided for Earthquake-stricken Ecuador,although the International Monetary Fund and the developmentbanks have already taken the first steps, monetary sources andU.S. officials said.    They said the IMF had informed the Ecuadorean governmentthat it was prepared, under its emergency system, to provideabout 50 mln dlrs, or about 25 per cent of the country's quotain the agency, but it is up to Ecuador to request the money.    At the same time, the World Bank and the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank have dispatched missions to the region hit bylast Thursday's quake to determine what the country's needs areand how they can speed up disbursement of funds from programsalready approved.    The World Bank estimates that of the over one billion dlrsit has approved for Ecuador in recent years, some 277 mln dlrshas yet to be disbursed and a portion of this could,potentially, be made available.    The bank said that the programs it has approved are forrural development, agriculture, water and sewerage, electricalpower and others.    If the assistance that is needed can be fit into thesegeneral categories, the funds could be then provided for fromexpedited disbursements Reuter&#3;
