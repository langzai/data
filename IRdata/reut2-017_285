Saudi Arabia will not seek to push OPECoil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrelunless oil demand grows strongly, the Middle East EconomicSurvey (MEES) said.    The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritativeSaudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy wouldnot change "unless and until there is a strong revival in thegrowth of demand for oil."    MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi pricehawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources.    The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on thelong-term need to restore the competitive position of oil ingeneral and OPEC oil in particular against other energysources.    "Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with itsOPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint tomaintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level," MEESsaid.    The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeksof April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mlnbarrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week,causing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said.    MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures forMarch and Reuter estimates for March.    It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd thismonth to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, withan OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this monthto two mln bpd, not including "war relief" supplies from Kuwaitand Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said.    Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mlnbpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added. REUTER&#3;
