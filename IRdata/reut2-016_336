Kuwait has agreed to charter tankersfrom the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exportsthrough the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said.    They said the agreement followed months of talks with theSoviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exportsafter Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels inretaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq.    Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initiallyto reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tankerfleet.    The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow toprovide a naval escort for its own vessels, but "the idea ofprotection is implicit," one said.    They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the pastto unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq wereknown to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Sovietships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats saidthey expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail betweenKuwait and Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coasta short way outside the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of theGulf.
