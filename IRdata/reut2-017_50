Ecuador will use a new pipeline linkwith Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.    The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built toallow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,    Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed itsOPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debtscontracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuadormines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.    The two ministers were speaking at a news conference aftersigning an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitationof the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drillingwill begin in September.    "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not onlyfor this emergency period but for the next five years, withpossibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrelsper day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said.    Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrelsthrough the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 centsper barrel during the first year.    The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, willrun from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungleoilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to thePacific port of Tumaco.    Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on theEcuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures forColombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant comparedwith what we are going to earn."    OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd beforethe quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mlndlrs per month, Espinosa said. REUTER&#3;
