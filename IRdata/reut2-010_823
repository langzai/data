The U.S. Senate has approved ameasure that would allow an estimated 4,200 agricultural banksto write off loan losses over 10 years.    The measure, offered by Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), wasattached to a bill to recapitalize the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp that the Senate approved March 27.    Dixon's amendment would permit agricultural banks -- bankswith assets of 100 mln dlrs or less and at least 25 pct oftotal loans in farm loans -- to write down over 10 yearsagricultural loan losses incurred between 1984 and 1992.    Dixon said current law, which requires losses to bededucted immediately from bank capital, "forces banks to try notto acknowledge the extent of their problems."    Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) said farm banks have beenconcerned that write-downs might reduce their capitalizationbelow the six pct regulatory requirement.    Last year Congress urged federal regulators to useforbearance in the assessment of agricultural loans. However,Kassebaum said "only a miniscule number of banks" have qualifiedfor the capital forbearance provisions.    Dixon's measure also would allow agricultural banks toamortize losses on the reduced value of farmland acquired inthe handling of agricultural loans. Reuter&#3;
