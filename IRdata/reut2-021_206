The Senate Agriculture Committee wasexpected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments incounty loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn andwheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan ratedifferentials to no more than one pct per year from thenational average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary toincrease the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by"an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected cornstocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat setaside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels. Reuter&#3;
