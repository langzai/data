Japanese oil traders and refiners areconsidering whether to suspend further business with Texaco Inc&lt;TX>, which yesterday filed for protection under Chapter 11 ofthe U.S. Bankruptcy code, industry sources told Reuters.    Texaco, the third biggest U.S. Oil company, said it filedto protect itself from creditors while it fights a legal battlewith Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over the purchase of Getty PetroleumCorp &lt;GTY> in 1984.    Many Japanese trading houses decided to stop dealing withTexaco several months ago as rumours it was about to file forbankruptcy spread through the market, the sources said.    "We haven't dealt with them for six months," said oneJapanese trader.    Some Japanese trading houses with offices in the U.S. Mayask for letters of credit if they decide to continue tradingwith Texaco, oil sources said.    They said Texaco, which said its bankrupcty protectionmeasure will not affect the majority of its businesses, mayfind industry reaction stronger than anticipated.    "Texaco tried to buy substantial volumes of gasoline on theU.S. Gulf on Friday but no one offered to them," one tradinghouse source said.    One U.S. Major is reviewing its relationship with Texaco,and an international oil trading company, while continuinglimited transactions with Texaco, will send its lawyers to meetwith the company tonight in New York, oil sources said.    But one Japanese oil company, which holds several jointventure oil exploration interests with Texaco, said businesswould continue as usual pending the outcome of the dispute, acompany spokesman said.
