Senior Belgian cabinet ministersreached an agreement on budgetary economies, which will allowthe net budgetary financing requirement to remain withinpreviously set limits, the government said in a statement.    The statement, issued as ministers ended a marathon meetingin the early hours of this morning, did not give furtherdetails.    However, Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt said before themeeting he was seeking economies of at least 21.2 billionfrancs in order to keep the financing requirement at 418billion francs this year, or eight pct of Gross NationalProduct.    The government set this figure as its target for thefinancing requirement last year when it announced a program ofcuts designed to reduce spending by 195 billion francs in 1987.    However, Verhofstadt had claimed that subsequentdevelopments had meant that unless further cuts were found, thefinancing requirement would be considerably higher.    Last year, Belgium had a financing requirement of 561billion francs, or 11.0 pct of GNP.    A government spokeswoman said the accord would beconsidered by the full cabinet later today, and Prime MinisterWilfried Martens would announce it to Parliament on Monday.    She said no details would be made public before then. REUTER&#3;
