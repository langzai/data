The Kansas City Board of Trade,KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposalto raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculativeposition limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the planwould put the the Kansas exchange "at a serious competitivedisadvantage."    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last monthproposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.    At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheatspeculative position limits unchanged.    "Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat wouldsignificantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBTfor speculative interest," Michael Braude, president of theKansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.    A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account openinterest affected by existing speculative limits in proposingto raise CBT's limits.    KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedgingefficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and ofthe exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability toattract large speculators.    The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend itsproposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact samebushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.    CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal untilJune 3. Reuter&#3;
