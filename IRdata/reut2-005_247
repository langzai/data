Radioactive contamination of watersupplies around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant will notreach danger levels when the winter snowfall starts to melt, aSoviet scientist was quoted as saying at the weekend.    Konstantin Sytnik, vice-president of the Ukrainian Academyof Sciences, said there had been fears that melted snowcontaining radioactive particles might flow into main watersupplies.    But he told the Communist Party newspaper Pravda thatcontamination of snow around the plant was within safety levelsand some of it had already been absorbed into the soil.    Snowfall this winter had been greater than usual and acertain increase in the amount of radiation in the water wasinevitable. But contamination would be within the permissiblelimits, Sytnik said.    The banks of the river Pripyat, which flows near the plant,had been reinforced to prevent it bursting its banks when thethaw began this spring, he added.    About 135,000 people were evacuated and 31 were killedafter an explosion and fire at Chernobyl last April 26. Aconcrete wall was built last summer to prevent contamination ofthe Pripyat by radioactive ground water.    Meanwhile, a Ukrainian official was quoted as saying todaythat preparations were under way in the Ukraine to evacuatetowns and villages before there was heavy flooding after higherthan usual snowfall this winter.    V. Martynenko, head of a flood commission in the Donbassarea of the Ukraine, told Pravda preparations had begun for theevacuation of about 112,000 people in the Donbass in the southof the republic. About 190 towns and villages and 12,000 homescould be flooded when snow -- falls of which had been six timeshigher than usual in some areas -- started to thaw. Cattle hadalready been moved from some parts, they said. REUTER&#3;
