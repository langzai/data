Good soaking rain is boosting the sugarcane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following aprolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, anAustralian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters.    The rains began late last week, developed into heavydownpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he saidfrom Brisbane.    The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow abouthalf the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland caneareas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December.    The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, justto the north of the Mackay region on the central Queenslandcoastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshenedthe crop there.    Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas,the overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturnof 3.37 mln tonnes, he said.    But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely acouple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin cropswere going to suffer badly, he said.    Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be availableearly next month, the spokesman said.    The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start laterthis year, in late June or early July against mid-June lastyear, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said.    The crush normally runs to around the end of December.    Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, withsome mill areas expecting record crops, he said.    Industry records show variations in the crop are not alwaysmirrored in raws output. In 1985, 24.4 mln tonnes of sweetercane than in 1986 produced 3.38 mln tonnes of raws. REUTER&#3;
