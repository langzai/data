Texaco Inc said it has fileda motion with the Texas Court of Appeals in Houston seeking arehearing of the court's decision to uphold most of PennzoilCo's 11.12 billion dlr judgment against Texaco.    The company said its motion cites over 200 errors containedin the February 12 appeals court decision, adding its "briefsimply 'rubberstamps' the original trial court judgment whichthe company has said 'riddled with errors'."    In support of its argument, Texaco's motion emphasized arecent case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the SeventhCircuit in Chicago in Skycom Corp v. Telstar Corp as"unequivocal confirmation that the Texas Court's opinion iswrong," according to Gibson Gayle, a Texaco attorney with theHouston firm of Fulbright and Jaworski.    "The United States Court of Appeals in Chicago issued theruling based on facts strikingly similar to the facts in theTexaco-Pennzoil litigation," he said.    "The question before the (federal appeals) court waswhether an "agreement in principle' subject to execution of'formal documents' is a contract according to New York law.    "The answer by the court was a resounding 'No' -- preciselyopposite the answer given by the Appellate Court in Texas,"Gayle said.    "The United States Court of appeals reached this decisionfor the identical reasons that Texas and the Attorney Generalof New York have cited in their briefs before the Texasappellate court," he pointed out.    "Texaco has consistently maintained that Pennzoil did nothave a binding contract to Buy Getty Oil shares, since a pressrelease announced only an 'agreement in principle' which was'subject to the execution of a definitive merger agreement',"according to Gayle.
