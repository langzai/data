The Reagan administration is debatingwhether to provide government credit guarantees for the exportof plywood, a U.S. Agriculture Department official said.    As a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperationand Development, OECD, the United States has agreed not toprovide any concessional credits on the export of manufacturedproducts.    However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims toldReuters the administration is considering allowing USDA toprovide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on thegrounds it is not a manufactured product.    Sims said it was clear that wood products such asfurniture, tables and window frames would be consideredmanufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export creditguarantees. However, the case of plywood was less clear.    "As long as it's a basic material, we consider it still justa processed version of the basic agricultural commodity," Simssaid in a telephone interview.    Earlier today, USDA said that plywood was eligible under anexport credit guarantee offer for Turkey announced yesterday.In its original announcement yesterday, USDA had said the offerincluded three mln dlrs for the export of lumber, excludingplywood. However, Sims said he did not expect any plywoodexports to be including under the lumber guarantee offer. Reuter&#3;
