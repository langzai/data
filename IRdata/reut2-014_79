The company said U.S. cement consumption totaled 90.6 mlntons last year, up four pct from 1985.    Lone Star also said it expects consolidation andinternationalization of the U.S. cement industry to continue,adding foreign companies now own over 50 pct of U.S. capacity.    Since 1974, it added, more  than 30 cement plants haveclosed. "In our opinion, the industry's annual cement capacitytoday is, in reality, less than 80 mln tons" a year, it added.    Lone Star said the gap between supply and demand is beingfilled by imported cement, which accounted for 18 pct ofdomestic consumption last year, up from four pct ten years ago. Reuter&#3;
