U.S. District Court Judge EugeneA. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow onBurlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stopSamjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.    Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case couldbe pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeoverbattle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.    Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyersfor Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by DominionTextile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.    Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminaryinjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer untilthe case is decided.    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlrbuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per sharelower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjenslast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjensoffer.    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman andDominion used illegally obtained confidential information aboutthe company in making their takeover attempt.     That information, Burlington said, was provided by JamesAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebberGroup Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington'ssales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never todivulge inside information about the company.    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he beganworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace itsmanagement," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information fromPaineWebber, but argued the information was public informationand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts orBurlington's public financial statements.    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met withEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet withthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion wentpublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board inFebruary.    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion helddiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting asfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke offbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman anddominion with a written statement that they did not provideinside information.    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeenwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairmanFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive andthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in aneffort to takeover Burlilgnton.    "The ultimate question is not the price per share or theprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct forthose who would takeover an American company," said burlingtonlawyer Humphrey.    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as thelargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be inviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada'slargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plantsin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,the lawyers said.    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said themarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contendsand that Burlington has the ability to switch between lightweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and pricedictate.    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed byBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bidfor Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goosewould have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher,a Samjens lawyer. Reuter&#3;
