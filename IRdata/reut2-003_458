A spokesman for PreussagAG &lt;PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the companywould pay a dividend on 1986 results    He was commenting on a Preussag statement which saidresults in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag hasfrequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986following a difficult year in 1985.    Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said inDecember the board would prefer to stick to its policy of notdipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted thefinal dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 comparedwith 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil andshipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends inthe group's other divisions.    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domesticgroup would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would dependpartly on the level of provisions.    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from ninemarks on 1984 results after parent company net profit droppedto 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marksin 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected byunsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as bypoor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarterof 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was anadditional factor behind the drop in results.    Preussag said rationalization measures already introducedwould not begin to take full effect until this year.    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billionmarks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the firsttime consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from itsmajority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alonewas 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparisonfigures.    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production roseto 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)subsidiary, whose results are included in the world groupaccounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter oflast year.    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by theinternational tin crisis, were the reason behind the worldgroup losses that year. REUTER&#3;
