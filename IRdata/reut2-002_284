Striking Brazilian seamen, who saythey have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports,today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour MinisterAlmir Pazzianotto, union officials said.    Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the NationalMerchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talkswould lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.    Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.    The union official said the strike had halted a total of158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, andabout 50 more in Rio de Janeiro.    Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain,Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.    Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern tothe government, which has already had to suspend interestpayments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drasticdeterioration in the country's trade balance.    The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, MuriloRubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantilnewspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign shipscould be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.    "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it isnot conceivable that exports be hit," he said.    "But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we aregoing to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad,and all this through the fault of the seamen," Rubens Habbemasaid.    A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been thescene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, saidmovement of ships out of the port was running at about half itsnormal level of 12 ships a day.    He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchoron moored in the harbour. Reuter&#3;
