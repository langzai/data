U.S. Agriculture undersecretary DanAmstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with theSoviet Union about the competitiveness of U.S. wheat prices butwould not discuss making U.S. wheat prices "cheap."    "There sometimes is a difference between being competitiveand being cheap," Amstutz told a Senate AgricultureAppropriations hearing.    Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow andWashington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offeredon wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheatprice was competitive or cheap.    "I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore thisissue as it pertains to competitiveness," Amstutz said.    However, Amstutz added that the United States would not bewilling to discuss wheat prices with Moscow "if the issue isbeing cheap."    Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinctionbetween competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate.    Amstutz said it is the U.S. judgment that the long-termgrain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow tobuy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at"prices in effect in this country."    Amstutz made the comments in response to a question fromSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, about expanding the exportenhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union. Reuter&#3;
