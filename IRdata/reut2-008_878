Calumet Industries Inc said it expectsto report a loss from operations for its second quarter endingMarch 31, despite a strong unit sales increase.    In the same year-ago period the company reported net incomeof 366,953 dlrs, or 18 cts a share.    Chairman S. Mark Salvino said the expected loss isprimarily due to depressed product prices not recovering theincreasing cost of crude oil.    Salvino also said steadier crude prices and the reducedrate of refinery production should increase product prices andlead to a return to more normal profit margins.    He reported that the 23 mln dlr HydroCal II system underconstruction at the company's refinery in Princeton, La., is onschedule and production will begin early in fiscal 1988. Reuter&#3;
