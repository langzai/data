The U.K. High Court dismissed an appealby Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unitand ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for thefuture cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,the Press Association reported.    The company was appealing against a decision of the TaxCommissioners that any such provision was a capitalexpenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.The court was told that since 1976 the company had made anannual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost ofabandoning a rig.    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as thesubsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductiblefrom corporation tax payable.    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but allbudgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, hesaid.    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability wasshared by the industry as a whole.    The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on theexpensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when theexpense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses werebuilt into the accounts, one analyst added.
