The Farmers Home Administration, theU.S. Agriculture Department's farm lending arm, could loseabout seven billion dlrs in outstanding principal on itsseverely delinquent borrowers, or about one-fourth of its farmloan portfolio, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.    In remarks prepared for delivery to the Senate AgricultureCommittee, Brian Crowley, senior associate director of GAO,also said that a preliminary analysis of proposed changes inFmHA's financial eligibility standards indicated as many as onehalf of FmHA borrowers who received new loans from the agencyin 1986 would be ineligible under the proposed system.    The agency has proposed evaluating applicants' credit usinga variety of financial ratios instead of relying solely oncashflow ability.    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)slammed the proposed eligibility changes, telling FmHAAdministrator Vance Clark at a hearing that they would mark a"dramatic shift" in the agency's purpose away from being farmers'lender of last resort toward becoming a "big city bank."    But Clark defended the new regulations, saying the agencyhad a responsibility to administer its 70-billion dlr loanportfolio in a "compassionate yet judicious manner."    Crowley of GAO, Congress' investigative arm, said theproposed credit scoring system attempted to ensure that FmHAwould make loans only to borrowers who had a reasonable changeof repaying their debt.
