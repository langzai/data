West German feedstuffs production isexpected to decline further after it dropped to 16.5 mln tonnesin 1986 from 16.7 mln the previous year, the West German FeedStuff Industry Association (MFI) said.    Association president Ulrich Wagner told a news conferenceWest Germany's rate of self sufficiency in the feedstuffssector is expected to fall below 70 pct this year from around75 pct in 1986.    He attributed the expected decline to introduction of milkquotas in 1984, aimed at curbing EC milk production, and tocheaper imports from abroad.    "Our industry's output is not even close to stagnation,"Wagner said. "In the long term we expect annual production todecline steadily."    The only sector which saw a slight increase last year, by0.6 pct, was feed for poultry which rose to 3.25 mln tonnesfrom 3.23 mln, he said.    Wagner predicted that the sales volume in feed for dairycattle will decline even more this year because of the furthercut in milk output from April. Reuter&#3;
