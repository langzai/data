Regulations governing hedging and riskmanagement should be revised and development of new futuresinstruments cautiously monitored in dealing with the growth ofoff-exchange futures instruments, Robert Davis, a commissioneron the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, said.    Davis told the Chicago chapter of the Futures IndustryAssociation Commodity Research Division last night "there is nocause for undue alarm" in the growth of off-exchangeinstruments.    However, he said, the CFTC "must clarify jurisdictional andregulatory issues" by maintaining the safeguards intended bycommodity regulations while encouraging "the furtherdevelopment of competitive markets."    "There is not a single off-exchange issue, there cannot beone policy approach, and to the extent that problems exist,there cannot be one solution," Davis said.    The development of off-exchange instruments with futurescontract characteristics has become of increasing concern tofederal regulators who are trying to define what issues arecovered under existing regulations and where new regulationsare needed to protect private investment.    Davis said the CFTC should step up enforcement whereoff-exchange instruments are intended to compete withexchange-traded issues, correct "regulatory inflexibility"which may force new instruments off exchange, and "delineateand separate those harmful off-exchange developments from themany that are not."    "We cannot ignore that some of the growth of off-exchangetrading represents a desirable further development of financialforward contracts that complement, rather than compete with,the relatively new financial futures contracts," Davis said.    He said a CFTC task force is continuing its investigationof the off-exchange issue. Reuter&#3;
