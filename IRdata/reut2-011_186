Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc&lt;CAWL.L> firmed in morning trading on market speculation thatits participation in a joint telecommunications venture inJapan would not be curtailed, dealers said.    The company's shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMTcompared with 364p last night.    The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate inJapan. Cable has said it is resisting attempts by theFederation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-basedtelecommunications firms, a move which would have cut Cable'sstake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit.    However, the dealers were uncertain exactly how the disputeover the shareholdings had been resolved.    British prime minister MargaretThatcher said in parliamentlast week that she regarded Cable and Wireless's participationin the Japanese venture as a test case of how open the Japanesetelecommunications market really was.    A spokesman for Cable said he was unaware if thespeculation had any foundation. Cable itself had issued nostatement today on the issue. REUTER&#3;
