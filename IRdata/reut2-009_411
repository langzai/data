International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phaseof negotiations, delegates said, but they remained confidentabout prospects for reaching agreement by Friday.    Cocoa producers, European Community (EC) consumers and allconsumers separately reviewed technical details of a bufferstock rules package distributed yesterday.    The buffer stock working group of consumers and producerswas set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly forthe first time, they said.    Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be theamount of non-member cocoa allowed to be bought for the bufferstock, and the fixed price differentials at which differentorigin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager.    Producers would prefer that non-member cocoa not beincluded in the buffer stock because, if it is, countries suchas Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joiningit, the delegates said.
