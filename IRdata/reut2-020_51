The outlook for Mexico's economy andstockmarket remains optimistic despite the market's worst-everfall of 52,671.56 points on Monday, the president of theMexican stock exchange, Manuel Somoza, said.    He said the 16.51 pct drop in the exchange's indexreflected a "totally emotional" reaction to Monday's fall on theNew York stock exchange and was not a reflection of a newcrisis for the Mexican economy or the stockmarket."    He was speaking at a news conference here on Monday.    "We think that after the psycological effect the market willtend to stabilize itself," Somoza said.    Somoza said he based his optimism on the relatively brightoutlook of the Mexican economy due to increased income from oiland non-petroleum exports, record high foreign reserves andgovernment efforts to promote a modernization of the industrialsector.    "The U.S. Economy is not the same as the Mexican," he said.He did not say when he thought the market would stabilize. Reuter&#3;
