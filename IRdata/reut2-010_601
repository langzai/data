Former National Security Adviser JohnPoindexter told President Reagan on two occasions in 1986 thatprofits from arms sales to Iran were being diverted toNicaraguan rebels, according to a Time magazine report.    Poindexter resigned as head of the National SecurityCouncil (NSC) last November when the Reagan administrationdisclosed he was aware part of the profits from the arms saleswere diverted to contra rebels in Nicaragua.    The report in Time quoted unnamed friends of Poindexter'sas saying he felt he was following Reagan's orders and that hekept the president adequately informed.    "Indeed, he is likely to testify that on at least twooccasions in 1986, he told Reagan in general terms that thecontras were being helped as an ancillary or side benefit ofthe arms deal with Iran," Time said.    Reagan has repeatedly denied he knew anything about thediversion of arms sales profits to the contras.    In his nationally televised March 19 news conference Reagantold reporters Poindexter and fired NSC aide Oliver North "justdidn't tell me what was going on."    Poindexter has been granted limited immunity so he cantestify in congressional hearings on the affair. REUTER&#3;
