The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd&lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay openfor an extra five years following a new aid package from thestate government, RGC said in a statement.    The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until thedeeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.    The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved thelocal dollar copper price, making the company profitable andjustifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade ofabout 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.    Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keepcontained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mlndlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.    The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, amajor employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coastof Tasmania.    The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlradvance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessionsand deferred royalties and payroll taxes. REUTER&#3;
