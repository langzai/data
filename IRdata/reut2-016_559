Honeywell Inc said a gain of20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was theresult of cost cutting efforts which began last year.    Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earningsrose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or79 cts in the same period a year ago.    Better operating results in each of the company's three sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter dueto financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace andthe sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profitwith Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.    "Our first quarter results show clear benefits of ourrestructuring," chairman Edson Spencer said. "All of ourbusinesses are producing better results than last year, eventhough we do not see significant improvement in the externalmarket environment," he said.    Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders inaddition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.    Domestic industrial automation and control orders weremodestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.    Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation andcontrol business were flat in the U.S. and up in internationalmarkets, it said.    International orders increased, with the greatest strengthin Europe, Honeywell said.
