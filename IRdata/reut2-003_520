Shanghai plans to rely on soft loansto finance a number of large-scale projects in the cityincluding an underground railway system, Mayor Jiang Zeminsaid.    Jiang told Reuters general manager Michael Nelson that hehoped work on the railway system to ease Shanghai's transportproblems would start within two years.    Other projects in this city of 12 mln people include abridge and an extra tunnel under the Huangpu river, a newairport and passenger ship terminals and China's biggestrailway station, due to open at the end of this year.    The mayor said foreign companies would be invited toparticipate in some projects through international tendering.    But he added that firms hoping to take part would have tocome up with package deals involving soft loan financing.    "This is a complex issue. The conditions relating totendering will have to be associated with conditions forreceiving soft loans," he said.    He said the city was willing to use commercial loans tofinance technological improvements to factories which couldshow a quick return in increased exports and foreign exchangeearnings.    "But infrastructure projects take much longer and involvemuch bigger investments, and with them, the ideal way is to usesoft loans," he said.    The mayor added that British, French and Japanese firms hadalready contacted the Shanghai authorities with proposals onthe underground railway project.    Western business sources in Shanghai said the project,involving the construction of 14 km of tunnelled track, hadbeen discussed for over 20 years, adding it was expected tocost at least 750 mln dlrs.
