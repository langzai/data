Spain has revised some of its maineconomic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of theeconomy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in itsmonthly bulletin.    Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against aprevious target of 3.5 pct.    Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the centralbank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing atan annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to fourpct if the government were to meet its five pct inflationtarget this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.    The forecast for private consumption growth remainsunchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revisedupwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.    Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected toincrease by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.    Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against thedollar and slack external demand.    Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spendinghas lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from anearlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.    The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast tofive pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts lastweek on whether this target could be maintained if wagesettlements continue to rise above the government's recommendedfive pct ceiling.    Unions and employers dispute the average wage increasesagreed so far this year. Trade unions calculate wagesettlements have produced average rises of 7.3 pct against 5.5pct estimated by the employers' federation CEOE. REUTER&#3;
