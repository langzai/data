The Commodity Futures TradingCommission (CFTC) said the Kansas City Board of Trade's (KCBT)one-minute audit trail system was adequate and accurate.    But in its second rule enforcement review of an exchange'saudit trail system, CFTC said KCBT needed to provide a moreaccurate indication of the percent of trades that meet theone-minute timing standard.    CFTC also recommended the exchange develop a computerizedprogram to compare time and sales prints to the record oftrades in its trade register. Reuter&#3;
