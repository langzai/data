This morning's sharp decline in coffeeprices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiationsin London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization,ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.    "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to thefailure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but itwill not be long before reality reasserts itself and pricesrise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasterssaid.    "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffeeavailable at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said.    "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following thenews of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again toaround 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added.    Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vriessaid although the roasters were disappointed at the failure ofconsumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quotareintroduction, it was equally important that quotas bereallocated on a more equitable basis.    "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment becausethe market is well balanced and we must not lose thisopportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.    "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number ofclauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would notwelcome quota reintroduction until we have a completerenegotiation," de Vries added.    With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to havefairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for theforeseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on ahand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market priceswere below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.
