Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scalehave hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-eastsince midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).    No casualties have been reported and no further majordamage, civil defence sources said.    A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the NorthIsland some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.
