Japan should increase foreign access toits farm products market, while encouraging further developmentof domestic agriculture, a government report said.    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31said active participation in writing world farm trade rules atthe next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked aneasing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports whichstressed the need for strict controls on some products tomaintain self-sufficiency in food.    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow toimprove productivity and demand/supply imbalances.    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainlyresponsible for higher domestic prices, it said.    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices buthas also resulted in higher agricultural imports which hasworsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the papersaid.    This could make it difficult to improve the industry'sstructure, the paper said.    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product pricesto more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure thethe agricultural sector to improve productivity and make itself-supporting, it said.
