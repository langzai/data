The Reagan administration soon willpropose a program of no-fault compensation for people injuredby childhood vaccines, a senior Treasury Department counseltold the House select revenue measures subcommittee.    "Within the next few weeks, we expect to propose a programthat will provide equitable, no-fault compensation to injuredpersons, and predictable (and hence insurable) liabilities forvaccine manufacturers," Dennis Ross, tax legislative counsel fortreasury, said in prepared testimony.    The Vaccine Act was signed into law last year but did notinclude a funding mechanism for its compensation program.    Ross noted 50 to 75 children a year suffer seriouslong-term or injuries from adverse reactions to vaccine fordiptheria, tetanus and whooping cough alone.    But he said lawsuits were causing drug companies like WyethLaboratories and Parke, Davis and Co to stop producingchildhood vaccines.    The administration would not favor funding compensationthrough an excise tax levied on the vaccine producers becauseit would add to collection and auditing burdens, Ross said.    He did not suggest a favored funding mechanism but saida lump-sum trust fund for compensation might be preferable. Reuter&#3;
