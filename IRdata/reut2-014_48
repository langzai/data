The African Development Bank (ADB) saidit increased its lending by 42.1 pct last year to 1.64 billiondlrs from 1.15 billion dlrs in 1985.    A bank statement said agriculture, set as the main growtharea in a five-year economic recovery program adopted in 1985by African states, received 607 mln dlrs, 37 pct of the total.    The ADB is made up of the bank itself, its financingsoft-loan arm, the African Development Fund (ADF) and theNigeria Trust Fund, another soft-loan institution.    ADB president Babacar N'Diaye released a 1987 economicreport on Africa prepared by the ADB and the U.N. EconomicCommission for Africa (ECA), saying progress was being madetoward substantial increases in the bank's capital resources.    He said an ad-hoc committee of the ADB board of governors,comprising 18 African and non-African countries, recommended a200 pct increase in the organisation's capital for 1987-91.    He said such an increase would raise capital from around6.55 billion dlrs to 19.66 billion dlrs, adding he was hopefulthe proposal would be adopted at the annual meetings of thebank and fund, due to be held jointly in Cairo in June.    He welcomed France's recent proposals to the Paris Club ofWestern government creditors to extend repayment periods forThird World debts and give better rescheduling terms.    "The proposition represents a major step forward. ButAfrican countries should not be the ones to ask for large-scaledebt write-offs," he said. Africa's total external debt wasestimated at 175 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.    The ECA-ADB report said prospects would remain bleak forAfrican economies in 1987 but predicted Gross Domestic Product(GDP) growth ranging between 2.5 and four pct, compared with1.2 pct last year.
