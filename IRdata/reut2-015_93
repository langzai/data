J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said itsfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting itspreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual statusits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in thefirst three months of 1986.    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securitiesunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mlndlrs in the year-earlier period.    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other tradinglosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading andunderwriting of Euromarket securities.    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remaineddifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes sufferingheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whetherMorgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loanlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance forcredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs comparedwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs aftercharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a yearearlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related topersonnel costs, Morgan said. Reuter&#3;
