White House Budget Chief James Millersaid he was irritated by the Senate Budget Committee's failureto meet an April 1 deadline for completing action on its budgetblueprint for the coming fiscal year.    "I'm terribly upset that they've missed their deadline," hetold reporters after a speech commemorating the 100thanniversary of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).    Senate Budget Chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) "is obviouslyhaving trouble getting a majority (of his committee) to agreeto his budget," Miller said. The panel late Wednesday defeatedChiles' budget plan and will try again next week.    The House Budget Committee, meanwhile, approved Wednesday atrillion-dlr spending plan for the government's year beginningOct. 1, paving the way for a House vote.    Miller also told reporters President Regan remains opposedto any tax increases other than those he himself has proposed."We're not going to go along with a tax increase," he said.    Miller told a few hundred current and former ICC officialsattending the birthday party that he was an unusual choice tospeak at the event as he favored the agency's abolition.    "Let it die with dignity--and then we'll all get togetheragain for a fantastic wake," he said to mild applause. Reuter&#3;
