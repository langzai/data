The International Monetary Fund haswarned Israel in a report that a continued rapid rise in wagescould undo the achievements of its economic stabilizationprogram in controlling hyperinflation.    An IMF delegation, which visited Israel this week, issuedan interim report praising Israel's success in slashinginflation from 440 pct in 1985 to 19.7 pct last year withouttriggering mass unemployment.    But it held up Argentina and Brazil as examples of theperils awaiting countries who did not follow up onstabilization programs.    "Continued rapid rise in wages would threaten the progressin reducing inflation and the present level of employment," theIMF said.    The report echoed warnings last week by Bank of IsraelGovernor Michael Bruno and the private Bank Hapoalim thathigher wages, government overspending and a consumer boom wererekindling inflation. "Though wage developments and thereacceleration of inflation are worrisome, there is still timeto put the stabilization program back on track," it said.    The warning comes ahead of Israel's key public sector wagenegotiations next month.    Bank Hapoalim chief economist Petahia Bar-Shavit said realgrowth of wages in 1986 was about 10 pct, following a fall ofbetween 15 and 20 pct in the second half of 1985 when thegovernment's economic stabilisation programme was introduced.    Hapoalim forecast last week that inflation would rise toaround 30 pct this year and a second devaluation might benecessary later in the year, following the 9.75 pct devaluationagainst the dollar in January.    Bar-Shavit also said the government was implementing apolicy of cutting taxes without a clear strategy for balancingthe budget.    The IMF report said monetary policy was relaxed too fastlast year and it supported the Bank of Israel's raising ofinterest rates in the last month. REUTER&#3;
