Lawmakers from Ontario asked theirU.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory traderetaliation provisions in a major trade bill being consideredby the U.S. Congress.    At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, anorganization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of theOntario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, saidthe exemption would help trade relations.    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House inlate April would require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions wouldharm the U.S. economy.    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on anygrounds.    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.congressmen, "I can understand (the trade bill). I think it hasto do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."    "I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. Youdo not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerelyconsider exempting our country from that bill," he added. Reuter&#3;
