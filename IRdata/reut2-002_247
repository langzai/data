A Treasury Department spokesmanrefused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretaryof economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that theJapanese yen was undervalued.    Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, toldan Export-Import Bank conference "the yen is still a little bitundervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct."    Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officialswere aware of Ortner's comments but had no intention of makingany comment on them.    Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, saidhe thought the U.S. dollar was "fairly priced"against most European currencies and added "I do not regard thedollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said.    But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortnersaid, because it is undervalued against the dollar.    The United States and major trade allies West Germany,France, Britain, Japan and Canada met recently in Paris todiscuss maintaining stability in international currency values. Reuter&#3;
