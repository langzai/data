Prime Minister Poul Schlueter saidthe downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by the U.S. Standardand Poor's Corp was regrettable but of little practicalimportance.    3tandard and Poor's yesterday lowered the rating on Danishlong-term external debt to AA from AA-plus, saying Denmark wasless competitive with rising labour costs and this would worsenthe external account deficit and increase external debt.    Schlueter told journalists after the weekly cabinetmeeting: "It is regrettable that they have taken a plus from us,but the change will not have much practical significance."    He was echoing comments by central bank governor ErikHoffmeyer, who was quoted by the daily Politiken as saying thedowngrading would have little effect on Denmark's borrowingcapability or the interest it paid on loans.    But some bank economists said the lower rating wouldincrease the cost of national borrowing to finance the externalcurrent account deficit, which rose to a record 34.5 billioncrowns in 1986.    Denmark had total foreign debt of over 260 mln crowns atthe end of 1986.    Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said in a statement lastnight that the downgrading, the second in four years, shouldnot be over-dramatised, pointing out that the government hadalready imposed a series of austerity measures to limitconsumption and was willing to act again if necessary.    Prices fell steeply when the Danish bond market opened butrecovered somewhat after the central bank cut the overnightmoney market lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct.    The bank said the cut was due to an inflow of foreigncurrency in March, following stabler currency relations afterJanuary's EMS realignment. REUTER&#3;
