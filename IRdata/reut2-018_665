Canada's National Energy Board hasdenied an application by Quebec-owned Hydro-Quebec to exportabout three billion Canadian dlrs worth of electricity to theNew England states, a board spokeswoman told Reuters.    The decision is to be made public later today, chiefinformation officer Ann Sicotte said.    Sicotte said the board rejected tha application after fourmonths of hearings because Hydro-Quebec did not offer theelectricity first to Canadian provinces and could not prove itwas surplus to Canadian needs.    Sicotte said Hydro-Quebec can apply for a review of thedecision if there are new facts or changed circumstances, andcould also launch an appeal with the federal court or file anew application.    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said the utility hadnot yet been officially notified and will have to study thedecision before deciding what action to take.    The contract was a 10-year agreement with power exportsbeginning in 1990. "They weren't able to demonstrate that theelectricity was surplus and one way to demonstrate that is byoffering it to neighboring provinces," Sicotte said.    Hebert said the utility argued that it can generate  enoughelectricity to supply its U.S. and Canadian customers.    "Our position is that electricity is a manufacturedproduct--so everyboday can manufacture it and anybody can buysome--if they (the provinces) want to buy some from us, we'rewilling to discuss it," he said.    The application is the first the National Energy Board hasrejected outright, Sicotte said.    New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland hadopposed the contract at Energy Board hearings this spring. Reuter&#3;
