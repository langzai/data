Senator Kent Conrad, D-ND, saidPresident Reagan's goal of phasing-out world farm subsidies bythe year 2000 is doomed to failure because the EuropeanCommunity, EC, will not accept it.    "It (Reagan plan) is a nonstarter. Its absolutely crystalclear they (EC) have no intention of eliminating subsidies,"said Conrad on his return from a four-day visit to Europe.    Instead of proposing an end to farm subsidies, he said theU.S. should adopt some of the EC Common Agricultural Policy,CAP, principles by seeking a "compromise" agreement withBrussels to jointly reduce production, and apply a two-pricesystem of high domestic and low export prices. Under the plan,export subsidies would bridge domestic and world price gaps,said Conrad, a new member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Reuter&#3;
