RJR Nabisco Inc said it isunlikely that it will spin off any of its tobacco operationsinto a master limited partnership in the "immediatelyforeseeable future."    But the company, which has said was studying proposals totransfer at least a portion of its tobacco business to a masterlimited partnership, said in a 10-K filing that it willcontinue "on an ongoing basis to study all aspects of thebusiness, including the role, if any, of an MLP, with a viewtoward maximizing shareholder value."    F. Ross Johnson, president and chief operating officer,said in a statement, "After careful study, we concluded thatthe possible benefits of an MLP do not at this time justify themanagement time and attention that would have to be devoted tothe transfer to a new and difficult operating structure."    In February, RJR Nabisco said it was studying a possiblespinoff of its tobacco business to a master limitedpartnership. At that time, the company, which also has a largefood business, said at that the tobacco business was notposting the same level of profits as its food operations.    A company spokesman said RJR Nabisco will evaluate  a rangeof options for the tobacco business other than the formation ofa master limited partnership. He declined, however, to say whatthose options might be.    The spokesman also refused to elaborate on what factorswent into the company's decision not to spinoff the tobaccooperations. Reuter&#3;
