The Finance Ministry has clarifiedregulations governing fund management, satisfying overseascritics who charged the rules were too tightly-drawn, ministryofficials and Western diplomats said.    They said "double licensing" has been dropped so a foreignfund management firm need apply only for a licence for itsJapanese subsidiary and not for the parent company as well.    A foreign investment management company will be permittedto employ only one fund manager in Japan, with another onstandby in the home country. Domestic companies must have two.    In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firmis eligible to manage funds in Japan, the ministry will takeaccount of the amount of funds the parent company has undermanagement, a ministry official said.    "This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet thecriteria for a licence," he said without elaborating.    He said the ministry expects to grant the first investmentmanagement licences by the end of June. Some 135 firms,including some 15 foreign companies, will probably be licensedunder the new law passed late last year. REUTER&#3;
