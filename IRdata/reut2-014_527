Talks betweenemployers and unions in the West German engineering industryover pay and working hours broke down without result late lastnight, an official from the IG-Metall union said.    IG-Metall, Western Europe's largest union, is reviving itscampaign for a 35-hour working week and is demanding a five pctpay increase. Strikes for a 35-hour week in 1984 brought WestGermany's automobile industry virtually to a standstill.    The result of the 1984 campaign was a compromise reductionin working hours to 38.5 from 40.    The talks which broke down yesterday were in the key NorthWuerttemberg/North Baden area, which generally sets the trendfor the rest of the country.    IG-Metall official Ernst Eisenmann, speaking last night,blamed the failure of the negotiations on the employers. Hesaid they had been uncompromising on the question of theshorter week.    Hans-Peter Stihl, negotiating for the employers, said anyplan to reduce working hours gradually to 35 hours wasunacceptable.     The employers have not made an official offer on cuttingthe working week, but sources involved in the negotiations saythat they are working on the basis of a possible half-hourreduction from next year and a pay increase of 2.7 pct in 1987and of 1.5 pct in 1988.    The Union will propose that the negotiations be officiallydeclared a failure and then a process of arbitration is likely.    IG-Metall has said that cutting the working week willcreate jobs in West Germany where more than two mln people areunemployed. IG-Metall itself has about 2.5 mln members.    IG-Metall has already been staging a series of "warningstrikes" to press home demands for the 35-hour week.    Yesterday, 23,000 engineering workers struck at 90 plantsfor one to two hours, according to an IG-Metall statement.    Among the strikers were 4,000 at a Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F>plant in Bremen, and 3,100 at Ford Motor Co's &lt;F> Ford-Werke AGplant in Saarlouis. REUTER&#3;
