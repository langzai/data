European Community finance ministersdiscussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and manysaid a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was toopessimistic.    The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks agocut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.    It said economic prospects had been less promising over thepast few months because of a sharp fall in the value of thedollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which wouldrestrain Community exports.    But diplomats said several member states, led by WestGermany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,especially since it was drafted before a recent agreementbetween the leading Western economic powers to stabilisecurrencies around current levels.    "Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rathertoo pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens,who chaired the meeting.    The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for WestGermany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear itfeels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures tostimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.    But two top German officials, State Secretaries OttoSchlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need atthe moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy.    The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France,while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's viewthat Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth.&#3;
