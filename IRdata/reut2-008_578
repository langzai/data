Leading Australian onshore oil and gasproducer, Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hitby sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate andliquefied petroleum gas (LPG).    The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in netprofit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.    Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statementthat increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, alongwith reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oilexploration and development outlays, were helping Santos dealwith an adverse business climate.    Santos said it remained financially strong with aninjection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at theend of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.    It said it had also made significant progress in repayingdebts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' fundshad fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.    Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bidfor the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gascompany &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mlndlrs.    Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollardenominated and significant currency purchases were made duringthe year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.    Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oilexploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added toreserves -- less than depletion during the year.    Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year schemeto double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget foroil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.    Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices andproduction volumes but with extra oil exploration andencouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.    But it called on the goverment to continue fosteringdomestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.    "It makes no sense to abandon this policy now whenexploration is at its lowest level for many years and whenAustralia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,"Massy-Green said. REUTER&#3;
