The Philippine 1987 inflation rate willrise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the governmentimplements an employers' association recommendation for a 10pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.    The government's own proposal for an across-the-board dailypay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eightpesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year averagehigher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by theEmployers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflationrate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solitasaid. Both were proposed last month.    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pctby the National Economic and Development Authority early thismonth.    In the first three months of the year, inflation was anegative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National StatisticsOffice said.    The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pctin July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and Septemberrespectively, the National Statistics Office said.    It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and waterprices.    The government's six and eight peso wage increases woulddisplace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the numberof unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population. REUTER&#3;
