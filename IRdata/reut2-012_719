A Swedish Finance Ministry committeeforecast that British Petroleum Plc &lt;BP.L> may have to closeits refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worseningof the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.    It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refiningbusiness was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oilconsumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of ruleson sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstadfacility of &lt;Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.    The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks ade-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unlesscostly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacityto refine a broader range of products.    But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had inrecent years been above that of the European refining industryon average. The BP plant, in which Sweden's state-owned &lt;OKPetroleum AB> has a 22 pct, started up in 1967 and has anannual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.    There was nobody at British Petroleum immediately availablefor comment.&#3;
