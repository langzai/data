Twenty pct of the capital of Himont, in which Montedisonand Hercules originally planned to take 50 pct stakes, has beenfloated publicly and marketing and production agreements havebeen modified on the Commission's advice, it said.    Himont, which is incorporated in the U.S., Groups the twofirms' assets in the polypropylene sector.    The modified agreements include the abandoning by Herculesand Montedison of all their direct activities within the EC inthe downstream market of Himont.    The EC authority said the modifications meant that thecreation of Himont did not appear to lead to restrictivecoordination of activities between Hercules and Montedison, nordid their respective market shares give them a dominantposition.
