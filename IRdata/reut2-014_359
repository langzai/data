U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said a textile bill, widely expected to be offered asan amendment to trade legislation on the House or Senate floor,is "pure protectionism."    "Its attachment to a trade bill would kill the bipartisan,cooperative spirit needed to produce growth-oriented,market-opening legislation," he said in a speech prepared forthe University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.    President Reagan vetoed that bill last year and wouldalmost certainly reject this year's bill, he added.    "We simply cannot accept legislation that would provokeretaliation against American exporters, destroy the UruguayRound, and embroil us in dozens of trade wars," the traderepresentative said.
