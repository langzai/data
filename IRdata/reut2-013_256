An extension of the International TinAgreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowedto lapse, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto toldreporters.    Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session ofthe International Tin Council on April 8-9, Subroto saidIndonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to lookinto how to replace the pact.    But he said that given the present disagreement betweenproducers and consumers, there is unlikely to be any follow-upto the ITA.    Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extensionof the ITA, he said, "No one will propose that. It's alsounrealistic to do so."    Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between theseven member Association of Tin Producing Countries tointroduce a quota system which limited their exports andconsumption to 96,000 tonnes in the year starting March 1.    Indonesia's quota was set at 24,516 tonnes. REUTER&#3;
