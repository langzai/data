Assets of Offshore Banking Units (OBUs)in Bahrain rose 11 pct in the second quarter of 1987 to reachthe highest level since early 1985, Bahrain Monetary Agency(BMA) figures show.    The BMA's quarterly statistical bulletin gave no reason forthe sharp rise, but economists said banks appeared to bestaying liquid because of the escalation of the Gulf crisis.They said banks are parking funds in interbank markets outsideBahrain.    Despite the rise in assets, banks in Bahrain have beenretrenching operations considerably. At the end of 1986 therewere 68 OBUs compared with 74 at the end of 1985.    BMA figures show OBU assets rose to 58.30 billion dlrs atthe end of June from 52.53 billion at the end of March and55.68 billion at the end of 1986. The mid-1987 figure was thehighest since early 1985 when assets topped 61 billion.    The second quarter rise came almost entirely in OBU assetsoutside Bahrain. The volume of loans to the non-bank sectordeclined slightly, indicating a still sluggish economy in theregion, economists said.    Assets of commercial banks in Bahrain were slightly lowerat the end of the second quarter at 2.05 billion dinarscompared with 2.10 billion at the end of the first quarter. REUTER&#3;
