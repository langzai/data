The United States and Japan are waging abehind the scenes battle at this week's Asian Development Bankmeeting over Tokyo's attempts to win a greater say in theorganization, U.S. And Japanese delegates said.    Washington is opposing the Japanese efforts because itwould mean the end of the long-standing parity between the twonations in the Bank, U.S. Officials said.    Right now, the two countries' voting shares are aboutequal, Japan having 12.53 pct and the United States 12.36 pct.The slight difference is due to a temporary delay in the U.S.Subscription to the Bank.    "It's quite a delicate matter," Japanese Finance Ministrydeputy director general Fumiya Iwasaki told Reuters. "I don'tsee the discussion ending soon."    The issue is further complicated because other membernations would have to give up some of their power in the Bankif Japan were to increase its influence, he said.    Tokyo raised the issue at last year's annual meeting inManila, arguing that the 3.7 billion dlrs it has contributed tothe Bank's soft loans fund entitled it to a greater say in theoverall organization. The United States has given 1.2 billiondlrs to the Asian Development Fund. REUTER&#3;
