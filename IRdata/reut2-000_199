An unmanned Delta rocketcarrying a 57 mln dlr weather observation satellite blasted offhere today in the first U.S. Space launch of the year.    The 116-foot rocket lifted off at 1805 local time (2305GMT) and placed in orbit a 1,850 pound GeostationaryOperational Environmental Satellite (GOES) to replace anidentical one that was destroyed last May when a Delta rocketexploded after liftoff.    Weather forecasters have had only a single satellite tocover the entire U.S. Since another GOES failed in orbit inAugust 1984.    "We'll have both our weather eyes open again," said ThomasPyke, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, which owns and operates the satellite.    The smooth launching came after two delays in as many days.The first was caused by a fuel leak and the second by powerfulcrosswinds.    The Delta was the first of six rockets scheduled for launchby the National Aeronautics and Space Administration this year.The launch marked the third straight success for the spaceprogram which was battered by a series of failures in 1986,including the loss of the Challenger shuttle.
