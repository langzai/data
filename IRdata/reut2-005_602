Advanced Micro Devices saidit plans to build the first of a new generation of 32-bit CMOSmicroprocessors designed to operate three to five times fasterthan the 32-bit devices currently built.    The new microprocessor is capable of sustained performanceof 17 mln instructions per second and has a peak of 25 mlninstructions per second, the company said.    It said the new device is suitable for engineeringworkstations, super-minicomputers, laser printer controllersand other high-performance applications. Reuter&#3;
