Treasury Secretary James Bakerdeclined to comment on whether President Reagan would reappointPaul Volcker to a third term as chairman of the Federal ReserveBoard.    "I spent four years and two weeks in the White House job refusing to comment on personnel matters," he said in aninterview with the Cable News Network. "I'm not going to changenow."    But Baker did say Volcker has "done a tremendous job" andadded they get on "extremely well", both when he was White Housechief of staff and during his term at Treasury.    When asked whether he differed with Volcker oninternational economic policy, Baker said "there's really nodifference of opinion between us with respect to these matters."    In other comments, Baker said he did not think a tax risewas a good idea and nor did President Reagan. But he believedCongress would enact some spending cuts. "The minute you sayraise taxes, all restraints on spending go by the board."    He once again pointed out that taxes were 19 pct of gnp butspending was at 24 pct, a statistic he used to argue stronglyfor spending cuts. reuter&#3;
