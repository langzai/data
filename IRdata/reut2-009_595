U.S. Agriculture SecretaryRichard Lyng today publicly expressed doubts that the federalgovernment would meet the fiscal year 1988 deficit reductiontarget set by the  Gramm-Rudman law.    "I don't think anyone believes we'll meet the 108 billiondlr target," Lyng told the Virginia Farm Bureau.    Lyng is believed to be the first top administrationofficial to publicly express doubts the target would be met.    The remark was quickly disavowed by the White House Officeof Management and Budget (OMB). "His 'no one' does not includethe OMB," said spokesman Edwin Dale.    Lyng made the remark while describing the need for theagriculture sector to share the burden of cutbacks under lastyear's Gramm-Rudman law.    "There needs to be some reduction of some expenditures to atleast get close to the Gramm-Rudman figure," he said."Agriculture would not be independent from that."     Lyng's special assistant, Floyd Gabler, said the remarkwas an opinion based on Lyng's discussions with congressmen.    "If the Secretary said that he's simply expressing anopinion he's gotten from the progress or lack of progress onthe Hill," he said. Reuter&#3;
