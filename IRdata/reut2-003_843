Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA>, which wantsto acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, isnot likely to give up without a fight if its target seeksanother buyer, arbitrageurs said.    Speculation that Dart's offer of 41.75 dlrs per share couldbe just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarketsshares gain one to 42-1/8  on 2.3 mln shares.    One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc &lt;FDS> takinga look at Supermarkets General. "Our policy is that we do notcomment on any rumors or speculation of this nature," aFederated spokeswoman said.    An arbitrageur noted that Dart, controlled by chairmanHerbert H. Haft and his son Robert, last year raised itsinitial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct whenSafeway resisted.    However, that company was later sold to a buyout group thattopped the Hafts.    If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bidto 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, thearbitrageur said. But another arbitrageur said the Hafts'present bid seemed "quite fair." He said the offer amounts to10 times after-tax-cash flow which is "probably fully priced." Reuter&#3;
