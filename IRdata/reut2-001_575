Central Bank director Daniel Marxsaid Argentina's creditor banks were divided on the country'srequest for rescheduling its foreign debt.    "There are difficulties (among the banks) to reach anagreement and find a unanimous decision," Marx told a localradio station in a telephone interview from New York.    Argentina's great efforts to comply with obligations on its50 billion dlr foreign debt should be met by a reduction ininterest rates on the part of the creditor banks, he said.    Marx is in New York with Argentina's debt negotiating teamholding talks with the creditor banks' steering committee.    Marx said the talks should not drag on. "If Venezuela andMexico have concluded their negotiations, we want to end (ours)in a reasonable manner and as soon as possible," he said.    Economy ministry sources said the steering committee wasexpected today to make a counter-proposal not unlike that madeby Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn at the start of thetalks between the two parties.    Argentina is seeking a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet fourpct growth targets in 1987. It also wants lower interest rateson its foreign debt. The United States said last week it wouldsupport a 500 mln dlr bridging loan for Argentina. REUTER&#3;
