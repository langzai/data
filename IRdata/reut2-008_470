International Business Machines Corp,hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back bythe end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst RickMartin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.    "There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit notuntil later this year," Martin said at a technology conferencesponsored by the investment firm.    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new productintroductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drasticimprovement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs inmid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at149-1/2 dlrs.    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the companyitself, have highlighted the external economic factorshampering IBM's growth.    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understandingthe rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, andpointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view."By replacing the product line, earnings have soared," he saidof DEC's line of VAX computers.    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatiblemid-range product line. A new computer code-named "Fort Knox"was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-rangesystems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into theIBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects shouldbe unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. "The major story will be arebound in its mid-range business."    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growthin mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are comingto the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth willdrop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martinsaid. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of51.3 billion dlrs.    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earningsand stock have been propelled by a strong slew of productintroductions in the mid-range area.    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat toDEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies werecatering largely to existing customer bases, rather thanstealing market share from one another.
