U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lynghas asked Japan to open its farm market further to helpWashington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionistpressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.    Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's EconomicAffairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture MinisterMutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would helpJapan as well as the United States.    The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan byLyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.    However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan wasalready the world's largest grain importer.    Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain anddepended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its foodrequirements in 1985.    Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farmproducts named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as onbeef, citrus products and rice.    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level ofself-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus ricebecause potential production is higher than domestic demand.    The world farm market suffers from surpluses because ofrising production by exporting countries, he added.    Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm productoutput with expensive programs, Maki said.    Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussionson each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talksat a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter will join.
