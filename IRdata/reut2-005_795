Orion Royal Bank has decided to withdrawfrom making markets in floating rate notes (FRNs), an officialof Orion said.    He said the decision to withdraw was made about 11 days agobefore the market was battered by a loss of confidence, whichresulted in sizeable losses in these securities.    The official, who declined to be identified, said Orion,the merchant banking arm of Royal Bank of Canada, had operatedprofitably in the market from 1984 to date. However, thedecline in the market made it appear that they could no longerjustify the overhead.    The official said Orion would redeploy the three traderswho had been in the FRN sector, mostly to their Euro-commercialpaper operation, an area the bank believes has a greater growthpotential.    Officials at several other firms, who also declined to beidentified, said they were reviewing their position to decidewhether to continue making markets in FRNs.    In trading earlier today, traders said prices of severaldated FRNs had firmed slightly and that some buyers werebeginning to re-enter the market. REUTER&#3;
