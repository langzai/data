General Motors Corp has changed itsmethod of disbursing merit raises for salaried employees and isreducing the size of the merit raise pool to 3.5 pct of thetotal amount available for salaries from 5.5 pct last year, acompany spokesman said.    He said GM will no longer include merit raises in thecalculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sumpayments.  As a result, the merit raises will not be includedin the calculation of pensions and other benefits.  The changeaffects about 109,000 salaried workers in the U.S. and Canada.                                           GM last year eliminated cost of living increases forsalaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. Asa result of the new action, GM has effectively frozen the basepay rates of salaried employees.    The spokesman said GM is making the change to remaincost-competitive with other U.S. automakers.    GM is currently in thje midst of a program to cutemployment of salaried workers by 25 pct. Reuter&#3;
