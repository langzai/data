The European Community is to offerArgentina compensation for its loss of maize and sorghumexports to Spain following Spain's accession to the EC, ECsources said.    They said the offer will be made next week in Geneva,headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), and will also involve products other than cereals. Theygave no further details.    Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero lastyear from 300,000 tonnes in 1985, while maize sales fell to15,000 tonnes from 994,000, official EC statistics show.    The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and theU.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for twomln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum eachyear for the next four years.    But they said various details of this accord will tend toinhibit imports from Argentina.    These include a provision for reduction of the amounts ifSpain imports cereals substitutes, and the EC's plan to importthe special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis.Argentina tends to have exportable quantities only three orfour times a year.
