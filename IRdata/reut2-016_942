He said "in order to be fully divested by August 1988, wewill probably have to sell an average every week of between 50mln and 75 mln dlrs of stock."    The stocks sold in today's program sale include AbbottLaboratories &lt;ABT>, Allied Signal Inc &lt;ALD>, CitiCorp &lt;CCI>,Ford Motor Co &lt;F>, General Motors &lt;GM>, Gillette Co &lt;GS>, H.J.Heinz &lt;HNZ>, IBM &lt;IBM>, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing&lt;MMM>, Mobil &lt;MOB>, Monsanto Co &lt;MTC>, NCR Corp &lt;NCR>, PepsicoInc &lt;PEP>, Pfeizer &lt;PFE>, Union Camp &lt;UCC>, USX &lt;X>,Westinghouse Electric &lt;WX>, Weyerhaeuser Co &lt;WY>, AmericanInternational Group &lt;AIG>, CBS &lt;CBS>, Coca-Cola &lt;KO>, Merck&lt;MRK> and Upjohn &lt;UPJ>.

"The total value of the sales to date," Machold said, "areabout three billion dlrs in book value and about four billiondlrs in market value."    He said that because of the difficulty of definingcompanies that do business with South Africa, it is difficultto determine exactly how much future sales will be worth.Machold estimated the book value of future sales to August 1988will be in the range of 1.2 billion dlrs to 5.2 billion dlrs.
