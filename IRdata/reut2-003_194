U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mlnstg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster,a spokesman for Lloyds of London said.    It could take weeks before the extent of the compensationclaims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also beforeit was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged,said David Larner of Lloyds.    The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprisewere valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by TownsendThoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental SteamNavigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.    The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market withLloyds and various other companies, Larner said.    Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the StandardSteamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of severalshipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were alsounderwritten by Lloyds and other companies.    Larner said claims from passengers could be expected tototal at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and thenormal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death.    Shipping sources said, however, that these claims couldsoar if a court found there was negligence or design faultsinvolved.    Larner said estimates of compensation claims "were pureguess work" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged,the claims would total at least 30 mln stg.
