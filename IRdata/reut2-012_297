Democrats rammed through the HouseBudget Committee a trillion dollar U.S. spending budget for1988 over Republican protests.    After a brief partisan debate in which Republicans saidthey were kept in the dark about the plan, the committeeapproved the budget by voice vote and sent it to the fullHouse.     It was the first major congressional action on a U.S.budget for the government year starting October 1 this year.    President Reagan has had his own budget virtually ignoredby Democrats and fellow Republicans alike.    The House budget would cut the deficit about 38 billiondlrs off an estimated 171-billion-dlr deficit for a 133-billion-dlr deficit, using Congressional Budget Officeestimates.    Using President Reagan's more optimistic economicassumptions, committee Democrats said the deficit would be 107billion -- the goal of a new budget law designed to graduallyend deficits by 1991.    The estimated deficit for this year is about 175 billiondlrs. Reuter&#3;
