The Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants,which could lead the way to the licensing of controversialplants in New York and New Hampshire.    The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of publiccomment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuationstandards of its own.    Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island,N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part inevacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.    They had claimed the region was too populated for any safeevacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue fullpower licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.    A group of prominent politicians, led by New York GovernorMario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed planon Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protectingthe utilties'investments than protecting public safety.    An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency hadnot yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.    In a statement today announcing its vote, the commissionsaid the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act incases where local authorities refused to take part in emergencyevacuation planning.
