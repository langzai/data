A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumptionsince the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicateshome brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lostvodka sales, Pravda said.    The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales hadincreased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned intotwo billion bottles of moonshine.    At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached theequivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenuesfrom vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.    "Official statistics show a reduction in consumption ofvodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not counthome-brew," Pravda said.    "The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now alsofirmly settled into cities, where the availability of naturalgas, running water and privacy has made it much easier."    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcoholcampaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a firststep to improving Soviet economic performance, which had beenseriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.
