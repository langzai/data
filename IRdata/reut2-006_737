Emhart Corp said it plans to increaseworldwide revenues and earnings at an annual compounded growthrate of 15 pct and about 13 pct, respectively.    It said these objectives were based on several assumptions,including a four pct average inflation rate through 1989 and atwo pct to three pct GNP real growth.    In 1986, Emhart reported a net loss of 10 mln dlrs or 35cts a share, after a 90 mln after-tax restructuring charge,which realigned the company's assets.    Emhart has divested itself of many of its units to focus onthree primary markets--industrial products, consumer products,and information and electronic systems.    Emhart said industrial products should account for about 62pct of projected 1987 revenues of 2.3 billion dlrs, whileconsumer products should account for about 20 pct of thoserevenues and information and electronic systems about 18 pct.
