The Bank of Canada, the country's centralbank, believes economist Alan Greenspan was a sound choice toreplace retiring U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, aspokesman for the bank said.    "Mr. Greenspan is well known to the bank. He's had a lot ofexperience. He's very capable, and with Mr. Volcker's decisionnot to seek reappointment, he's a sound choice," said RoyFlett, associate secretary for the bank.    Flett said, "the Bank of Canada has enjoyed an excellentrelationship with Mr. Volcker during his terms and has only thegreatest respect for his performance."    Economists said the appointment was extremely important toCanada because the country's monetary policy is closely linkedwith that of the U.S.    "Basically, we have chosen ... to march in lockstep withU.S. monetary policy, so really in some sense this is ourcentral banker that has just been appointed as well," said MikeMcCracken, head of Infometrica Ltd.
