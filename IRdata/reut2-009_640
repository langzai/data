Pacific Dunlop Ltd &lt;PACA.ME> saidstudies by its &lt;Ansell International> latex-product unit haveshown a commonly-used spermicidal cream kills the AIDS virus.    Ansell regional director Chris Humphrey told a newsconference the cream, already used in a condom brand asadditional contraceptive protection, killed on contact thevirus causing AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).    The discovery meant sexually active people could have asecond level of protection against AIDS if a condom rupturedduring sex, Humphrey said. "This is the best availableprotection against AIDS next to abstinence," he said.    But David Pennington, the head of Australia's governmentsponsored AIDS taskforce, said the use of the cream provided aslight safeguard but was no great breakthrough.    Pennington said that in the event of a condom rupturingsemen was likely to travel beyond the cream's range.    Humphrey said the studies, commissioned by Ansell fromNelson Gantz of the University of Massachusetts and Fred Judsonof the University of Colorado, showed nonoxynol-nine destroyedthe AIDS virus present in 100 pct of rupture tests.    But he said it was not known whether nonoxynol-nine was aseffective in sexual situations.    He stressed it was neither a cure nor a vaccine for AIDS.    Humphrey said nonoxynol-nine had been used for about 20years as a spermicidal cream without side-effects.
