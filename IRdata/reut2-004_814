Mobil Corp made a 15 pct reduction inits long term debt in 1986 from the previous year according todata in its 1986 annual report.    Mobil chairman, Allen E. Murray said in his report toshareholders, "that lower debt and our strong cash andmarketable securities position improves Mobil's flexibility."    Long term debt as of December 31, 1986 was put at 7.9billion dlrs, down 15 pct from 9.3 billion dlrs on the same dayin 1985.    Mobil has moved to reduce debt at high interest rates,which may reduce interest payments.    Murray said that with the results from 1986, "we're payingback 3.8 billion dlrs in the past two years, or the equivalentof 66 pct of the debt incurred in 1984 when we bought SuperiorOil."    Mobil said that it has about 183 mln dlrs of long term debtwhich is due in 1987 although this will rise appreciably to 1.2billion dlrs of long term debt due in 1988.    At the end of 1986, Mobil said it also had an existingeffective shelf registration with the Securities and ExchangeCommmission to permit the sale of 205 mln dlrs of debt.   Mobil's debt reduction program has also been abetted byseveral steps taken by the company to restructure itsoperations.    Mobil's Murray said in his remarks to shareholders that thecompany was continuing to dispose of assets which did not fitthe company's long range plans and had realized some 1.1billion dlrs from the sale of its Container Corp subsidiary.
