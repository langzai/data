Bolivia's proposal to repurchase at adeep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercialbanks is likely to be accepted, central bank governor JavierNogales Iturri said.    Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of theInter-American Development Bank (IADB) here, Nogales saidBolivia's bank advisory committee, led by Bank of America, isseeking permission from creditor banks worldwide to go aheadwith the scheme. More than 50 pct of the banks must give theirapproval, and Nogales said he is confident that this thresholdwill be reached.    "It's working out very well, and I think we'll get clearmajority," Nogales said.    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banksare responding positively and said all the legal waiversnecessary could be obtained within two months.    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt inMarch 1984. Hyperinflation has been curbed and public spendingtrimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on thedollar on the secondary market and many banks have written offmost, if not all, of their loans to the country.    Bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery inBolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect whatthey can on the loans.    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at amarket price. He said some banks might want to hold out for ahigher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as awindow of opportunity to cut their losses.    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid thatforeign governments, especially the United States and WestGermany, are providing to help finance the eradication of cocacrops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal cropsinstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,Nogales said.    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some fourpct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increasedto pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of nimpact on inflation, he added.    Nogales said he did not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase tobecome a model for other debtors in dire straits. "We're notseeking a universal solution," he said."              Reuter&#3;
