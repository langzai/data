Assistant Treasury Secretary DavidMulford said rapid progress was being made in talks withcommercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines andBrazil.    "This should result in substantial new lending for themajor debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for theSubcommittee on International Development Institutions of theU.S. House of Representatives.    Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude newfinancing packages pending completion of a Mexican package,Mulford said.    "We are concerned about the backlog of other financialpackages and would like to see these move ahead soon," he said,"There is some evidence that this is already happening.    Chile signed an agreement with banks last week, and therewas also an agreement with Venezuela on rescheduling principalpayments on previously renegotiated debt.    "We look for rapid progress in commercial bank discussionswith Argentina, the Philippines, and ultimately Brazil," hesaid. Reuter&#3;
