Zambia will reintroduce a modifiedforeign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of anew two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor LeonardChivuno said.    Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeksof negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) thatthere would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactionsand a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other typesof business.    The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions todistribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determinethe kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the endof January.    President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he wassuspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluationand violent fluctations of the exchange rate which hadresulted.    Business and banking sources said another reason forsuspending the auction was that the central bank was low onforeign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successfulbidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction systemwas first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.    Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate ofabout nine kwacha per dollar. REUTER&#3;
