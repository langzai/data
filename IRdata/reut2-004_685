Japanese securities houses have asked theFinance Ministry again to consider introducing auctions of10-year government bonds, securities sources said.    Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said theMinistry has been aware of growing calls from securities housesfor 10-year bond auctions.    Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokersto underwrite more 10-year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banksare expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late Aprilto operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as theyhold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.    These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which willincrease the number of participants in the 10-year governmentbond primary market, securities managers said.    Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in thesyndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.    In order to expand participation by foreigners, thesyndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pctshare or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.    Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, nowFuji Bank Ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banksoppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said. REUTER&#3;
