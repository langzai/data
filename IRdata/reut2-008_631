Iran has test-fired its newly acquiredSilkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and hasset up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, aBritish naval source in the Gulf said.    The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran hadfired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulfnaval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.    "These missiles pack a fairly big punch," he told Reuters."There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping)across the Strait of Hormuz."    Tension in the Gulf has risen since U.S. Officials lastweek broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkwormmissiles.    The U.S. Has said it will not allow Iran to use themissiles to choke off oil shipments and has offered itswarships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries.    But Tehran denied last Sunday it intended to threaten Gulfshipping and warned the U.S. Any interference in the regionwould meet a strong response.    The British naval source said the Silkworms were in placeat at least two sites around the Strait of Hormuz, but wouldnot give the exact location. REUTER&#3;
