Iran has deployed about six largemissiles near the Strait of Hormuz which increase the threat toshipping in the Gulf, the New York Times said.    The paper quoted U.S. Intelligence sources as saying themissiles appeared to be of a Chinese design known as HY-2 whichis based on the Soviet SSN2 or Styx missile.    Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles.    It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites andquoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink asupertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz.    Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of theexplosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker onlywith a lucky hit, the paper said. None of the new missiles hadbeen fired yet, it added.    The CBS television network reported on Friday that Iran hadinstalled new missiles along the Gulf and said Washington hadwarned Tehran not to use them against civilian shipping. REUTER&#3;
