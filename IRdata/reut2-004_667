Employers in Rotterdam port'sstrike-hit general cargo sector have been served with aninjunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing withplans for 350 redundancies this year, an employers'organisation spokesman said.    An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legalfault in the employers' redundancy procedure.    The employers' spokesman said they were likely to restartthe redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt topre-empt the May 7 final court ruling.    Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmullerdescribed the court ruling as a victory for the union, butadded there was still a long way to go before the dispute thathas hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks wasresolved.    Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sector's4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in thecampaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 inprotest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 thisyear.    The employers said there were no immediate plans formeetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies oron a new work practice agreement in the sector.    Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in theport's grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated,although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector,the employers' spokesman added.
