Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency (IEA) said.    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by aroundone pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said inits Monthly Oil Market Report.    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices arehigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may bebelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said.    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product pricesstay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users canbe expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain someof the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and theremay be slightly less growth in transport fuels.    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.    The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fellby 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of theyear. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd buta decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reportedstocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments builtup strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in theperiod.    The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, moreor less in line with consumption, after declining for fiveyears, the IEA noted.    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,respectively.    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to94 days of consumption.    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mlnbpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports fromcentrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the firstquarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpdof crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln averagefor the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was thelargest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEAsaid.    Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd. REUTER&#3;
