U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said a possible recession in western Europe or Japanwas possible as a result of the U.S. dollar's decline and theresulting drop in the U.S. trade deficit.    Yeutter told the Senate Finance Committee, "They certainlyhave the macroeconomic policy tools to adjust" to the U.S.reduction in imports.    Asked if the U.S. trade deficit was preventing them fromgoing into a recession, Yeutter replied that result was"certainly possible" and was the reason why they should adjusttheir monetary, fiscal and tax policies.    Asked by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) whether the U.S. tradedeficit would improve more if the value of the dollar droppedfurther, Yeutter replied, "That should be a mathematical truism."But he added that markets are more complicated than that.    He said he expected the current decline in the dollar toshow up soon in the decline in the value of imports.    He expected the U.S. would soon start importing less fromJapan and Europe and would start exporting more to Europe wherethere's less rigidity on imports. Reuter&#3;
