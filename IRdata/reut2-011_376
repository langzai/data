A new grade of unleaded gasolinenow being test marketed will increase refining costs whenrefiners can least afford it, according to officials attendingthe National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here.    The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regularunleaded gasoline.     Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has test-marketed the new mid-gradegasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South,East and Midwest by the beginning of June, according to PaulCollier, executive vice president of marketing.    Phillips Petroleum &lt;P> expects to begin marketing the new89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.    Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89octane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions ofdollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacityand intensity of the refinery, said Amoco's Collier.    But not all oil company's welcome the introduction ofanother grade of unleaded gasoline.    "Three grades are not warranted," said Henry Rosenberg,chairman of Crown Central Petroleum &lt;CNP>. "Refiners will haveto upgrade again," he added.    "An investment will have to be made," said Archie Dunham,executive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, anoperating subsidiary of DuPont Corp &lt;DD> in order to upgraderefinery operations.
