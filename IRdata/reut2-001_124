Firestone Tire and Rubber Co hasnotified the United Rubber Workers the company will close itsDes Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tireplants on or before September 15.    A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will becovered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the companytook in the fourth quarter of 1986.    The company said it was notified by the union March onethat the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma Citytire plant had been rejected by union members at the otherplants.     Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale ofits Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyersfor several months.    Those discussions are continuing, the company said, addingit could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing towork with any organization wishing to consider the purchase ofthe three tire plants, it added.    Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plantsin Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were beingdesignated as "distressed" under the terms of its masteragreement with the rubber workers.    Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with theleadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plansto reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefitsand work rules.    Union procedures, however, require approval by theFirestone section of the union's International PolicyCommittee, membrs of other locals covered by the mastercontract and by the rubber workers' executive board.    The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City packageby union locals at Des Moines and other locations and thelimited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural andoff-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to concludethe parties would be unable to reach agreements that wouldpermit the continued operation of the Des Moines andBloomington plants.
