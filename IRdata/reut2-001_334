Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruitcoupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that growerprices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.

In view of the strong demand and seasonally reducedsupplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.    During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processednoncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.
