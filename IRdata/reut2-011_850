Cash grain dealers reported slow countrymovement of corn and soybeans across the Midwest, with evencorn sales from PIK-and-roll activity seen earlier this weekdrying up.    Some dealers said the USDA may further adjust the postedcounty price at the Gulf to take into account high bargefreight rates as a way to keep corn sales flowing, but addedthe current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see ifit will work as hoped.    Corn and soybean basis values continued to drop on theIllinois and MidMississippi River due to the strong bargefreight rates. Toledo and Chicago elevators were finishingloading the first corn boats of the new shipping season,supporting spot basis values at those terminal points.
