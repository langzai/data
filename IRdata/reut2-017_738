Rep. Mike Synar said today that whilePresident Reagan is ready to use military force to protectKuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-preparedat home to deal with a new energy crisis.    Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in commentson a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharingprogram of the International Energy Agency.    The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, wasformed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to dealwith any future oil cutoff.    Synar said, "the president is prepared to take militaryaction to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling totake less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare ournation for the next energy crisis."    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilersto assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action ina previous IEA test, said the United States successfullyadvocated a test limited to training participants in oilsharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.
