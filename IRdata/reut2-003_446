The European Community (EC) Commissiondeclined to give an official reaction to reports that a groupof european operators plan to offer one mln tonnes of sugarinto intervention in protest at Commission export policies.    However, a spokesman for the Commission confirmed theoffers had been made to intervention agencies in various memberstates, and said it would now take up to three weeks for theagencies concerned to complete all necessary documentation.    The spokesman said that under current regulations, the ECwould have to accept all the offers if there were no technicalproblems.    The spokesman said the Commission would only have toreimburse the member state for the cost of buying-in the sugarafter the product was sold out of intervention stores at alater date.    He said that at present there was virtually no sugar heldin intervention stores.    Last year, 45,000 tonnes were sold into intervention andduring the 1984-85 campaign 108,000 tonnes. REUTER&#3;
