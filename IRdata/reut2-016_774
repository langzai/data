A strike by machinistsagainst Eastern Airlines is very likely before the end of theyear and Eastern pilots would probably honor the picket line,the president of the airline pilots' union said.     Capt. Henry A. Duffy, president of the Air Line PilotsAssociation, told a group of aviation executives meeting inAtlanta Duffy said the pilots' union has a contract through1988 with Eastern Airlines.    However, a contract between Eastern and the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is due toexpire this year, Duffy said.    If the machinists strike, which seems likely, Easternpilots probably would refuse to cross picket lines, he added.    Noting that the pilots' union had clashed several timeswith Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp &lt;TEX.A>, Duffy said, "Wehave had a difficult relationship with Texas Air wherever theyhave existed in the industry."    Eastern's pilots had picketed the airline recently over newsick leave policies and Duffy repeated criticisms of thosepolicies in his speech today.    "The new policies pressure us to try to fly when we're sickagainst federal air regulations and pressure us to fly beyondfederal air limits," Duffy said. "For all those reasons, we don'tsee a very happy future over there." Reuter&#3;
