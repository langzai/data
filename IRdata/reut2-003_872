A Portland-based woodproducts company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with theIraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq,Edward Niedermeyer, president of Niedermeyer-Martin Co saidyesterday.    Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs sub-committee onInternational Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that thesales agreement contains an option that could make lumberexported worth more than 20 mln dlrs.    The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, inaddition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department ofAgriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodityunder the credit guarantee program, he said.    Niedermeyer said the government export credit guaranteeprogram (GSM-102) administered by the USDA was the key toopening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured byScandinavian lumber producers.    "This is the first time we have been able to sell woodproducts in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it wouldnot have been possible. We hope this will lead to a long termexport market for U.S. lumber products."    He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feetto 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing,construction and furniture manufacturing. He estimated theprofit potential for his company on the sale at five to sixpct.    Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the salelate last month and early March. He is a member of the UnitedStates-Iraq Business Forum, a non-profit group designed topromote commerce with Iraq.    The forum members include Westinghouse and GeneralElectric, but Niedermeyer's company is the only wood productsfirm on the membership roster. Reuter&#3;
