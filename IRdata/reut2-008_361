Deputy Prime Minister Janez Zemljaric,speaking before a meeting with the Paris Club of creditornations, said Yugoslavia was seeking to refinance two billiondlrs of debt.    The official Tanjug news agency quoted Zemljaric as sayingYugoslavia expected a "definite measure of understanding" from 16western creditor countries when they meet on March 30.    Zemljaric was not quoted as saying whether the two billiondlrs referred to principal or interest or both. Yugoslavia'shard currency debt stands between 19 and 20 billion dlrs.    Zemljaric said the International Monetary Fund criticisedYugoslavia for not regulating consumption, not having realinterest rates or market exchange rates, for its inability tocontrol monetary policy and slow pace of reform.    He said the criticisms were in a report by an IMFcommission which visited Yugoslavia last December and January.    "We cannot accept this assessment because we have made notinconsiderable progress under difficult conditions, even thoughwe are aware of our own weaknesses," Zemljaric said.    He said the report favourably assessed some trends in theYugoslav economy but did not say which.    Milos Milosavljevic, also a Deputy Prime Minister, saidlast Friday that Yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs ofprincipal and 325 mln dlrs of interest so far in 1987.    According to official Yugoslav figures, Yugoslavia repaid arecord 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986.    In an interview with the West German weekly magazine DerSpiegel, Prime Minister Branko Mikulic said last weekendYugoslavia had repaid 28.3 billion dlrs in principal andinterest between 1981 and 1986.
