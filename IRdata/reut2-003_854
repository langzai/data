The Wall Street Journal said thestocks of Owens-Illinois Inc &lt;OI> and Inco Ltd &lt;N> will bedropped as components of the 30 stock Dow Jones Industrialaveage, effective with the start of trading on the New YorkStock Exchange tomorrow.    They will be replaced with Coca-Cola Co &lt;KO> and Boeing Co&lt;BA>.    The paper, which is published by Dow Jones and Co Inc &lt;DJ>,said the change in components will require revision of thedivisors used to calculate the industrial average and therelated 65 stock composite index to maintain the statisticalcontinuity of the indices. The new divisors will be publishedin tommorw's editon, it added.    It explained that Owens-Illinois, which has been one of theDow 30 since 1959, is the object of a leveraged buyout. Thetender offer is set to expire March 16.    The Journal said Inco is being dropped to substitute astock that will make the index more representative of themarket. Previously named International Nickel Co, Inco is oneof the original components of the index established in 1928.    While the Owens-Illinois deletion was forced, the Incosubstitution is being made solely to improve the market-sectorweighting of the index, not because of any change in thecompany, the paper stated. Such substitutions are made fromtime to time, most recently with the addition of McDonald'sCorp &lt;MCD> in October 1985, to reflect long-run changes in theeconomy and the market, it added.
