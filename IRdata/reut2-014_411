U.S. stock index futures dropped in active late afternoon trade and closed near daily lows.    The selloff followed an early rally that had sent June Sand P 500s to a new contract high of 306.10. Arbitrage buyprograms were triggered when the June S and P reached a 3.20point premium over the spot index, traders said.    However, weakness in the bond market in afternoon tradesparked selling in June S and Ps, sending the nearby contractto a discount which triggered the unwinding of buy programs,traders said. June S and Ps fell through chart support at296.00 which also sparked technical selling.    Value Line futures closed down 6.85 to 7.00, S and P 500futures fell 7.65 to 7.85, NYSE futures dropped 4.60, and MMIfutures ended 10.65 to 11.00 points lower. Reuter&#3;
