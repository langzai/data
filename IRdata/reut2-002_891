The outlook for Australian industrialinvestment is uncertain, with capital spending at an historicallow and business overly dependent on domestic demand, theAustralian Chamber of Manufactures and the National Instituteof Economic and Industry Research said.    The organizations were commenting in their monthly EconomicFocus on a survey commissioned by the Australian Council ofTrade Unions concluded.    Private investment as a proportion of gross domesticproduct fell to 9.8 pct in 1985/86 from 15 pct in 1981 and isforecast to decline to 8.8 pct in 1987/88, the Focus said.    Earlier studies indicated private investment could sustaina two pct long-term economic growth rate, but the latestfigures suggested this could not be maintained, it said.    The Australian dollar's depreciation, coupled with researchincentives, is increasing the profitability of investment forexports but several factors inhibit growth. These include weakcommodity prices, high fixed capital costs, uncertain domesticeconomic policy and corporate debt.    Firms have tended to finance expansion with debt ratherthan equity, leading to a 39 pct rise in the ratio of interestpayments to gross cash flow between 1980/85, the survey found.    Economic Focus said many companies looked for a 2.5 to 4.5year payback on capital investment or export development --often too short a period to secure markets.    The relatively low incentive to produce for export in partreflected the ownership of Australian industry, they said.    Sixty-seven pct of Australian-owned companies said externaldemand was conducive to investment against only 27 pct forforeign-owned companies.    The survey covered 45 companies accounting for about 25 pctof total investment, Economic Focus said. REUTER&#3;
