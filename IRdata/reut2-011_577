Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct-owned by ExxonCorp &lt;XON>, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliersconcerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta'sshut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented onJune 1, a company spokesman said.    "From our point of view, it's a question of entering intonegotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes tocontracts to reflect the changes that are going to take placeon June 1," spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to aquery.    Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspendedits oil supply contracts, Cote said: "It's not a question ofcancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point."    On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Boardwill lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system,regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on atrial basis to the end of 1987.    Under the new system, producers and refiners will beallowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be deliveredunder purchase contracts.    Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount ofoil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.    "We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, andwe've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing hasbeen finalized," Imperial's manager of western crude supply GaryStrong said.    Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match areasonable supply of crude against the company's forecastdemand for its refineries, Strong said.    "We have to know what they have and how that relates to whatwe need in total," he said.    Strong said figures on the amount of crude productionImperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediatelyavailable. Reuter&#3;
