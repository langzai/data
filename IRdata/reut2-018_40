European Community officials welcomedNorway's recent move to renew a public debate on Communitymembership but said Norway should not expect special tradeadvantages as long as it stays outside the EC.    Belgian Willy de Clercq, EC Commissioner on externalaffairs and trade policy, said high level talks this week withNorway's minority Labour government had helped clarify severalmisconceptions that led to Norway's narrow rejection of ECmembership in a 1972 referendum.    "But you (Norway) cannot be in the club and remain outsidethe club. You can expect equal footing in the club, but not outof it," de Clercq added, referring to Norway's attempts to adaptits EC trade ties in the face of Community moves to launch aninternal trade market from 1992.    The government, worried that the internal market willhamper trade with the EC, which takes about two-thirds ofNorway's exports, last month sent a report to parliament askingpolitical parties and the public to reassess the country'srelationship to the EC.
