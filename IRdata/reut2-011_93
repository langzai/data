The U.S. Department ofTransportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to theproposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by AmericanAirlines Inc.    "The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessencompetition or to be inconsistent with the public interest," theDOT said in a statement.    AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is aunit of AMR Corp.    The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger planFeb. 20.    American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms ofrevenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively smallcarrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is thenation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would notalter American's third-place ranking, according to datacompiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.    The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.    The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantiallyreduce competition on the four routes on which both carriersprovide either nonstop or single-plane service.    At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOTsaid it found no evidence that other carriers could notincrease or begin service that competed with a mergedAmerican-AirCal.    Concerning the 14th, "While entry may not be possible at theOrange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that theservice provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, willprovide effective competition for Orange County travelers inlong-haul markets," the DOT said.    The merger would give American control of 37 pct of theauthorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange Countyterminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminalbuilding limit future opportunities for expansion.    The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed commentsopposing the merger but "raised no new facts or arguments."    Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American willpay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings. Reuter&#3;
