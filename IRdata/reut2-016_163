A takeover battle began today fordebt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> as TransCanadaPipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer andDome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potentialbuyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd&lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had anotherproposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with athird company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in astatement.    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,but did not identify the companies involved in talks.    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipelineoperator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, commonand preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary whichwould own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offeris to Dome management, not to shareholders.    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violatedthe terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement enteredinto with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed toprevent Dome from considering other proposals.    It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable andsubstantial taxation concessions from the federal andprovincial governments." But Dome added that its management andfinancial advisers will evaluate all proposals.    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said hewas surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and deniedthat TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome'sstatement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision toauthorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announceit," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of theother bidders, or the terms of other offers.    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on theToronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981. REUTER&#3;
