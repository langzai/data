Economics Minister Martin Bangemann saidthe state could not continue to pour money into West Germany'sailing steel and coal industries because the subsidiesendangered other parts of the economy.    "The situation is completely absurd from an economic pointof view," Bangemann told the newspaper Die Welt in an interviewreleased ahead of publication tomorrow.    "We are subsidising the production of mineral coal and steelto an enormous extent and at the same time putting a hugeburden on all other branches of industry and making themuncompetitive," he said.    Bangemann said the steel and coal industries were no longercapable of being competitive. Continued state subsidies wouldnot save them but would only prolong their lives artificallyfor a few years, he said.    "That is why I have refused to continue subsidising them inthe way that we have done in the past," he said.    Several steel firms have announced plans to reduce theirworkforces, citing weak prices and lower exports due to thestrength of the mark and tough foreign competition.    Bangemann said everything possible would be done to findnew jobs for the workers affected by the cuts. REUTER&#3;
