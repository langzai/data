U.S. drilling activity fell last week,with the number of active rotary rigs dropping by five to 761,against 1,137 working rigs one year ago, Hughes Tool Co said.    The drilling rig count, which historically falls during thefirst quarter of each year, has dropped steadily since earlyJanuary when a total of 962 rotary rigs were working. Hugheseconomist Ike Kerridge said the U.S. rig count was expected tofall to a about 700 working rigs by mid-April.    "I think we're pretty much on track with the expectationthat the seasonal low will come in late March or early April,"he said. "We're getting close to the bottom."   Among individual states, Texas and Oklahoma reported gainsin drilling activity last week, with increases of 21 and 13,respectively. Kerridge attributed the jump in activity to thelikelihood that many of the rigs were omitted from the previousweek's count because they were in transit or being prepared forwork. In the week ended March 9, the rig count for Texas andOklahoma fell by 23 and 13, respectively.    Other states reported slight decreases in drilling activitylast week, Hughes said. Wyoming and Louisiana were down by six,Kansas and Colorado lost four and Michigan and West Virginiawere down by three rigs.    Most of the week's decrease came among rigs used foronshore drilling, which dropped to a total of 669 from lastweek's 671. A total of 74 rigs were active offshore and 1 wereworking in inland waters during the week, Hughes Tool said.    In Canada, the rig count was up 1 to 181, against 367 oneyear ago. Reuter&#3;
