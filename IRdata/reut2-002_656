Outboard Marine Corp's top executivesare making sales presentations to portfolio managers andanalysts ahead of a planned two mln share offering expectedsoon, company officials said.    Chairman Charles Strang and Wayne Jones, vice president forstrategic planning, are meeting with portfolio managers in NewYork and Boston to line up interest for the offeringunderwritten solely by Morgan Stanley, the officials said.    Outboard Marine has been the subject of recurring takeoverrumors, with one rumor this week naming Sun Chemical as thepotential suitor for 40 dlrs a share.    Sun Chemical is said to have 4.9 pct of Outboard and isconducting a study on whether to bid for control of the marineengine and boatbuilding company. A Sun Chemical spokesmandeclined to comment.    Stanley Fishman, analyst at Fahnestock and Co, said it isbetter for a suitor to bid for Outboard before the two mlnshares are sold. Outboard now has 17 mln shares outstanding.    "Even though Outboard would use proceeds from the shareoffering to pay down debt, and there would be less debt theacquiring company would assume, it still means more shares thesuitor must buy to acquire the company," he said.    Fishman, who has heard the Sun Chemical rumor, said a 40dlrs a share would just open the bidding.    Outboard Marine today was trading at 33-5/8, down 5/8.    "There are only two companies that count in the marineleisure business, Brunswick Corp &lt;BC> being the first. But youcan't play down number two," He said. "It's a growing field.There's a lot of leisure money out there. I think 40 would be aminimum price. It will be higher."    A Morgan Stanley spokesman said the offering has beenapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission but akick-off date and price have not been set. Reuter&#3;
