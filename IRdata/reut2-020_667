Economist Ravi Batra, whose book warningof a crash on Wall Street has been a best seller all summer,said Monday's record-breaking market drop was no reason topanic.    "I think (investors) should stay in the market. Don'tpanic. The time to panic is two years from now," Batra, aprofessor at Southern Methodist University, told Reuters bytelephone from Pittsburgh, where he was to deliver a lecture atRockwell International Corp.    Batra's book, "The Great Depression of 1990," predicts thatthe increasing concentration of U.S. wealth will lead to adepression.     He said Monday's 508-point drop was set off by last week'snews of the trade deficit "and other things that added to thetotal jitters."     However, he called the fall a "mini-crash," due in part toa change in people's attitude to the market. "In the 1920s,people thought the market would never come down," he said, "Buttoday, people think it will come down at some point, andtherefore when it does, everyone wants to get out."     "It turns a mini-crash into a maxi-crash," he said, butadded that he did not see it falling any further.     He said he expects the government to announce by the endof the week an agreement with Japan and West Germany to bringinterest rates down.     "Once (interest rates) come down, the market will calmdown," he said, adding the government had other options, suchas acting on program trading, that it might be able to use tostabilize the market.     "But in two year's time, the government will run out ofoptions," he added. Reuter&#3;
