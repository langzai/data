Privately-held softwaredeveloper SAPC Inc said it has filed suit in U.S. DistrictCourt in Boston against Lotus Development Corp, alleging theinfringement of a copyright and the misappropriation of tradesecrets and is seeking 100 mln dlrs in damages.    The firm's suit alleges that Lotus' spreadsheet program1-2-3 violates the copyright of VisiCalc, which was developedby SAPC several years ago, before 1-2-3 was introduced, whenthe firm was known as Software Arts Inc.  Software Arts soldrights to VisiCalc to Lotus in 1985 and changed its name.    The suit also alleges that Lotus founder Mitchell D. Kapor,who resigned as chairman in July 1986, breached aconfidentiality agreement with SAPC.  Kapor, also named as adefendant, had worked for a firm that had marketing rights toVisiCalc before founding Lotus.    The suit alleges that Lotus and Kapor deliberately soughtto make 1-2-3 look and feel like VisiCalc by copying a numberof commands, keystrokes and screen displays.    Lotus, in response, said it feels the suit is without merit. Reuter&#3;
