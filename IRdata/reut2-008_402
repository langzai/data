Duke Power Co said it began itslicensing process for a new hydroelectric power plant on ColeyCreek, near the towns of Cashiers, N.C., and Salem, S.C.    Duke said it will decide whether to pursue the project oncethe licensing process is completed.    In order to be producing electricity by the turn of thecentury, the company said, it needed to start the four to sixyear licensing process now.    If the site is developed to its full potential of 2,100megawatts, its cost will be slightly greater than three billiondlrs, including projected effects of inflation. Reuter&#3;
