Pillsbury Corp, reporting lowerearnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strongperformance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Groupdeclines.    Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operatingprofit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as salesrose four pct.    It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higheroperating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale,which introduced a new menu.    Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, BurgerKing's distribution arm, and said increased investment spendingon developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill- hurt results.    It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items,rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breadsand baking products major contributors to improvement in thequarter.    A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor inprofit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.    Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlrprofit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on thesale of a joint interest in an Australian food company andlower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an earlyretirement program initiated a year ago.    Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 ctsa share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from1.46 billion dlrs.    Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per-share earnings by ninects in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months.    As a result of the act, it said its effective income taxrate rose eight points to 48.1 pct in the quarter and 5.5percentage points to 49.7 pct for the nine months. Reuter&#3;
