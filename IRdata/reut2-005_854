There will be no significant changesin U.S. agricultural policy this year, said Senate Minorityleader Robert Dole (R-Kan).    Speaking at the annual convention of National Grain andFeed Association, Dole said that while the current farm bill isnot perfect, "I still believe it is a step in the rightdirection."    Dole said he would like to reduce the costs of the programbut that expenditures will continue to be high until the U.S.becomes more aggressive in its export policy through either thebroader use of the Export Enhancement Program or theimplementation of a market loan for wheat and feed grains.    Commenting on whether the U.S. should offer the SovietUnion subsidized grain, Dole said, "If your going to trade withthe Soviet Union you have to be competitive."    He said one way to get around the problem of making directsubsidies to the Soviets would be to implement a market loan,which he said would make U.S. commodity prices competitive.    Prospects for passage of mandatory production controls,specifically the Harkin-Gephardt mandatory bill, are not good,he said. "Mandatory has less support now than it did a year agoand it will have even less support when people understand it,"he said.    If the House passes a pending 0/92 bill for 1987 winterwheat, the Senate will try to address 0/92 for a one yearperiod, Dole added. Reuter&#3;
