The Nigerian government will carry out amajor review of import tariffs by the end of July, said memberof the ruling council and chief of general staff Rear-AdmiralAugustus Aikhomu, seen as the government's number two.    "The comprehensive review will take care of items like spareparts for vehicle assembly plants and machinery" he said.    The government last reviewed tariffs in February followingthe depreciation of the Nigerian naira by over 60 pct since thecurrency was allowed to float last September.    Aikhomu said the review was only an interim measure.    Manufacturers saw the tariffs unfavourable to localindustries.    Aikhomu repeated the government had not decided to removethe remaining petroleum subsidies.    He dismissed arguments that the move would increasehardships faced by the poor due to the government's tougheconomic adjustment programme as "sentimental and baseless."    Last year, the government cut fuel subsidies by 80 pct butthis has since been lost to the naira's depreciation which hasmade oil products cheap and a target of smuggling toneighbouring countries.
