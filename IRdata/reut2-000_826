Central bank governor Chang Chi-chengrejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of theTaiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losingorders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman forthe Taiwan Textile Federation said.    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textileassociations last Saturday the government could not fix theTaiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due toU.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to holdthe exchange rate at that level.    The federation said in its request that many local textileexporters were operating without profit and would go out ofbusiness if the rate continued to fall.    It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct againstthe U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean wonclimbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollarsremained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period, it said.    Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollarwill rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end.    Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan'sability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year.    The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs incalendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985, official figures show.    Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in Januaryto 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986, the samefigures show.    Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner, afterelectrical and electronic products.    Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last yearfrom 6.2 billion in 1985. Exports to the U.S. Last year wereworth 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs. REUTER&#3;
