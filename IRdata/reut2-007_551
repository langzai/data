The London Commodity Exchange (LCE) andInternational Petroleum Exchange (IPE) are to introduce revisedtrading slip systems incorporating the time that futuresbusiness is executed, an LCE spokeswoman said.    The LCE's six week trial system starts on April 1, withbuyers and sellers filling in slips which carry not only thetransaction, but also the date and time of execution.    These slips will then have to be forwarded to market stafffor entering into International Commodities Clearing House(ICCH) terminals within 15 minutes of the trade beingtransacted, the spokeswoman said.    The IPE system is similar, although here traders will usetime-stamping machines which automatically enter the date, asis the practice on futures exchanges in the U.S. And on theLondon International Financial Futures Exchange.    Time-stamping of U.K. Futures business becomes mandatorylater this year under the Financial Services Act, to meet theSecurities and Investments Board's requirement on audit-trails,the LCE spokewoman said.
