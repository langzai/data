A former TRW Inc controller told aCongressional hearing that the company had acted unethically inits defense contracts with the government.    "It is my contention that the company called TRW is not evervigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. TRW onlypretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fitstheir financial interests," Larry Eagleye said in testimony at aHouse Oversight subcommittee hearing.    Eagleye was a controller at TRW's compressor componentsdivision in Cleveland.    Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said he did notunderstand why the Defense Department had taken no actionagainst TRW even though it admitted in the 1984 report that ithad substantially overcharged the government for militaryaircraft parts.    "In 1984, TRW officials admitted to the Defense DepartmentInspector General that they had evidence of two sets of booksand other problems in one of the company's divisions inCleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging ofthe federal government on various military aircraft parts,"Dingell said.    "For example, by falsifying its books and records, TRWinflated the price of a military engine blade by two to threetimes higher than the price of a virtually identical commercialengine blade," Dingell said in a statement.    Eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit againstTRW last year charging the company with overcharging thegovernment. The Justice Department later joined the suit.    "While employed by TRW and while under investigation by TRW,I disclosed to TRW's legal department and higher management,many flagrant and obvious violations of law, company policy andethical conduct. None of this evidence was included in TRW's(1984) report to the government," he said.    Reuter&#3;
