A public opinion poll showed PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives maintaining theirlead over the opposition Labour party as Britain's June 11general election campaign entered its third week. The poll,conducted for TV-AM breakfast television by the Harrisorganisation, put the Tories on 43 pct, Labour on 35 and thecentrist Social Democrat-Liberal Alliance on 20 pct.    If translated into parliamentary seats in a generalelection, Thatcher would enjoy an overall majority of 50.    Since the general elections were announced on May 11,Thatcher's Tories have maintained the lead.    A survey of marginal seats for The Times of London, carriedout by the MORI organisation, showed that Thatcher would sweepback in with an overall majority of l40 seats, the same marginshe enjoyed in the 1983 general elections.    The Times poll of marginal seats where Labour ischallenging a Conservative incumbent -- and which it must winin order to dislodge the Tories -- showed the Conservativeswith 42 pct, Labour with 34 and the Alliance on 23.    If the result were repeated on polling day, Labour wouldwin only a handful of the marginal seats, giving Thatcher alandslide. REUTER&#3;
