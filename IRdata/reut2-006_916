The European Community (EC) farmers'and farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed theEC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisationmechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers.    In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans,current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said themechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidiseoils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances.    This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oilprices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted.    If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmersshould not be the ones to suffer through their prices andincomes from the financial consequences, the letter, madeavailable to journalists, said.    Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initiallyresult in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and ECproduced oils and marine fats.    The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, andpossibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rosefrom present levels. REUTER&#3;
