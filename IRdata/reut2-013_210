Gulf States Utilities Co saidits condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that itsoperating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unlessit receives additional financing or rate relief from statepublic utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.    In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-Kfiling, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified theutility last month that no additional credit would be granted.Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to beginmaking prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more thanthe estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.    "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the companymay have to seek protection from its creditors under thebankruptcy code," Gulf States said.    The utility had previously said it might be forced toconsider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rateincreases granted by state regulators in connection with GulfStates' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.    "If the regulatory commissions approve the company'sproposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases providedfor in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"Gulf States said.    In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission grantedGulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrscontingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line ofcredit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.    Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana stateregulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs inemergency rate relief.    In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs onsales of 1.85 billion in the previous year. Reuter&#3;
