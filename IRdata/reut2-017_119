Fine weather throughout Europeallowed farmers to make good progress with sugar beet sowingsduring the period April 16-21, but conditions in the SovietUnion remained unfavourable, West German analyst F.O. Lichtsaid.    With daytime temperatures in parts of Europe exceeding 20degrees centigrade Licht said sowings have been boosted and maybe completed in most countries by the end of the month.    In France the beet growers' association said the entirecrop could be sown within a week if the good weather persists.    Sowings this year will still be behind 1986 but Licht notedthat good results have often been produced from late-sowncrops.    In the Soviet Union, however, most beet-growing regionsstill had cool weather with night frosts. Only in the westernUkraine was it warm enough to permit sowings, Licht said.    Sowings in the USSR will consequently be much later thanlast year when one mln hectares had already been drilled bymid-April. Reuter&#3;
