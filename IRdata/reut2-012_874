The British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> saidit had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg, despiteforecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it mightbe planning such a move.    The committee said the refinery's future looked bleakbecause the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness wasexpected to worsen unless it invested, and because of theeffects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content.    But BP said the unit, in which Sweden's &lt;OK Petroleum AB>has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically andfinancially up to and including the first quarter of 1987.    Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known futureplans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it anyserious problems, it said in a statement.    The refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacityof 4.7 mln tonnes. REUTER&#3;
