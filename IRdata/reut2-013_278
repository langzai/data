Japan's Ministry of International Tradeand Industry (MITI) is considering buying a U.S.-builtsupercomputer worth three to four billion yen, but a finaldecision and funding have yet to be determined, MITI said.    The Cray II computer, made by Cray Research Inc &lt;CYR>,would be used jointly by nine MITI research institutes inTsukuba, northeast of Tokyo, a MITI official told Reuters.    Its purchase would be in line with MITI's goal of boostingimports, he said.    Funds for the supercomputer are not included in the fiscal1987 budget currently stalled in parliament.    Funds could be provided in a supplementary budget likely tobe introduced this autumn, the official said.    The U.S. Has strongly urged Japan to open its public sectorto sales of U.S. Supercomputers, and the complaint is a keyissue in current U.S.-Japan trade friction.    One year before it was privatised in April 1985, &lt;NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) bought a Craysupercomputer, an NTT official said, the only public sectorpurchase of a U.S. Supercomputer to date.
