Japan's 1987 car exportrestraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough, ECexternal trade chief Willy de Clercq said.    There are also strong signs Japanese exporters arediverting cars to the EC after the dollar's fall against theyen made their U.S. market unprofitable, he told reportersafter meeting U.S., Japanese, and Canadian trade ministers.    The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversionin Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due tocurrency movements over the past two years, it will move toprevent it, he said.    Over the period, the yen has risen against the dollaralmost eight times as fast as against the European CurrencyUnit, he said.    Japan has set an unofficial, voluntary 10 pct rise in carexports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop itsrising trade surplus with the Community, which hit a record 18billion dlrs last year.    But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumpedover 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales, and aseven per cent fall globally. "We think there is some diversionthere," said de Clercq. Reuter&#3;
