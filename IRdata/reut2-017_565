PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> analyst JohnPincavage says most airline stocks are undervalued in relationto record industry earnings expected in 1987.    Noting that the airlines as a group earned 85 mln dlrs inthe first quarter of 1987 compared with a loss of 625 mln dlrsin the first quarter of 1986, Pincavage sees an improvement ofsimilar magnitude in the current quarter. He believes earningsfor the group will total about one billion dlrs in the secondquarter of 1987 compared with 250 mln dlrs in earnings in thesecond quarter of 1986. "We're shaping up for a record year in1987," Pincavage told Reuters.    For the third quarter of 1987, Pincavage expects the groupto earn about 1.5 billion dlrs compared with one billion dlrsin the same period of 1986.    Noting that the summer quarter is always a peak period, hesays "at this point it's too soon to tell" about trends in thelatter months of 1987. But he says for the group as a whole,fare discounting practices are not pressuring earnings likethey were last year.    Pincavage has not changed any recommendations recently,maintaining buys on Texas Air Corp &lt;TEX> NWA Inc &lt;NWA> and AMRCorp &lt;AMR> and rating most others attractive. Reuter&#3;
