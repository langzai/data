Britain can look forward to fairlystrong economic growth, falling interest rates and firmSterling, Barclays Bank Plc chairman-elect John Quinton said.    "We should see a reasonable decline in interest rates inthe next few months, but not a great one and not a rapid one,"Quinton told a press luncheon.    He said that whereas the British economy is growing atabout three pct, he expects only "minor" growth for the westernindustrialized world as a whole. But, unless there is a majormove toward protectionism, there should be no need to worryabout a recession in the next two or three years.    Quinton said much will depend on the resolution of tradedisputed between the United States and Japan.    He said Tokyo, in resisting the appreciation of the yen,had been "holding back the laws of economics." But if thedollar has to fall further to reduce Japan's trade surplus, hesaid he hoped the fall would be slow rather than rapid.    Quinton said it will be difficult for the City of London tostave off the creation of a powerful securities industryregulatory body along the lines of the Securities and ExchangeCommission in the U.S., especially if there are more insidertrading scandals and if the Labour Party wins the next U.K.election.
