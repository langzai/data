Spanish Secretary of State for theeconomy Guillermo de la Dehesa said the government maintainedits five pct inflation target for this year although a 0.6 pctincrease in March pushed the rise in the year on year consumerprice index to 6.3 pct.    De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by theNational Statistics Institute, was not entirely satisfactorybut acceptable.    The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct.Prices rose 8.3 pct last year.    The March rise included a 0.05 pct increase correcting anerror in last January's consumer price index. Economists hadearlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct.    De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushedthe index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower inApril.    The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the Marchprice rise showed inflation was going up again and thegovernment looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pcttarget.    The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelledunions's claims to wage increases beyond the government'srecomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct.    Spain is being affected by a two-month-old wave of strikesfor wage rises. Government officials note wage settlements sofar this year have yielded average increases upwards of sixpct, while unions say the figure is higher then seven pct. REUTER&#3;
