Kidder, Peabody Mortgage Assets TrustFive, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mlndlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes,including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches.    Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rateclass has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be resetquarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11pct cap.    Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains aso-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapturepossible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.    For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct duringthe life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar,the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs didnot carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.    Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.    The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and hasan initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. Thistranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officersaid.    The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has aninitial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterlyaccording to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.    Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs, the balance of the500 mln dlr issue, range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct, or 90 to 160basis points over comparable Treasuries.    The issue is rated a top-flight AAA by Standard and Poor's. Reuter&#3;
