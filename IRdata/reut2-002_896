Japanese securities houses are thinking ofallowing foreign brokerages to underwrite more Japanesegovernment bonds from April, securities managers said.    The average foreign brokerage now underwrites only around0.07 pct of each such issue's volume, they told Reuters.    The proposal is a response to overseas calls for Japan toliberalise its markets in the trend towards global trading.    Japanese brokerages are consistently heavy buyers of U.S.Treasury issues. &lt;Nomura Securities International Inc> and&lt;Daiwa Securities America Inc> were named primary dealers inU.S. Government securities in December, they noted.    Brokerages within the government bond-writing syndicate arenow negotiating by how much foreign house subscriptions togovernment bonds should be raised, the managers said.    The syndicate members agreed in April, 1982 that 26 pct of10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93securities firms, 17 of them foreign, and 74 pct by banks.    The Finance Ministry later approved the arrangement.    Foreign brokers want to underwrite more government bondsdue to their end-investor appeal. &lt;Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd>caught market attention by buying 45 billion yen of the 100billion of government two-year notes auctioned on February 3.    Salomon's operation was an attempt to demonstrate itscommitment to the Japanese market in the hope of expanding itsunderwriting share of 10-year bonds, securities sources said.    They said that to expand participation by foreigners, thesyndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pctshare, cut local brokerages' share, or introduce auctions tothe government bond primary market, the sources said.    Bankers are likely to oppose losing any share and theFinance Ministry is unwilling to introduce auctions on theground that it would slow smooth absorption of bonds in thesecondary market, securities manager said.
