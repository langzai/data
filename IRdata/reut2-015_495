The number of cards in the Eurochequesystem, Europe's biggest personal payments system, grew by 11pct to 39.1 mln last year and is expected to continueincreasing by around 10 pct in coming years, EurochequeInternational Secretary General Mark Van Wauve said.    He told a news conference Eurocheque cards can now be usedin 40 European and Mediterranean countries to back Eurochequeswritten in local currency and, where facilities are available,as electronic debit cards. The system would have 5,000automatic cash dispensers by the end of this year and aimed tohave 25,000 throughout Europe by 1992.    Eurocheques and cards are issued by banks in 21 countries.    Van Wauve said Italian banks, who already acceptEurocheques, had recently asked to be allowed also to issueEurocheques and cards to their clients. It was possible thesewould be launched in Italy this year if the Rome governmentagreed to lift exchange controls that prevent residents writingcheques abroad in any currency but lira, he told Reuters.    Eurocheque International, the system's Brussels-basedcoordinating centre, was also reviewing a request from theSoviet Union for permission to issue cheques and cards.    Eurocheque's agreements with banks do not permit them tocharge commissions from clients using Eurocheques, and VanWauwe said problems with French banks that have demanded suchcommissions had been reduced to a minimum last year.    Eurocheques can also be used to pay in local currency forgoods and services bought in over five mln retail outlets in 28countries, with Hungary, Tunisia and Greece added to the systemthis year. East Germany last year became the 40th country toaccept Eurocheques, made out in dollars, at banks and shops.    Eurocheque International estimated the total of Eurochequesused nationally and internationally at over one billion a year. REUTER&#3;
