Congressional Democratic leadersannounced a compromise has been reached on a 1988 budget,paving the way for final approval of a trillion dollar spendingplan.    House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority Leader RobertByrd told a news conference that final congressional approvalof the plan to reduce an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit nextyear to 134 billion dlr was expected next week.    The plan was worked out by Democrats who control both Houseand Senate but who have been stalemated for a month overdifferent House and Senate budgets that passed earlier.    The budget proposes 19.5 billion dlrs in new taxes nextyear, 65 billion dlrs over a three year span.    It would cut President Reagan's request to spend 298billion dlrs for defense in 1988 by about nine billion dlrs,but only if he accepts the proposed tax increase to pay for it.    If Reagan rejects the tax rise, which he has said he would,defense spending under the plan would drop automatically byabout five billion dlrs, the leaders said.    Reagan's own budget was rejected by wide margins in bothHouse and Senate by a combination of Democrats and his ownRepublican party who said it was unrealistic. Reuter&#3;
