Belgian Budget Minister GuyVerhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in severalstate-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena andthe postal and telecommunications authority, government sourcessaid.    They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francsin revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt'sprojections, helping the government to reduce its huge budgetdeficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.    But the scheme had received a guarded reception from theSocial Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalitionwhen Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.    Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult,the sources said.    Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the lastquarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of stateinvestment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise threebillion francs, they added.    A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal andtelecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages inmid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.    Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime TransportAuthority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savingsbank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.    Le Soir daily quoted CGER vice-president Paul Henrion asexpressing strong opposition to the privatisation of his bank.    "Public company we are and public company we wish to stay,"Henrion told the paper. REUTER&#3;
