Marvin Warner, a former U.S.ambassador to Switzerland, was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in jailfor his role in a bank failure that led to the worst bankingcrisis in Ohio's history.    He owned the Home State Savings Bank of Cincinnati at thetime of its March 9, 1985, collapse following more than 143 mlndlrs in loses.    Warner and two other bank officials were charged with 82counts of misapplying the bank's funds by transferring them toESM Government Securities Inc., of Florida without theauthorization of the bank's board.    ESM collapsed in March of 1985, taking Home State -- itsbiggest investor -- down with it.    Home State's failure wiped out the reserves of its insurer,the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund, a state regulated institutionthat was not federally insured. That prompted a run on dozensof other savings and loan associations across the state whichwere insured by the same fund, forcing some of them to closeuntil they obtained federal deposit insurance.    Warner was ambassador to Switzerland during the Carteradministration. Reuter&#3;
