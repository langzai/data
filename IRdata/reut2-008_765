A House taxwriter said EnergySecretary James Herrington's "outrageous" plan to restore an oldtax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy.    Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior HouseWays and Means Committee member, said Herrington's plan for a27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.    "He must have missed the last two years of federal taxreform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle," Stark said.    He said in a statement the oil industry already pays aneffective lower rate of U.S. tax on investment, 15 pct versusaggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct, accordingto a recent Congressional Research Service study.
