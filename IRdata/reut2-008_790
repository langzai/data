CRS Sirrine Inc said it plans a majorrestructuring of its balance sheet that will include awrite-off of between 39 mln and 43 mln dlrs, most of whichwould be intangible goodwill from the company's pastacquisitions.    The company said the remainder of its write-off wouldinclude a one-time expense for future costs related to earlyretirement programs, office consolidations and an increase inthe general reserve for adjustments and contingencies.    Bruce Wilkinson, president of the company, said the chargesto the company's third quarter earnings, for the period endingMarch 31, would "significantly impact" third quarter resultsbut would not affect the company's cash position.    "We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in thecompany's history by June 30, 1987, the end of our fiscalyear," Wilkinson said. "We believe the action being proposedwill begin to contribute to improved earnings in the fourthquarter of our fiscal 1987 and throughout fiscal 1988."    The company, which is one of the nation's largestconstruction firms, also said termination of its definedbenefit retirement plan would produce a pre-tax benefit ofabout 10 mln dlrs due to overfunding of the plan.    In its second quarter ended Dec. 31, CRSS had net earningsof 800,000 dlrs on revenues of 82.5 mln dlrs. Reuter&#3;
