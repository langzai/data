Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>, the 99 pct ownedsubsidiary of Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fellby around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previousyear.    Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a newsconference he expected both profit and turnover to rise thisyear compared with 1986, but he said it was questionablewhether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted lastyear that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecifiedamount from 1985's record levels.    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10billion this year.    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help theparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audiwould ensure VW got a share of profits.    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own freereserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 yearsVW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to outputcaused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, oncurrency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. Aboutalleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models.    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pctto 59,800 last year.    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottomout in 1987.    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180in 1985.    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in thefirst two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overallmarket share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in thesame months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Salesfell further, he said without giving details. Worldwidedeliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to57,000.    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise toover 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallencompared with 1985's 392,000.    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead tofurther new hiring of employees.    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985. REUTER&#3;
