White House Budget chief JamesMiller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might"overreact" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar byraising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recessionnext year.    "Our greatest danger is overreaction," Miller told newspaperreporters yesterday. "I'm concerned about the Fed'soverreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent datashowing a substantial fall in the money supply."    Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, publishedin the New York Times today, were accurate.    Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact tosignals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move hesaid could have "political consequences."    The White House budget chief appeared to be referring tothe effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidentialand congressional elections next year.    "My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deepsoup, and there is no question about it," he said.    Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower taxrevenues and a widening of the budget deficit.    Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. centralbank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means ofbolstering the dollar.    Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal ReserveBoard Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that furtherdeclines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardizeglobal growth prospects.    U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany tostimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move thatcould boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionistpressures in the United States.
