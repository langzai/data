The Governor of the Bank of England,Robin Leigh-Pemberton, repeated his criticism of Citypredators, describing them as "thoroughly irresponsible."    "I have been concerned when predators have sought to use aminority shareholding to unsettle a perfectly well-managedcompany and to create an atmosphere in which a bid becomesdaily expected," he said in a speech to the Industrial Society.    "Such activity can amount to a thoroughly irresponsibleexercise of shareholder power, and an abuse of the arrangementswe have for the protection of shareholders' interests," he said.    Leigh-Pemberton was resuming a theme he developed in aspeech last week, when he attacked the practice of "putting acompany into play."    This is when predators use a minority shareholding to forcea company's management into action which will raise thecompany's share price. The predator then withdraws, takingsubstantial profits.    In today's speech, Leigh-Pemberton said it was hard to findthe right tightrope to walk between intervention and adherenceto a free market philosophy. REUTER&#3;
