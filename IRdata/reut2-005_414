Members of the United Food andCommercial Workers union, UFCW, local 222 voted Sunday to go onstrike against Iowa Beef Processors Inc Dakota City, Nebraska,plant, effective Tuesday.    The company submitted their latest offer to the union atthe same time announcing that they would end the lockout as oftomorrow that started December 14.    Members unanimously rejected the latest company offer thatwas submitted to the union late last week. An overwhelmingmajority of the approximately 2,500 members attending themeeting then voted to go on strike, UFCW union spokesman AllenZack said.    Zack said the company's offer for a cut in wages wasunacceptable and said IBP was refusing to bargain in goodfaith.    IBP's latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hourfor slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay forprocessing workers. The cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in payworkers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lastedsince then, Zack said.    The offer also eliminated overtime after eight hoursfollowing the normal 40 hour work week, he added. Reuter&#3;
