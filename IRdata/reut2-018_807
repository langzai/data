A compromise reached between Gulf CanadaCorp and debenture holders at the annual meeting today willcost the company or its major shareholder "a couple of million"dollars, chairman Marshall Cohen said.    After about a half-hour discussion with debenture holdersduring the meeting, Cohen and Gulf lawyers agreed to compensatethem for about six months of interest that they would have lostunder a corporate reorganization plan taking effect July one.The holders then withdrew a proposed amendment that sought todelay the plan's closing to July 16 so they could collectinterest due to be paid July 15.    "We have not sorted out the mechanics of how we're going todo this," Cohen told reporters later.    "It may well be that in the end the principal shareholdermay absorb that interest," he said, referring to the Reichmannfamily's Olympia and York Developments Ltd, which owns about 79pct of Gulf Canada.                                     Cohensaid he wanted to ensure that Gulf Canada need not revisereorganization proposals already on file with Revenue Canadaand the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.    "If Gulf can't pay it (the interest) without upsetting theapplecart, Olympia and York will pay," he said.    The reorganization will see Gulf Canada Corp renamed GulfCanada Resources Ltd. Shareholders will be offered shares ofthree separate publicly traded companies, Gulf CanadaResources, Abitibi-Price Inc &lt;A.TO> and GW Utilities Ltd.    Newly formed GW Utilities will hold Gulf Canada's interestsin Consumers' Gas Co Ltd &lt;CGT.TO>, Hiram Walker-Gooderham andWorts Ltd and Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd &lt;IPL.TO>.    Cohen said Olympia and York's interest in Gulf CanadaResources will slip to about 68 or 69 pct as a result of apreviously announced plan to sell 450 mln dlrs of new stock.                                 In answer to a reporter's question, Cohen said there was apossibility that the size of the offering could be increased.    "There seems to be pretty strong interest," he said, but headded that much depended upon market conditions at the time ofpricing. The issue will be priced later this month, accordingto a company official.   Reuter&#3;
