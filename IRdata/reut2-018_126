Royal Bank of Canada said it classified1.3 billion dlrs in medium and long-term loans to Brazil asnon-accrual, leading to a seven pct drop in second quarterprofit.    "The designation of these loans as non-accrual reduced thebank's earnings by about 22 mln dlrs after tax," chairman AllanTaylor said in a statement. "Without this reduction,second-quarter earnings would have been about 138 mln dlrs," a10 pct increase over last year's profit, Taylor said.    The bank earlier reported second quarter profit fell to116.2 mln dlrs from 125.1 mln dlrs a year ago.    The bank said domestic earnings rose to a record 125 mlndlrs in the second quarter, a 52 mln dlr increase from the yearbefore, due to higher business volumes and securities gains aswell as a better yield from its domestic non-accrual loanportfolio.    It said international operations reported a net after-taxloss of nine mln dlrs, compared with a 52 mln dlr profit lastyear. The decline largely reflects the impact of Brazil'ssuspended interest payments, which resulted in about a 40 mlndlr reduction in net interest income, Royal Bank said.    Royal Bank said it keeping its 1987 loan loss experienceestimate unchanged from the last quarter at one billion dlrs.It said it is committed to building its general provision forloan losses to at least 20 pct of total outstanding loans totroubled sovereign borrowers by the end of 1989.    The bank said non-accrual loans totalled 3.3 billion dlrsat April 30--1.5 billion in domestic loans and 1.8 billion ininternational loans. Excluding the 1.3 billion dlrs in loans toBrazil, net non-accrual loans at the end of the second quarterdeclined 200 mln dlrs over the 1987 first quarter, it said.&#3;
