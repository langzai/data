This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting inWashington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reachedat the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada inGroup of Five (G-5) talks on management of the internationalmonetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.    It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plansto attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyoaccord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.    On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of itsG-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earliersession of talks involving G-5 members.    Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said-    "Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it tobe remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for theenlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever "themanagement or the improvement of the international monetaryeconomic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'"    Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on thegrounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubberstamping agreements already taken.    The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was "certain thatthis time incidents would not occur."    But it said it would be opportune to look in depth at therole and the procedures of G-7 in relation to those of G-5. REUTER&#3;
