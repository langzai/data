World stocks of silver are largeenough to accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equationthis year, with industrial consumption expected to again exceedmine production, the dealer house Handy and Harman said in itsannual review of the silver market.    The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supplydeficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces andproduction level of 382,000,000 ounces.    However, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000ounces at the end of 1986, it said.    The review noted that world industrial consumption has beenon an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pctbelow the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.    Handy and Harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were usedto produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985,with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U.S.coins, including the American Eagle.    It also said that in recent years Communist countries haveincreased their silver imports and estimated that China andEast Germany alone took in 70,000,000 ounces of foreign silverin the last five years.
