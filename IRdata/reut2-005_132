President Leon Febres Cordero saidEcuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to makepayments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would haveto be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.    Ecuador yesterday said last week's earthquake was forcingit to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide inworld oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreignbanks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreigndebt.    "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," thepresident said during a visit to the quake zone. "A governmentas a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."    He said he had previously held that Ecuador was obliged tomake debt payments when crude oil was at 26 dlrs a barrelbecause the government had projected plans with crude prices atthat level.    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oilwould have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be ableto meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrsa barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that. REUTER&#3;
