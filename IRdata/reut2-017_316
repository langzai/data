A leading regional banker saidthat it was axiomatic that despite market intervention, acountry's currency will eventually fall to an exchange ratewhich balances its international trade and payments accounts.    John Medlin, president and chief executive officer for theFirst Wachovia Corp, said that "substantial and rapid currencydevaluations usually are followed in time by surging priceinflation, spiralling interest rates and painful economicausterity."    Speaking to a banking trade group, he also said the peak ofdebt writeoff has not yet been reached.    Medlin told the Bankers Association for Foreign Trade thatultimately "our nation's budget and trade deficits will bebalanced either through voluntary restraints in spending andconsumption or through forced austerity imposed by adispassionate and unmerciful international market place."    He said the continuing weakness of the dollar and therecent increase in inflation and interest rates "provide earlywarning that the classic laws of international economics stillare in effect."    He also told the association that trying to reduce thetrade deficit by erecting protectionist barriers to importswould not give lasting relief.    "However, the imposition and enforcement of fair traderules could help improve imbalances with nations which practiceprotectionism and deception on us."    Medlin noted that the U.S. economy was likely to continue"at best being a sluggish mixture of depressed segments andgrowth areas."    But he said that the business cycle was still alive andthat the next downturn "could be deeper and harder to reversethan the last one." Reuter&#3;
