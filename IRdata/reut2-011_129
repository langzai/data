U.S. District Court Judge RobertSweet granted requests by federal authorities for court ordersfreezing the assets of former Merrill Lynch executive NahumVaskevitch, who has been charged with insider trading.    Acting on arguments by the Securities and ExchangeCommission, Sweet issued a preliminary injunction barringVaskevitch and other defendants in the case from committingfurther violations of U.S. securities law.    He also issued orders freezing the defendants' U.S. assets,forcing them to give a full accounting of their assets andpreventing any alteration or destruction of documents.    The orders merely extend indefinitely the effectiveness oftemporary restraining orders the SEC obtained againstVaskevitch on March 11, when it charged him with mastermindingan insider trading scheme that netted him and his associatesmore than four mln dlrs in illegal profits.    Vaskevitch, who headed the mergers and acquisitionsdepartment of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Ltd, theLondon branch of the brokerage giant, leaked inside informationabout 12 companies to his associates, the SEC charged.    Also charged were David Sofer, an Israeli, and two firms heand Vaskevitch used. All reside outside U.S. territory. Reuter&#3;
