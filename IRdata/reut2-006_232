House Budget Committee ChairmanWilliam Gray, D-Pa, said he would propose a freeze on allspending for federal government programs for the fiscal 1988budget to meet budget deficit targets.    "An outlay freeze -- with no additional revenues -- producesalmost enough savings to reach the 108 billion dlr deficittarget. For fiscal 1988, this would mean total spending of justover 1 trillion dlrs," Gray said in a statement.    Gray said his plan would call for a freeze in spending oneach individual federal program at fiscal 1987 levels.    He said this would mean numerous program cuts, lowerbenefits for recipients of federal assistance and fewer peoplebeing served by federal programs.    Gray said he would make the budget freeze proposal when theHouse Budget Committee begins work on the budget resolutionthis Thursday. The Senate Budget Committee began work on itsbudget resolution this afternoon. Reuter&#3;
