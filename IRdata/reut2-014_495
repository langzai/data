The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demandoutlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japaneseenergy demand, ministry officials said.    MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energysupplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600mln, they said.    The decision follows the emergence of structural changes inJapanese industry following the rise in the value of the yenand a decline in domestic electric power demand.    MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demandoutlook through deliberations of committee meetings of theAgency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.    They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energysupply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.    Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric powerin the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) andliquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.
