American Telephone and Telegraph Co andPhilips Telecommunications BV (APT) would hold 36 pct throughdirect and indirect holdings in France's &lt;Cie Generale deConstructions Telephoniques> if a joint bid with Frenchpartners for the soon-to-be-privatised firm succeeds, adirector at one of the partner firms said.    Marc Mathieu of &lt;Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pctfor APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT &lt;T.N.> and theNV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS>.    The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company madeup of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi &lt;MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost theirstake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject toclose discussions within the government due to legal queriesover the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministryofficial said.    Although bought by French citizens they are managed byforeign banks &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and&lt;Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled byAlgemene Bank Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.    CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephoneswitching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mlnfrancs by private tender.    Five groups are bidding for the company and the governmenthas said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.    APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference acapital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, butdeclined to give details or say how an increase would affectforeign stakes in CGCT.    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales ofthree billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.    A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committedto investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and productionplants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT toproduce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it toFrench standards.    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement forATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introductionof the French government privatisation laws which reopenedbidding among a wider range of applicants.    Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany'sSiemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> allied with Schneider SA &lt;SCHN.PA>subsidiary Jeumont-Schneider, Sweden's Telefon AB LM Ericsson&lt;ERIC.ST> allied with Matra &lt;MATR.PA> and Bouygues SA&lt;BOUY.PA>, Italy's &lt;Italtel>, and Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd&lt;NTL.TO>.
