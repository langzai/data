Argentine grain growers reducedtheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the currentharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reachbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnesestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated inmid-February.    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, accordingto official figures, and would be a new record.    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was arecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pctcompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.    The change in yield estimates is due to very hightemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year inthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe andnorthern Buenos Aires province.    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybeanpods empty, especially in Cordoba.    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, sincerainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak inBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. Therewas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields wereable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recentweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,sunflower and sorghum harvesting.    Crops were considered in generally good condition, thoughit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains ofrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of thetotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.    Total production for the current maize harvest is expectedto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mlntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pctlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,according to official figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct oftotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was twoto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    The current harvest's volume was again expected to bebetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower thanlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers fearedthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll oncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct oftotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mlnhectares planted in the previous harvest.    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvestremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mlntonnes. Reuter&#3;
