A study of salmonella poisoning hasuncovered new evidence that the common practice of feedingantibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria thatcan infect humans and resist medicines.    Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Controltracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that isresistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link theresulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promotethe growth of cattle.    Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply ofantibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics havebeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugsis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseasesthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affecthumans.    But the new study, reported in Thursday's New EnglandJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the numberof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistantinfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half thevictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalizedfor their illness.    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't alwaysprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eatingraw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, "themajority of cases appear to have been caused by eatinghamburger that was at least partially cooked."    The researchers said the results show that "food animals area major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infectionsin humans, and that these infections are associated with(antibiotic) use on farms."
