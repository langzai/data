The loopholes in Swiss banking supervisionmust be closed in a step-by-step manner, Swiss National BankVice-President Markus Lusser said.    The integration of financial markets had blurred thedistinction between banks and bank-like finance companies, andthe varying degree of regulation of the two sectors had adestablizing effect, he told the Association of Foreign Banks.    "It is in the interest of all market participants that theseinstitutes (finance companies) be brought as soon as possibleunder banking supervision," he said in remarks prepared fordelivery to the association's annual meeting.    It was important, however, that bringing finance companiesunder the banking law did not undermine Switzerland as afinancial marketplace, Lusser said.    "It is decisive for its future that it succeeds inattracting and holding a wide variety of banks, financialintermediaries and financial experts," he said.    Lusser also urged greater harmonization of regulatorypractice with other countries in view of the integration ofworld markets and the internationalization of the bankingbusiness. REUTER&#3;
