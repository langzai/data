A member of the board whichregulates the farm credit system said Congress should plan toprovide at least 800 mln dlrs in fiscal 1988 to bailout thetroubled system, but other members of the board differed.    Jim Billington, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) boardmember told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommitteehearing "I feel your subcommittee should plan on providing atleast 800 mln next year to assist the Farm Credit System."    However, FCA board member Marvin Duncan differed, saying"it is premature to talk about the cost of a solution until weknow what kind of solution."    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, said it might bepossible to structure a rescue of the system with governmentguarantees or a line of credit which requires little or noupfront government money.    However, Billington said Congress must provide helpimmediately because "this system needs some assurance that itwill get some help."    The FCA estimates the system could lose up to 1.4 billiondlrs in 1987, exhausting the remainder of its working capital,Naylor said.    The farm credit system is expected to present its ownproposals for government aid to a Senate Agriculturesubcommittee hearing on Thursday.    Naylor said the Treasury Department is continuing to refineReagan administration ideas on how a rescue should bestructured.    Congressional sources said they hope to begin drafting arescue bill for the farm credit system as early as next week. Reuter&#3;
