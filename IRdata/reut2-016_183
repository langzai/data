West German Economics Minister MartinBangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leadingeconomic research institutes for early introduction of a majortax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.    In a statement reacting to the five institutes' jointspring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call forbringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --    "The government points out that the positive effects forgrowth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budgetdeficit) must not be allowed to be endangered."    Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts plannedfor 1988 had already been increased.    Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pctgrowth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.    Bangemann said "The government, agreeing with the majority,sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate forexports expressed by the minority."    He said there was reason to believe that export demandwould start to rise in the course of the year, partly becauseof a further increase in world trade. REUTER&#3;
