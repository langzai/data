William Crowe, chairman of the U.S.Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted Iran will retaliate for theU.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranianoptions were limited.    "They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,and let me stress for you that our commitment there is notgoing to be risk free or casualty free."    He said the most likely Iranian response would involveterrorism or the laying of mines.    "They obviously will look for ways that are probably more inline with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,"Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.    He declined comment on a reporter's query whether hefavored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by thepresident.    "We carried out the operation that was decided upon and wecarried it out with enthusiasm and I think it wasprofessionally and well done," Crowe said. Reuter&#3;
