Helga Steeg, executive director ofthe International Energy Agency, said a U.S. oil import feewould disrupt world markets and could prompt trade retaliationagainst the United States.    She told the U.S. chapter of the World Energy Conference she believed "an oil import fee would be difficult to operate,would generate unacceptable economic costs and that it wouldgravely hamper and distort international trade in energy."    Steeg also said it would violate the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT) by imposing a discriminatory tariff,permitting retaliation by oil exporting countries.    Steeg praised President Reagan's opposition to a tax, whichwould be aimed at helping the U.S. oil industry. Reuter&#3;
