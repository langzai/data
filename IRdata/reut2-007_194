Deputy Assistant Treasury SecretaryJames Conrow said he was exceedingly pessimistic that Congresswill approve the Reagan administration's proposed 1988 fundingfor the multilateral development banks.    Speaking to an international development conference, Conrowsaid it appears almost certain that Congress will opt to cutspending for international programs before they cut intodomestic programs.    He said that in such an environment "foreign aid will loseand lose big."    He said that this means the multilateral development bankfunding proposal will probably not "be supported and we will getcuts."    The administration has proposed development bank funding of1.8 billion dlrs for fiscal year 1988. In addition, it isseeking about 290 mln dlrs in catch-up from funding that hadbeen reduced in prior years.    Conrow defended the record of the banks in recent years,saying that they had been rightly pressing debtor countries toreform their domestic economic policies.

He said most of the loans made by the development banks goto countries that the United States would like to see helped.    Conrow said the U.S. financial commitment to the banksallows them to substantially leverage their economic strength,by getting assistance from other countries and by borrowing inthe capital markets.
