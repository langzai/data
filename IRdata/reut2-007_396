Securities and commodityexchanges should consider establishing a mechanism for haltingtrading of equities, futures and options when there is unusualprice volatility, a top Securities and exchange, SEC, officialsaid.    Richard Ketchum, director of the SEC's division of marketregulation, said a "short, system-wide halt" of trading ofstocks, futures contracts and options on futures contractswould "let everyone get a breath" in especially volatilemarkets.    Ketchum made his remarks in connection with a FuturesIndustry Association panel discussion on stock index futuresand stock market volatility.    The SEC official did not attempt to define "volatile"markets.    Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman SusanPhillips later told reporters that exchanges already have theauthority to halt trading if an emergency is declared.    But she said Ketchum's proposal was "something to look at"and that she expected the exchanges to explore procedures formaking order imbalances public.    William Brodsky, president of the Chicago MercantileExchange, CME, told Reuters that considering Ketchum's proposalwould be a "worthwhile exercise," but that implementation of atrading halt mechanism posed "major, philosophical, economicquestions."    Ketchum said price limits on contracts "are notparticularly useful in dealing with volatility."    Earlier, Brodsky announced the CME board of directors haddecided last Tuesday to drop a plan to set a 12-point limit onthe daily price movement of its Standard &amp; Poor's 500 contract. Reuter&#3;
