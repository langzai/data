Currency fluctuations may reassert theirinfluence on the bullion market in the near future, bullionbankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.    But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in anyreactions to movements on foreign exchanges.    "OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil pricesremains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appearsthat the market should be approached cautiously," Montagu said.    The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeablelong-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and theIranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar. Reuter&#3;
