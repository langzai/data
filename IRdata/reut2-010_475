The South African Reserve Bank,confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic productin the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annualrate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pctin the 1985 final quarter.    The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominalgrowth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a1.5 pct contraction in 1985.    But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade istaken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pctcompared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.    GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by aneconomy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes suchpayments or outflows.    The bank also said there were indications the country'seconomic recovery was becoming more broadly based.    With the exception of commerce all major sectors of theeconomy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domesticproduction.    The bank said major increases in foreign reserves wererecorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987.Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.    Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the totalannual value of import payments.    The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion randin 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.    The bank said continuing strength of the current accounthas allowed foreign reserves to be "rebuilt to more comfortablelevels."    "This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lendingsupport to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were tobe called for," the bank said. REUTER&#3;
