A.H. Robins Co, facing suits over itsDalkon Shield birth control device, said a Federal Court ofAppeals approved of the way the company notified potentialvictims about a possible liability.    The notification of potential claimants, which began injanuary 1986 and ended several months later, was challenged bysome claimant committees who said the company's program wasinadequate.    A company spokesman said A.H. Robins was pleased with theruling, noting an unfavorable decision would have "set thewhole thing back for quite some time."    The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the fourthcircuit, which upheld a lower court, said, "the notificationprogram used by Robins was ... reasonable.    "The evidence indicates that every news outlet in the worldreceived the information. Simiarly, there is strong evidencethat the news was broadly disseminated worldwide.    "Women from such unlikely locations as Kenya, Botswana,Pakistan and Bangladesh ultimately filed claims. A battery ofworld health and welfare organizations also disseminated theinformation. It appears to this Court that the extensivenotification program was a success." Reuter&#3;
