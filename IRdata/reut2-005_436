The International Finance Corporationis planning to intervene to help certain developing countrycompanies to borrow on world capital markets, IFC chiefexecutive Sir William Ryrie told a news conference.    Ryrie said the IFC is at present seeking to overcomeregulatory barriers to its underwriting business on the UnitedStates and London markets.    "There are many companies in the more advanced developingcountries which are strong enough to borrow by issuing bonds orfloating rate notes," he added.    However, such companies needed help and the IFC could playa role by introducing them into the market and underwritingissues, Ryrie said.    "The capital markets would then get used to the idea ofbuying the paper of these companies," he added. "There is apotential source of development finance there which could bevery large."    He said he was confident there were enough institutionalinvestors who would be interested in taking paper in theinterests of portfolio diversification.    The IFC, whose role is to provide international financingfor private sector investments in developing nations, generallydoes this by providing pump priming finance to persuade westerncompanies to invest in third world enterprises.    However, in recent years it has set up three investmentfunds through which institutional investors can hold shares indeveloping country stock exchanges.    It announced the third such fund, one of 30 mln dlrs forinvestment on the Thai stock exchange, in December. There is a120 mln dlr South Korea fund and one of 50 mln dlrs whichinvests in a number of developing country stock exchanges. REUTER&#3;
