Lawyers for Morton Thiokol Inc askeda federal judge to unseal all papers filed in court here inconnection with a lawsuit against it by a former employee.    U.S. District Judge Harold Greene held a hearing thismorning on the company's request but took no immediate action,according to a clerk.    The company's motion was opposed by lawyers for the U.S.Department of Justice.    The lawsuit filed by the former employee, engineer RogerBoisjoly, alleged criminal responsibility by Thiokol in thedeaths of the seven Challenger astronauts in January 1986.    Justice Department sources told Reuters earlier this monththat the Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched acriminal investigation of Thiokol, which made the boosterrocket blamed for the loss of the Challenger space shuttle.    The sources said the probe stemmed from the suit byBoisjoly, who is now on medical disability.    Boisjoly is seeking damages from the company for allegedlydefaming his professional reputation by transferring him to aless important job after he testified to a presidentialcommission about the Challenger explosion.
