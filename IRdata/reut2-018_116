The stock of HF Ahmanson and Co fellsharply after analyst Robert Hottensen of Goldman Sachs and Cocut his earnings estimates of the savings and loan, traderssaid.    Ahmanson's stock fell 1-1/8 to 20-1/8 in active trading.    Hottensen was unavailable for comment, but a spokeswomanfor Goldman Sachs said the reason for the reduction in earningsestimates is the decline in demand for mortgage loans asinterest rates move higher. Mortgage rates moved to doubledigits in april for the first time since last summer.    The Goldman spokeswoman said that sales of adjustable ratemortgages was a significant factor in Hottensen's originalearnings estimates.    Last year, when the company's net income was 3.22 dlrs ashare, Ahmanson generated more than half of its 541 mln dlrs ofpretax income from gains on loan sales, the spokeswoman said.    She said the reduction in earnings estimates to 2.60 dlrs ashare in 1987 from a previous estimate of 3.30 dlrs, reflectsless optimism with the mortgage loan environment.    In the present environment for mortgages, the spokeswomansaid, Ahmanson's second quarter earnings should drop to 45 ctsa share from last year's 80 cts a share.    Hottnesen expects the savings and loan to earn between 2.90dlrs and 3.10 dlrs a share in 1988. he had previously estimatedearnings of 3.30 dlrs a share in 1988. Reuter&#3;
