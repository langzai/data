Poland met the Paris Club of westerncreditor nations for renewed talks on rescheduling its debtrepayments but no conclusive result was expected, diplomaticsources said.    They said the discussions, led on the Polish side by deputyFinance Minister Andrzej Doroscz, were to renew contacts agreedafter an inconclusive meeting in January and the talks weredescribed as a "technical meeting."    The January talks focussed on the rescheduling of about 500mln dlrs of interest and principal due by end-1986 and alsotouched upon delays in debt repayments recheduled previously.    Poland has a 33.5 billion dollar debt to western creditorcountries and commercial banks and has already indicated itwill not be able to meet interest payments this year afterfalling behind for the past two years.    "The Paris Club is demanding repayment but Poland needs newcredits and has made certain supplementary proposals, but it isup to the Club to show an initiative," one of the diplomaticsources said without elaborating.    Poland is still continuing a dialogue with theInternational Monetary Fund but this is progressing slowly, thesource said.    One diplomatic source said the key to Poland's debt problemlay in London, saying that the commercial bank creditors theremust take a practical position before a Paris Club decision.    "But their position seems to be hardening," the source said."One really cannot expect a positive conclusion to today'stalks," the source added. REUTER&#3;
