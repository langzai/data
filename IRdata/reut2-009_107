Brazil and its bank advisory committeeagreed to transmit a request for an extension of short-termcredit lines totalling 16 billion dlrs for 60 days until May31, Brazilian Central Bank President Francisco Gros said.    Speaking after talks with the committee here, Gros alsosaid he did not expect to make interest payment to the banks atthis moment.    He added that "no one should expect any dramaticdevelopments before March 31."    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short-termtrade and money market lines.    Bankers said they would relay the Brazilian request for anextension but declined to say whether they were specificallyendorsing it.    Gros said the decision, which he called a "standstill"arrangement, will be communicated to Brazil's 700 bankcreditors by telex tomorrow. Banks had been pressing Brazil tomake at least a token interest payment, but Gros said thegovernment was unable to comply for the moment.    He stressed however that Brazil was willing to pay as soonas it could, but added that a payment of interest was notconnected with the extension of the credit lines.    "That would not be wise," he said.    He said that the extension of the short-term lines wouldnot be carried out through "an official instrument" as there wasnot time to complete the legal requirements.    Gros said Brazil was likely to meet again with the 14-bankadvisory committee once Brazil had information to present on aneconomic plan. REUTER&#3;
