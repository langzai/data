LL and E Royalty Trust said LouisianaLand and Exploration Co &lt;LLX>, the working interest owner forits oil and natural gas properties, is entitled to startplacing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrueto the trust.    LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed anyamounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine thenecessity of doing so.  The trust said "If the working interestowner does begin to escrow funds, the effect on the royaltiespaid to the trust would be significant."  Royalties from theproperties are the trust's only source of income.    The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminaryannual estimates of future net revenues and the discountedpresent value of future net revenues from proved oil andnatural gas reserves attributable to properties in which thetrust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectivelyfrom those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and naturalgas prices.    It said, however, that oil and natural gas reserves haveactually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimatesreflect prices and costs only through September 30.    The trust said using the September figures, the engineersdetermined estimated future net revenues to the trust fromtotal proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingpricesreceived in January 1987, however, it said the estimate wouldhave been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there hasbeen some weakening in prices since January.    The trust said the most significant portion of the drop inestimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabamaand Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986,as prices recieved from Jay in September were near productioncosts after expenses of nitrogen injection.
