The climate for precious metals isimproving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fearsand the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets,brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.    Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms dueto a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relativeto gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. InMarch the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.    The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver ismodest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.    The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely tocontinue in the short term.    A period of consolidation might be necessary before pricesattempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long asthe dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silverwas positive.    However silver was less likely to continue to outpace theother metals by such a margin, Montagu said. REUTER&#3;
