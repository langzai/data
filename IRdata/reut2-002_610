Duff and Phelps said it has downgradedfixed income securities of USX Corp and its subsidiaries and atthe same time took the issues off its watch list.    The change affects about 6.6 billion dlrs in debtsecurities.    USX senior debt was lowered to DP-11 (high BB) from DP-9middle BBB), Marathon oil senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9,United States Steel senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9 andsubordinated debt to DP-13 (low BB) from DP-11, USX preferredstock to DP-14 (high B) from DP-12 (middle BB) and preferencestock to DP-15 (middle B) from DP-13.    The downgrades reflect substantial business risk andincreased financial risk, Duff and Phelps said.    The steel industry remains intensely competitive and majordomestic integrated producers have lost share to imports andminimills, D and P said. In oil and gas, profitability and cashflows are larger, but there is still considerable volatility.As for financial risk, USX has arranged to borrow 1 billiondlrs through a production payment of its Marathon subsidiary.Consequently a selected group of creditors has prior claim topublic debt holders for cash flows from this asset, D and Psaid.
