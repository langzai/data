Allis-Chalmers Corp said thecompany and its domestic affiliates filed voluntary petitionsfor reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal BankruptcyCode in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District ofNew York.    The company said its business units outside the UnitedStates are not affected by the action.    Allis-Chalmers said the rapid agreement was essential forits restructuring plan, announced March 4.    However, the company said, "agreement could not be workedout within the short time frame available, and it wasdetermined that the only practical alternative was to obtaincourt protection."    "This protection enables us to keep on operating ourbusiness in the ordinary course while affording us time to workout our obligations and complete our operational restructurestrategy."    Allis-Chalmers said the proposal announced in March calledfor a complete restructuring of its obligations and capitalstructure as well as major structural changes in operations.    The company said funds generated by U.S. operations arecurrently inadequate to meet its U.S. obligations, primarilydue to the carryover from discontinued and drasticallydownsized businesses.    It said funds produced by non-U.S. operations are notreadily available to help meet those obligations, which includea health care program for retirees and debt service carriedover from the larger Allis-Chalmers of earlier years.    Allis-Chalmers said its U.S. cash flow exceeded a negative24 mln dlrs in 1986 and was a negative two mln dlrs in thefirst quarter of 1987. The company has financed a portion ofits debt service and other obligations through sales of assetsand has relied on short-term waivers from its lenders toprevent defaults on principal and interest payments.    Because of Allis-Chalmers' financial position, it said, newfinancing facilities were not available outside of Chapter 11,adding substantially all U.S. assets other than inventory arepledged as security for its debts.
