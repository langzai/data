The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp&lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,share analysts polled by Reuters said.    Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last yearranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will beannounced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for aone-for-five bonus issue.    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonusissue this year, probably one for three or one for five.    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>is to report its 1986 results on Friday.    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of morethan one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to12 pct.    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrsfor a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed innerreserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of theHong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew bynearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.    "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at MansionHouse Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.    Government figures show that total loans and advances roseby 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay ofthe local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of fivepct in 1985.    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest receivedon loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank andHang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the bankingsystem, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.    The strength of the real-estate market was another majorincome source for the bank group. Loans to finance propertydevelopment and instalment mortgages rose sharply.    "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgagebusiness despite tough competition from the Bank of China groupand other foreign banks," one analyst said.    The high level of activity on the capital and equitiesmarkets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in HongkongBank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel andCo>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting asfinancial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlrflotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which HongkongBank owned 30 pct at the time.    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in returnfor 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stakein &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of twoEnglish-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and willnot show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reducedneed to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was muchlower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong LeongSecurities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said thebank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against itsshipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County SecuritiesAsia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. Sheforecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to haveimproved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrsfrom 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER&#3;
