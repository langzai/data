The company said the lessor of an NL Chemicals pigmentmaking plant in Leverkusen, West Germany, has indicated theplan, without the lessors consent, would allow the lessor to buy the plant and terminate asupplies and services agreement.    NL said it disagrees with the lessor's position and willseek its consent to the spin-off. If the lessor does notconsent, NL will pursue an alternative that will result in theseparation of its chemicals and petroleum services businesses.    NL said it believes the alternative form of the separationwould not require the lessor's consent, which would not besought. The alternative would require approval by NLshareholders and other parties, which should be attainable, itsaid.    As previously announced, NL plans to distribute shares ofNL Chemicals Inc common stock as a spin-off, through redemptionof NL's Series C preferred stock depositary receipts, when theredemption is not likely to result in significant tax liabilityto either NL or NL Chemicals.
