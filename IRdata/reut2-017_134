West German banks face disruptionfrom strike ballots and selective strikes after the breakdownof talks on wages and working hours, the German EmployeesUnion, DAG, and the Commerce, Banking and Insurance Union, HBV,said.    But the chairman of the bank employers' federation, HorstBurgard, told reporters in Frankfurt he hoped the two sideswould reach agreement after a pause for thought.    DAG chief negotiator Gerhard Renner said the employers'offer to resume talks was farcical as long as they refused toremove the issue of flexible working hours from the talks.    Both sides agreed there was now little point in top levelnegotiations similar to those held in the engineering industrywhich resolved a dispute on working hours.    Renner and HBV chief negotiator Lorenz Schwegler said theywere prepared to compromise on the issue of flexible workinghours, but this subject should not be included in the wagenegotiations for the 380,000 bank employees.    Burgard, also management board member of Deutsche Bank AG,said the employers sought acceptance of more flexible hours onan unchanged 40 hour week in the negotiations.    The employers have unilaterally imposed a 3.6 pct pay risebackdated to March 1, with the collapse of the talks. The HBVis seeking a six pct rise and DAG a 6.5 pct increase.    Schwegler said the unions would react to the collapse ofthe talks with protest and warning strikes. Union officialswould resist overtime and attempts to introduce flexible hours.    Next week the unions will set strike ballots aiming atstrikes in sensitive areas such as bank computer and boursedata centres. The unions only account for some 25 pct of bankemployees. DAG will seek support from its members in theBundesbank who are not directly affected by the negotiations. REUTER&#3;
