Central bank governor Jose Fernandez saidthe 10.3 billion dlr debt restructuring package he and FinanceSecretary Jaime Ongpin negotiated with the Philippines'commercial creditors was better than Mexico's.    "I think we got a better deal. It was really an enormousdrop, a reduction in rates and that to me is the criticalelement," he told Reuters.    He was reacting to comments by local economists who saidManila's debt accord was no better than Mexico's, which had wona 20-year repayment, including a seven-year grace last year at13/16 points over London interbank offered rates (Libor).    The Philippines clinched a repayment of 17 years, includinga grace period of 7-1/2 years on 10.3 billion dlrs of its totaldebt of 27.8 billion.    But Fernandez said what was more significant was thatManila came down from 1-7/8 on the new money and 1-5/8 on therestructured debt to 7/8 points. Mexico, on the other handdropped to 13/16 from 14/16.    "They got a 1/16 reduction. We got almost a one percentagepoint reduction," he said.    Asked why some features of the debt agreement such as thetoken prepayments of principal were not made publicimmediately, he said "These are very long documents and in apress statement you can only cover the key points. But thesewill be made available to you."    Ongpin confirmed on Tuesday that a Reuter report from NewYork that Manila will pay its commercial creditors 111 mln dlrsover 1987-1989 was accurate.    He omitted the token prepayments in previous announcementsbut said there was nothing secret about them. REUTER&#3;
