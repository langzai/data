Japan cannot bear a further rise of theyen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said.    "A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan andthe Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden," hetold reporters.    The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leadersof the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus.    Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrowfor talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertainbecause of the continuing parliamentary boycott by oppositionparties protesting plans for a new sales tax.    If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probablyhave to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions onthe government's 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said.    Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach thetrade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner.    But, he added, "If the issue of rice is to be raised...Iwould mention the feelings of the Japanese people."    Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the countrycannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports becausethe issue is too sensitive. REUTER&#3;
