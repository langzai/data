Finance Minister MohammedAli Abal-Khail said a committee will be set up to examine theproblem of late government payments to contractors andcompanies operating in the kingdom.    He told a working session on the first day of abusinessmen's conference yesterday that the committee, made upof Finance Ministry and Chamber of Commerce officials, will beformed shortly.    He said the committee will also investigate disputesbetween contractors and the government, but said the foreignpress had to some extent exaggerated payments problems.    Abal-Khail said, "It is only natural that among thosethousands of contracts some problems perpetrated by disputesover specifications, contractual obligations, project-handoversand duration of contracts arose."    Late payments, or in some cases total absence of payments,have been a major source of concern for both the Saudi privatesector and foreign contractors operating in the kingdom.    Businessmen said the minister's remarks were a rareadmission of problems in the contract sector and the firstconcrete sign of government action to tackle payments delays. REUTER&#3;
