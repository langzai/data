Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called onAmericans to pressure Congress in the fight against acid rainin what some observers said may represent a shift in Canada'slobbying strategy with the United States.    Mulroney told delegates to a North American wildlifeconference that he has not been pleased with the U.S.administration's lack of speed in acting on the question, whichCanada sees, he said, "as a test of our relationship" with theU.S.    Mulroney and President Reagan endorsed a report byspecially appointed acid rain envoys last year. Last week, theWhite  House asked Congress for 2.50 billion U.S. dlrs to fundthe acid rain fight.    Mulroney described the commitment as "significant," but notedit was a long time in coming.    "We are geared up, tanked up and raring to go," Mulroneysaid. "But I must tell you we were not happy with the pace withwhich the U.S. administration moved to implement thepresident's acceptance of the envoy report."    The prime minister urged his mostly American audience tohelp Canada take the fight to Congress, saying his governmentis determined to fight on more than one front.    "The campaign does not involve either or choices between theadministration on one hand and Capitol Hill on the other," hesaid.    The Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain hailed Mulroney's callto take the battle to Congress.    "It is clear that he has an understanding now that Congressmust be emphasized as equally as the administration," saidspokesman Michael Perley.    Reuter&#3;
