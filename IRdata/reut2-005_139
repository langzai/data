Yugoslavia's top oil and natural gasproducer &lt;Ina-Naftaplin> has started to implement a cooperationcontract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern&lt;Petro Chemie>, the official Tanjug news agency said.    Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineriesin Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in thepetrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. TheYugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France.    Tanjug said this year's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs.    Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany's Hoechst AG&lt;HFAG.F> two years ago.    Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects,involving Yugoslavia's other main producer &lt;Naftagas> of NoviSad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploringfor and exploiting oil and natural gas.    An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtainedfrom fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said.    Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia's total oilproduction, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year.    Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods andservices to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia'sleading export enterprises.    In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said ithas successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointlyprospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there.    Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would startsoon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said.
