Brazilian farmers, angry about highinterest rates, staged fresh protests yesterday in the southernstate of Rio Grande do Sul and three people died when a lorrycareered into one of the farmers' roadblocks, police said.    A series of protests involving hundreds of thousands offarmers has disrupted rural towns since January as the growersblockade roads and bank offices with farm machinery.    The Estado de Sao Paulo news agency said about 300,000 ofthe 500,000 small farmers in Rio Grande do Sul took part inyesterday's protests. The state is a leading producer of grainsand soybeans.    The Estado de Sao Paulo agency quoted Finance MinisterDilson Funaro as saying the government was very concerned aboutthe farmers' situation and particularly about their creditproblems.    The government provides limited cheap credits at 10 pctannual interest, but farmers are repaying bank loans at morethan 400 pct since the recent surge in inflation.    Brazilian press reports say financial pressures have drivensome farmers to suicide in recent weeks. REUTER&#3;
