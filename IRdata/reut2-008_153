The entire British Petroleum Co PLCrefinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut downfollowing the explosion and fire that severely damaged thehydrocracker at the site, a refinery spokesman said.    He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinerywas closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen themain units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said.    But there was extensive damage to the central part of the32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products togasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.    The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as aresult of the explosion as it will be able to bring in productfrom other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam,a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpdplant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.    He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker waskilled, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.    The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half ofits capacity since the end of January while an extensiveoverhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex wherethe hydrocracker is sited, he said.    This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, butthis is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.    Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flareline at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesmansaid this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident. REUTER&#3;
