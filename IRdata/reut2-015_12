Demand for shares in state-owned enginemaker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> is expected to be substantial when thegovernment privatises it at the end of April, Christopher Clarkof the group's bankers Samuel Montagu and Sons Ltd said.    He told a press conference after the release of an initialprospectus for the float that the issue would be offered toU.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public.    As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would bemade if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations.    He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyondsaying that a "significant proportion" would go to institutions.    A decision on what percentage would go to each sector wouldbe made shortly before the sale price was announced on April28.    Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with paymentin two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previousprivatisations.    Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rollswas a stock that should be left to the institutions. He notedthat although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls hadseveral operations -- such as spare parts and militaryequipment -- that evened out the swings.    Rolls' 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to varyaccording to changes in turnover.    He noted that net research and development expenditure waswritten off in the year it occurred, a policy that received"inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagantforecasts of future profits." He made no forecast himself.    In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion. Reuter&#3;
