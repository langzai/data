The U.S. Agriculture Department hasnarrowed by three cents the price differential between theLouisiana Gulf price of corn and posted country prices peggedto the gulf price, USDA officials said.    The change, effective April 27, means posted county priceswill be three cents higher in the region, Robert Sindt,assistant deputy administrator of USDA's AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, said.    Trade sources said USDA adjusted the differentials becausegulf prices had shown some weakness in recent days comparedwith the rest of the country.    Sindt said Louisiana Gulf corn price differentials that hadbeen between four and eight cents would, effective Monday,range between one and five cents.    Trade sources said cash bids at the Louisiana Gulf havebeen between three and 4.5 cents weaker than in the rest of thecountry in recent days, and that USDA's move would strengthenthe front end of the corn market.
