A senior Ivory Coast AgricultureMinistry official confirmed his country's backing for a newinternational cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would bepresent at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.    The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture MinisterDenis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convenedby the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London onMonday.    While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeralceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President FelixHouphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capitalYamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates willbe present throughout the London talks, the official said.    Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours thathe or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of publicmourning in the West African nation helped depress already lowworld cocoa prices Friday.    The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the newpact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of theworld's cocoa exporters and consumers.    He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCOCouncil chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March27.    The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of thepact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a markethit by successive world cocoa surpluses.    Ivory Coast did not participate in the last internationalcocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparkedhopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices. REUTER&#3;
