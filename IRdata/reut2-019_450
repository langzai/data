The World Bank is prepared to play amore aggressive role in promoting Third World development andeasing the debt crisis, bank president Barber Conable said.    "We must be realistic about the immediate prospects for anexpansion in voluntary commercial bank lending, with the WorldBank playing an even more vigorous role in the debt crisis,"Conable said in an interview with Newsweek magazine.    Conable said the bank must step in to help relieve the debtcrisis, which has prompted a number of U.S. Commercial banks towrite off a portion of their Third World loans.    "Our plans include initiatives on the debt front, as well asgreater emphasis on debt-equity swaps and the promotion ofprivate investment in Third World countries through ouraffiliate, the International Finance Corporation," Conable said."The bank is primarily a development institution, not adebt-management agency. But debt must be managed effectively orit hampers development."    Conable defended his reorganisation plan for the bank,which he said was aimed at improving efficiency and limitingbureaucracy. He added environmental considerations would play alarger role in the evaluation of proposed projects. REUTER&#3;
