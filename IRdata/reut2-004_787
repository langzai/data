Duff and Phelps said it changed theratings on outstanding senior debt of Baker International Corpand Hughes Tool Company.    The change affects 515 mln dlrs in debt and assumes amerger of the two companies will be completed.    Baker's senior debt was downgraded to DP-8 (high BBB) fromDP-7 (low A).    Hughes senior debt was raised to DP-8 from DP-12 (middleBB) while subordinated debt was raised to DP-9 (middle BBB)from DP-14 (high B).    The debt ratio of the combined compaies will be about 40pct but available cash plus proceeds from the sale of assetswill permit a prompt reduction in debt, Duff and Phelps said.    However, fixed charge coverages will remain very thin untilthe company's markets improve, D and P said. Reuter&#3;
