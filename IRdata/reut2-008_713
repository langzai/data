Moody's Investors Service Inc said itaffirmed the ratings on 12 billion dlrs of debt of ChryslerCorp and its unit, Chrysler Financial Corp.    The agency cited potential benefits of Chrysler's proposedacquisition of American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> to its businessposition and marketing and distribution capabilities.    Moody's said it believes the acquisition will be carriedout substantially as currently structured. Affirmed wereChrysler's Baa-1 senior debt and Chrysler Financial's Baa-1senior debt, Baa-2 senior subordinated debt and Baa-3 juniorsubordinated debt.    Also affirmed were the Prime-2 commercial paper ofChrysler's finance arm and the Baa-1 guaranteed Eurobonds ofChrysler Credit Canada Ltd.    Moody's pointed out the purchase of AMC would undercut someof the recent progress Chrysler has made in improving itsfinancial condition and cost structure. The agency noted thatChrysler would assume substantial debt and unfunded pensionliabilities, as well as two inefficient production facilities.    But, Moody's said, the negative effect on Chrysler'sprofitability and cash flow would be temporary. Meanwhile,AMC's B-1 preferred stock remains under Moody's review. Reuter&#3;
