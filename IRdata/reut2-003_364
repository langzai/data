President Reagan signed an order allowing sales of U.S. nuclear fuel to the European AtomicEnergy Community (EURATOM) to continue for a further year, eventhough they do not comply with a 1978 U.S. law.    Under the law, which is designed to combat the spread ofnuclear weapons, foreign importers of U.S. nuclear fuel mustget American consent to any reprocessing.    The United States and EURATOM have had a series of 11rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclearcooperation agreements, signed more than 20 years ago, toconform with the 1978 law.    Since 1978 the U.S.-EURATOM nuclear coooperation accordshave been extended by a series of presidential waiver orders.    State Department officials said negotiations had made moreprogress in the last two years after the United States hadoffered a longterm reprocessing consent arrangement, ratherthan requiring EURATOM to have U.S. consent for each fueldelivery.     In notifying Congress of today's order extendingU.S.-EURATOM nuclear cooperation, Reagan said: "A disruption ofnuclear cooperation would not only eliminate any chance ofprogress in our talks with EURATOM related to our agreements,it would also cause serious problems in our relationships."      He said further progress in talks with EURATOM was expected this year. Reuter&#3;
