A new steel quota system that wouldstrictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industrycould be forced on producers if they fail to find their ownsolution quickly, officials said.    EC industry ministers meeting here considered two keyproposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mlntonnes by 1990.    The first would limit the current quota system, which hasprotected EC output for seven years, only to flat products andheavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel productsinto free market competition.    The second proposal would link continuation of a quotasystem with progress toward plant closures, although less thana month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said theyhad abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.    The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solutionimmediately, instead urging steel producers to try again toreach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.    The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailedproposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and ECindustry ministers meet again in September to reach a finaldecision. Reuter&#3;
