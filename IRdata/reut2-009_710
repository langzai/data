The Italian Treasury said it would offeran undetermined amount of 10-year variable-coupon certificates(CCTs) at a rate unchanged on that of the preceding offer inlate February.    The Treasury said that, unlike the previous offer, theamount had not been prefixed. It would be in line with marketdemand unless this was considered excessive.    The CCTs will be priced at 99.00 pct for an effective netannual yield on the first coupon, payable April 1, 1988, of9.85 pct.    Subsequent yields on the certificates will be calculated byadding 0.75 point to average rates on short-term Treasurybills.    Subscriptions to the issue open April 1 and are scheduledto close April 7.    The Treasury said it reserved the right to close the issueearly. REUTER&#3;
