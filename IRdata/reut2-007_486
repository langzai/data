Japanese customs, faced with a flood offake Reebok sneakers from South Korea, have turned away some100,000 pairs since last summer, Rebook officials said.    A Ministry of Finance spokesman said officials at the portsof Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama and Kobe had begun barringcounterfeit footwear but declined to say how many pairs.    A spokesman for Reebok Japan, the local subsidiary ofReebok International &lt;RBK> of Avon, Massachussetts, said thefirm had complained of the influx to the Ministry last July.    "They use our trademark and everything. And it's easy tofake our trademark," the Reebok spokesman said.    He said customs had sent back some 100,000 pairs to SouthKorea, but the Finance Ministry declined to confirm this.    "Because of various reasons, we cannot say how many pairshave been turned away," the ministry spokesman said.    The Reebok spokesman said an unspecified number of fakeReeboks have made it into the country, and were being sold atcut-rate prices in Tokyo and Osaka stores.    "They go for about 20 to 30 pct less than the price ofgenuine Reeboks," the spokesman said. A pair of real Reebokssells for about 10,000 yen in Japan.    The government last summer warned stores not to carry theshoes and Reebok has sued two for continuing to sell them, hesaid. No action has been taken against the South Koreanmanufacturers, he said.    Reebok has also found counterfeits from Taiwan and thePhilippines aimed at the U.S. Market and fakes from Spaintargetted at European markets, he said. REUTER&#3;
