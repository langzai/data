The United States responded to anapparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continuedassurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf wouldplay purely a deterrent role.    "I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, thatwe're going to be assuring safety for American shipping andthat that shipping is not related to the war itself," StateDepartment spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.    He was asked about Iranian claims that the United Stateswas moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.    Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar HashemiRafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,"At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink ofan armed encounter with us.    "We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. Weare determined to stand firm and will certainly win."    The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up itsGulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending therefurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside thestrategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.    The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oiltankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flagand gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.    Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said, "We won't have any comment or response tothe Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear aboutthe status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the warwith no winners and no losers and any activities or statementsthat tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are nothelpful or welcome."    Redman said he could not independently confirm reports thatIran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping. Reuter&#3;
