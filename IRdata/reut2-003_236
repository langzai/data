&lt;MTS Acquisition Corp's>28-dlr-per-share offering price for Caesars World Inc isthought to be much too low and is likely to attract othersuitors for the hotel/casino company, industry analysts said.    "I think someone else will probably come in, or they (MTS)will have to raise their bid," said Marvin Roffman, an analystat Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.    MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World'slargest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own.    "I think the offer is too low by at least five points,"said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of"one of the finest casinos in the world."    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct ofCaesars World's 30.3 mln shares.    Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shareswere trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8.    A Caesars World spokesman said the company was decliningcomment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars mayissue a public statement after it has studied the offer.    Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growthpotential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of twodlrs per share.    Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoonresorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controlsCaesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City,N.J., casino hotel.    For its fiscal year ended July 31 Caesars World reportednet income of 41 mln dlrs, or 1.36 dlrs per primary share.    The company reported second quarter net income of 12.6 mlndlrs, or 41 cts per share, compared with income of 7.5 mlndlrs, or 25 cts per share a year earlier.    Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, saidthat although Sosnoff's relatively low bid may attract othersuitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars, there islittle likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle forthe company.&#3;
