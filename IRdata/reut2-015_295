Williams Cos said it expected oil andfertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but saidoperating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr specialcharge was incurred.    Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipelinefrom service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams hada net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billiondlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46billion in 1985.    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest PipelineCorp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that areamong the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gasreserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feetin 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which hasless take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, shouldshow improvement in its 1987 operating results because ofchanges tariff and federal tax rates.    The company's gas marketing business is expected to havesomewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in itsoperating region, the annual report said. The gas marketingunit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in itsdebt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mlndlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co andproceeds from the sale and leaseback of WilliamsTelecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will notbe profitable until late 1988, Williams said. Reuter&#3;
