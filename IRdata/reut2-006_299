&lt;John Labatt Ltd> is consideringexpansion in Europe, but has made no decisions as to strategy,according to spokesman I.C. Ferrier.    The company opened a London office about six months ago,and "we are prepared to invest in that area to see how one mightdo business over there," he said.    But the company has not decided whether it might openbreweries, buy a European company or whether European expansionis feasible at all, he added.
