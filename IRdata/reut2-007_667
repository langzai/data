General Electric Co said itsresearchers will investigate the potential of a gas turbinepowered by the combustion gases of burning coal.    The company said the research is part of a five-year, 19.1mln dlr program supported by the U.S. Energy Department'sMorgantown Energy Technology Center. The center is expected toput up 15 mln dlrs of the cost while GE contributes equipmentand services valued at 2.0 mln dlrs, New York State contributes1.1 mln dlrs and Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> adding 1.0 mlndlrs.    Rather than using the conventional gas turbine fuels,distillate oil or natural gas, GE said, the program will lookat the feasability of powering a turbine with coal/water slurry-- a mixture of water and finely ground coal particles fromwhich most of the ash has been removed.    Besides using a cheaper fuel, the company said, such asystem would also be less expensive to build than conventionalcoal plants which require a boiler in which coal heats water tomake steam to drive a turbine or a coal gasifier which convertsto coal into gas, which is then burned to power a turbine.
