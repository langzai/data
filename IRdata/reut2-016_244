CECOS International Inc, asubsidiary of Browning-Ferris Industries Inc, said it expectsthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sue the company,claiming non-compliance with regulatory requirements at CECOS'Livingston, Louisiana hazardous waste treatment plant.    CECOS said the EPA advised the company it intendend to seeka penalty in the range of five mln dlrs to 10 mln dlrs.    CECOS said it considered the proposed penalty to be "grosslyexcessive" and has offered 125,000 dlrs in earlier negotiationsto settle the disputed issues.    CECOS said it believes strongly that the EPA's claims andproposed remedies concerning the Livingston waste disposal siteare unreasonable.    The company also said its 125,000 dlr settlement offer wasconsistent with monetary penalties previously accepted by theEPA concerning disputes over other hazardous waste treatment,storage and disposal operations.    CECOS said major issues of the dispute include theLivingston waste site's analysis and operation plans,inspection records and freeboard limits of rainwawater holdingimpoundments. Reuter&#3;
