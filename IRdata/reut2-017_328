The Supreme Court refused to dismissa Justice Department civil suit charging Archer Daniels MidlandCo, ADM, and Nabisco Brands Inc with violating the antitrustlaws.    The high court let stand lower court rulings that rejectedthe motion by the two companies seeking dismissal of the suit.    The suit challenged the 1982 agreement by Nabisco to leaseboth of its high fructose corn syrup, HFCS, plants to ADM.    The department said that before 1982 ADM was the secondlargest U.S. producer of HFCS while Nabisco ranked third. Thedeal made ADM the nation's largest producer. Reuter&#3;
