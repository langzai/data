Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsoncriticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, whenhe was reported as saying he wanted sterling to stay roughlywhere it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60dlrs to the pound.    Holding up a newspaper report on his comments headed"Exchange Rate Targets Set" Lawson told journalists "This story isa complete non-event."    He criticised the report, which said he was now targettingsterling against the dollar and mark. "Nothing of the sortoccurred," Lawson said.    Lawson said he had only told National Economic DevelopmentCouncil panel members what the pound's current dollar/markrates were that day, after saying he was happy with currentsterling levels. He said he had told the NEDC, a tripartiteforum of government, unions and industry, that the pound wouldbe kept near its present level by a mixture of interest ratesand intervention on foreign exchange markets.    He then repeated to the panel that he remained satisfedwith sterling at around its current levels following the Parisaccord in February on currency stabilisation. REUTER&#3;
