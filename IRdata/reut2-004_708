Long delays at the railway crossing onthe Kenyan border have led Uganda to re-route its coffeeexports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumuacross Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.    Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port ofMombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external tradebut there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.    Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two tothree at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railwaysofficial said. "Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the tradeand all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu," he said.    However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry whichplies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causingbottlenecks on the lake route too.    Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reporteddelays in coffee export shipments last January due tocongestion on the lake ferries.    Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda's exportearnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni orderedall coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoidthe higher costs of road haulage.
