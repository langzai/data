Argentina expects to reach agreement withits commercial bank creditors in the near future on a newfinancing package including 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans,Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn said.    Addressing Argentine businessman during the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IADB) meeting here, he said the two sideswill meet again next Thursday in New York.    "We have made significant progress over the last 30 daysand we should have an agreement in a shorter lapse of time thanmanaged by Mexico, Venezuela or Chile," he said.    Brodersohn reiterated that Argentina's goal is to reach anagreement which permits four pct growth this year, followinglast year's 5.5 pct and negative growth in 1985.    He said discussions were still continuing ondebt-capitalization plans and schemes for on-lending, in thelight of certain Argentine concerns.    The government is anxious that debt that is capitalizedshould represent new investment in the country on a dollarinvested per dollar capitalized basis, rather than a simpletransfer of ownership of the debt, he said.    At the same time, it wants to avoid an expansionarymonetary impact from on-lending schemes, whereby debtrepayments are recycled by banks into new loans.    Brodersohn said also agreement was close on the proposalfor so-called exit bonds, whereby creditors can sell out theirdebt.    Argentina's 1987 financing needs come to 3.53 billion dlrs,including the 2.15 billion from banks and a 1.38 billion dlrIMF loan already agreed. It is projecting a current accountdeficit of 2.2 billion dlrs after one of 2.4 billion last year.    It estimates export earnings will have dropped by 7.1billion dlrs between 1985-87 as a result of falling commodityprices.    Argentina, owing 50 billion dlrs, is Latin America's fourthbiggest debtor.
