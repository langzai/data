Brazilian President Jose Sarneyannounced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase ofU.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed atpromoting imports of foreign goods.    In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for thepurchase of goods."    The parallel market, although officially tolerated, istechnically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar inthe parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct abovethe official rate.    Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machineryand industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in theparallel market without having to wait for an official orderfrom the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in aneffort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviatethe risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of theeconomy.    The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council(CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil'strade policy, with participation of the private sector.    The Council had been closed three years ago by the militarygovernment of former President Joao Figueiredo. Reuter&#3;
