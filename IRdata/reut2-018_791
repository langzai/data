The West Texas cotton crop was largelyunscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last nightthat packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather expertssaid.    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainlynothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extensionagronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far WestTexas.    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the NewYork cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25cents.    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, andwhen that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, asenior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, whichproduces about 80 pct of that state's crop.    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricaneforce. But they were isolated to just a small portion of theWest Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in Julyor August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have beenworse," Mohler said.    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has beenplanted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend ifweather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavierthan normal rainfall for several weeks, he said. Reuter&#3;
