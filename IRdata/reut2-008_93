U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakeragain said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Parislast month did not establish a target exchange rate for thedollar.    Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday:"We don't have a target for the dollar." He declined to commenton what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: "Wereally don't talk about the dollar."    He said protectionism was becoming "extremely strong" in theU.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and importbarriers in other countries.    "The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It'sextremely strong," he said.    "As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engagedhere in a real struggle to preserve the world's free tradingsystem, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.)goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same paththat the world did in the late 1930s," he said.    While relative exchange rates had a role to play indefusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offerany solution, he said.    "You must address this problem on the exchange rate side,but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It'sfar more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution ofit requires a comprehensive approach," Baker said in theinterview.    Baker said it would be necessary for other countries toadjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove theirbarriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name anycountries. REUTER&#3;
