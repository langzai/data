A Taiwan mission plans to buy 410,000bales (500 lbs/bale) of U.S. Cotton worth about 110 mln U.S.Dlrs when it visits several U.S. States early next month, aspokesman for the Taiwan Spinners Association told Reuters.    He said a similar mission last year bought 700,000 balesworth 77 mln dlrs.    He said the mission was buying less U.S. Cotton because theprice is some 15 pct higher than that of cotton from Pakistanand India. The current average price of U.S. Cotton is 75cents/lb, but the spokesman estimated the average price will be53 cents when the shipments are made next year. REUTER&#3;
