Unfavorable late winter weatherconditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslaviaindicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.    The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade toSubotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crophad been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spellthat followed a period of warm weather.    He said unseasonably warm weather in late February thatbrought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early wasfollowed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.    Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of whichshow stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leafand possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.    The report said that since much of the early growth inFebruary was from late seeding rather than from normaldevelopment, his view was that the damage may be more extensivethan some local observers say.    The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fieldson normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin andchances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.    However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorableand many of the fields had already been top-dressed, whichwould aid recovery. Reuter&#3;
