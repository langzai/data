Panama Canal toll charges will not risein the year to end-September 1988, despite last October'slandslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into thewaterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said.    He told a press conference that in confirming theCommission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.    The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss inthe current financial year but this could be carried over andmet from next year's revenues.    This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which costthe canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This includedeight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest beingspent on earth-moving operations to prevent any furtherlandslides.    He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation andhe described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was anythreat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.    Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillardcut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, addingthat he expected the canal board to determine whether and whenthe canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.
