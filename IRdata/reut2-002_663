Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS>chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increasein net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 wasencouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.    Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the releaseof ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreignearnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,notably in the securities business.    He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.    News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's shareprice on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.    Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely thefuture trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates andABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.    Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earningsmargins via traditional lending activities, he said.    Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing riskprovisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overlyconcerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factorwhich brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bankstocks recently.    He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financiallytroubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were LatinAmerican countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.    He added that losses incurred through loans to tinproducers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 hadbeen written off. REUTER&#3;
