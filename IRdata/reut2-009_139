The Food Department will no longerimport sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food andCooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters.    They said the decision was taken after the Sugar ImportersAssociation asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.    "The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will nolonger hold a buffer stock," a senior official said.    He said the government has finalised an agreement withE.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a bufferstock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department.    Officials said the size of the buffer stock has beenreduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.    The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such astrigger pricing mechanisms, they said.    Four months ago the Department allowed the private sectorto import sugar without government clearance. The Departmentand the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes ofsugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.    An Importers Association official said that "even if theDepartment no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarilybuy more."    This is because the Association would still have to competewith the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said.    The CWE is a semi-government body and the official saidarrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holdersof food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, startingApril 1.    Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar orbuy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. Forthe past two years. REUTER&#3;
