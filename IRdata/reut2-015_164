The basic deposit on cocoa futurescontracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10,taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stgfrom 400 previously, a spokesman for the InternationalCommodity Clearing House (ICCH) said.    The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.    The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations overa period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stabilityhad warranted a cut in deposit rates.    The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH afterconsultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, thespokesman said.    The cuts were likely to attract more business to themarket, he said.
