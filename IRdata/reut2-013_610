Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said that debtor nations have made much progress inlaying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution toworld debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on newfinancing.    "There is clearly a danger that adequate financingarrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in atimely way," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.    The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed withconfidence that the necessary funds will be available to them,he said.    Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading worldeconomic power, but it is in a difficult position today,Volcker said.    He said it will take a concerted effort to regularizeBrazil's external payments.    "The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilianauthorities," he said.    Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive towork together, Volcker said.    Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it wascritically important that markets be kept open by theindustrial nations.    In addition, the United States must reduce its budgetdeficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to theirdomestic economies, Volcker said.    "We need time for those actions and the earlierdepreciation to work their effects," he said. Reuter&#3;
