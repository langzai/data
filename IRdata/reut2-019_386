One of several investor groupsformerly associated with London investor Christopher Moran inhis unsuccessful bid to take over Zondervan Corp last year,said it cut its stake in the company to less than five pct.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,the group, led by investors Lawrence Altschul and JamesApostolakis, said it cut its Zondervan stake to 157,500 shares,or 3.8 pct of the total, from 246,500 shares, or 5.9 pct.    The group, which earlier this month said in an SEC filingit wanted join with other groups to maximize share values, saidit sold 89,000 shares between June 9 and 15 for 1.5 mln dlrs.    The group had joined with the Moran group, which last yearassembled a combined 44 pct stake in Zondervan during itsunsuccessful takeover try.    Last month, the Moran group broke up and splintered intovarious factions. Moran himself withdrew from the takeovereffort and last reported his personal stake at 4.8 pct.    A group led by Miwok Capital Corp, a California broker witha 10.6 pct stake, and another one led by Minneapolisstockbroker Jeffrey Wendel with 2.6 pct, have both made recentSEC filings saying they are seeking agreements with otherparties who may want to seek control of the company.
