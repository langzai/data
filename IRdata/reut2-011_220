CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issuedshares, it said in a statement.    The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar sharecapital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closingmarket level of 1.85 dlrs a share.    CSR said it will announce further details of the offersoon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for PioneerSugar stock.    It said the offer is generous since it will give PioneerSugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's netearnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct overyesterday's market price which CSR said it believed alreadycontained an element of takeover speculation.    It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's lastreported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.    CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savingswhich will flow from integrated management of CSR's andPioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.    These economies can only be achieved through CSR controland management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.
