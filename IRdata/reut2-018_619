Bell and Howell Co, in remarks preparedfor delivery to the New York Society of Security Analysts, saidit expects per-share earnings to grow in the 12-to-15 pct rangein the next three to four years.    President Gerald Schultz said the growth is without stockbuybacks and tax law changes. He said the gain is expected off1986 per-share earnings of 1.89 dlrs, calculated to excludeDeVry Inc &lt;DVRY.O> operations and non-recurring gains totaling45 cts a share.    The company said its decision to sell the DeVry business toKeller Graduate School of Management Inc will provide Bell andHowell with a non-recurring gain of more than 4.00 dlrs a sharein the third quarter and about 80 mln dlrs in additional cash.    "We will use proceeds of the transaction to repurchasestock (probably at least 10 pct) and for other purposes, suchas reducing debt" Chairman Donald Frey told analysts.    Bell and Howell said it will invest 16 mln dlrs this yearin electronic product development and introduction.    It said a stepped-up investment in its IDB2000 electronicstorage system, which uses optical disks, will result in a 5.0mln dlr loss for the product line, similar to last year. But itsaid "the swing to profitability in 1988 for this product willbe significant."    Currently, Bell and Howell is marketing the IDB2000 only toGeneral Motors Corp &lt;GM> dealers. Reuter&#3;
