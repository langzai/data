Belgian Prime Minister WilfriedMartens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.    He said this will enable the requirement to be held to419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.    Martens said following a lowering of government estimatesof 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by governmentdepartments of 1987 spending, the government calculated thatunless action was taken, the requirement would exceed thetarget by 22.5 billion francs.    Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receiptsby 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised throughtreasury operations.    Martens said the money is being found through a series ofsmall economies and confirmed that it includes the raising oftwo billion francs through the sale of part of the government's50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.    Last year, the government announced a major programdesigned to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.    The program was designed to get Belgium out of what thegovernment said was a "snowball effect" under which thegovernment constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficitswhich were due largely to the cost of servicing and repayingexisting debt.    In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimatedat 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP. REUTER&#3;
