U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oilplatform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided asecond oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missileattack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinbergerwarned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the militaryescalation between the two countries continued in the volatilewaterway.    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform byfour U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shellsat the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the centralGulf.    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranianoil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radarand communications equipment before leaving the structure, thePentagon said.     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reportersthat the second platform had been abandoned by Iranianpersonnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.    The United States said both platforms were being used tokeep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboatattacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards. Reuter&#3;
