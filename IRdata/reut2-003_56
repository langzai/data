Export-Import Bank of Japan presidentTakashi Tanaka told Brazil the bank will continue to cooperatewith it, but he refrained from making any commitment to a newcredit, Ex-Im officials said.    In a 30-minute meeting, Tanaka told Brazilian FinanceMinister Dilson Funaro the bank would consider his country'srequest for a 300 mln dlr credit in the context ofinternational cooperation, the officials said.    They said this meant the Ex-Im Bank would grant the creditas part of a package with money from the International MonetaryFund and private banks.    Brazil has resisted going to the IMF for help because itfears that the Fund will ask for changes in its economicpolicies that will throw it into recession.    Brazil first requested the 300 mln dlr credit lastNovember, to help it develop the sale and generation ofelectric power. Funaro renewed the request today. REUTER&#3;
