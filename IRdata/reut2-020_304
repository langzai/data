Monday's internationalshare crash was exaggerated and did not reflect economicfundamentals, Wolfgang Roeller, president of the West Germanbanking association BDB said in a statement.    "A comparison with the (Wall Street crash of) 1929 istotally inappropriate," Roeller, also chief executive ofDresdner Bank AG, said.    The world economy was growing and dangers of inflation werebeing held in check. The recent International Monetary Fund andWorld meetings confirmed the positive forecasts for globaleconomic development.    Therefore, there were no rational reasons for a sharptightening of monetary policy nor for a continued rise ininterest rates, Roeller said.    "This applies in particular to West Germany," he said.    As a result, Roeller expected the markets to calm. Theywould not ignore long-term economic factors.    International cooperation on currencies established by theLouvre accord and strengthened by Monday's meeting between U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker, West German Finance MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl,would stand the test, he added.
