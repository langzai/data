France's 1986 budget deficit has beenrevised down to 141.1 billion francs from the estimate at theend of last year of 143.6 billion, the Finance Ministry said.    This compares with the 1985 budget deficit of 153.3 billionfrancs and the deficit target for this year of 129 billion.    The ministry said it was the first time since 1980 that thefinal budget deficit had been below the initial target.    The budget deficit corresponded to 2.87 pct of the grossdomestic product (GDP), down from 3.35 pct in 1985.    This year the government is aiming to cut the budgetdeficit to 2.5 pct, reducing it further to two pct in 1988.    Expenditure totalled 1,228 billion francs last year, up 6.1pct from 1985, while receipts rose 7.3 pct to 1,076 billion.    The 1986 budget deficit excludes IMF credits and activitiesof the exchange stabilisation fund, but takes account of a fourbillion franc payment to the public debt depreciation fund fromincome from the privatisation programme.    The ministry also said that the 1986 expenditure totalincluded the integration into the general budget of Treasuryloans to the steel industry, which had a neutral impact on thedeficit but boosted the spending figure.
