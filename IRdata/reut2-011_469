The U.S. Agriculture Department willbe forced to close 13 foreign posts and reduce personnel infive others unless Congress approves two mln dlrs insupplemental appropriations for fiscal 1987 to cover increasedoverseas costs due to changes in the value of currencies, asenior department official said.    Thomas Kay, administrator of USDA's Foreign AgriculturalService, FAS, told the Senate Appropriations AgricultureSubcommittee that the devaluation of the U.S. dollar since 1985has raised USDA's costs in many of its 75 offices overseas.    Kay declined to say which posts were jeopardized by risingforeign costs.    In Europe and Japan, the dollar's decline is expected toraise the costs of running offices staffed by agriculturalattaches and trade officers by 2.5 mln dlrs in the currentfiscal year compared with 1985 estimates, according to FASprojections.    Favorable exchange rate changes are expected to cut FASspending by about 510,000 dlrs elsewhere, FAS said.    The House Appropriations Committee has approved one mlndlrs in supplemental funds to cover FAS losses. The full Housemay take up the measure, folded into a government-widesupplemental appropriations bill, next week.    Staff on the House panel said the committee balked atappropriating two mln dlrs because the White House budgetoffice turned down FAS's request for the supplemental. Reuter&#3;
