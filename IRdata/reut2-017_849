The dispute involved questions of contractualinterpretation arising from a 1983 agreement between thecompanies, the prospectus said.    Under question was how much software information the firmswere obliged to disclose to each other. The case had beenbefore the American Arbitration Association (AAA) since 1985.    "By subsequent agreements, the parties have resolved some ofthe issues and have established procedures to resolve presentlyoutstanding disputes with the involvement of the members of thepanel of arbitrators," the prospectus said.    "The Company is not in a position to predict with certaintythe outcome of this process and its effect on the futureresults or operations, financial or otherwise, of the Group," itsaid.    A Fujitsu spokeswoman declined to comment on theprospectus, noting the dispute remained under arbitration bythe AAA. An IBM spokesman here also declined comment.    Last November the AAA ordered both companies to maintainthe confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings and saidthat both Fujitsu and IBM had agreed that no additional commenton the subject be made.    Late last year, IBM and Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> said they hadagreed to revise a separate 1983 agreement which arose out ofsoftware disputes similar to those between Fujitsu and IBM. REUTER&#3;
