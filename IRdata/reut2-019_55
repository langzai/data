The Tokyo stock market will probably notmake significant gains next week and may suffer a temporarycorrection, brokers said.    Dashed hopes of a further cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discountrate cut and a growing conviction the dollar will remain firmagainst the yen in the near-term has created a measure ofuncertainty over the market's future, brokers said.    "Everybody is just trying to think through things and seeexactly what is going on," said a broker at Sanyo Securities CoLtd. "There is a lot of confusion," he added.    This uncertainty was spotlighted by violent swings in stockprices over the last two days. Today the 225-share averageended 462.43 points lower at 25,288.12.    "People expect a correction next week. They don't care ifthe market falls to 24,000," the Sanyo broker said. "There isalways enough money waiting to get into the market to fill anycorrection."    Tokyo stock prices owe a major part of their two-year bullrun to repeated cuts in the discount rate, which diverts moneyfrom bank deposits to the stock market and cuts the cost ofborrowing, boosting domestic demand and imports.    "Fund managers are restructuring their investment portfoliosto sell domestic-related issues and include a few moreexporters," said Prudential Bache Securities' Hank Sawa.    Tokyo-based foreign exchange dealers predict the dollar isunlikely to fall sharply in the near term, thus convincingstock market investors to buy electronics, precisioninstrument, machinery and some other export-orientedmanufacturing shares, brokers said.    "Some people are awaiting the results of proposedprotectionist U.S. Trade legislation in July for clues to thecurrency direction," a broker at Daiwa Securities Co Ltd said. REUTER&#3;
