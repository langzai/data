The Senate Budget Committee, at itsfirst budget drafting meeting of the year, discarded PresidentReagan's economic assumptions upon which he claims his budgetwould show a 108 billion dlr deficit.    In its place, the committee agreed to accept the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic assumptionsin its deliberations for drafting a 1988 budget.    The CBO says Reagan's budget--even if it were adoptedwithout change --would show a 134.4 billion dlr deficit infiscal 1988 and thereby miss the Gramm-Rudman budget law targetof 108 billion dlrs.
