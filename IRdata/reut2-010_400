A new Rabobank mortgage bond, whoseterms dealers considered extremely generous, was in heavydemand on the Amsterdam bourse today, bond dealers said.    Rabobank, not anticipating a strong two-day rally in Dutchbonds, on Wednesday set an issue price of 99.50 pct for a 6.25pct eight-year open mortgage bond, giving it a yield about 1/4pct higher than the market average.    Rabobank stopped trading in the bond five minutes after thebourse opened, but already between 200 and 300 mln guildersworth had been sold, a Rabobank spokesman said. One Japaneseinvestor took 50 mln guilders alone, a dealer said.    Later, the bank proposed to allot only 30 pct ofsubscriptions, causing a general outcry among traders. Rabobankfinally gave in to bourse demands to honour all subscriptions.    "We simply did not expect prices to rise so much," a Rabobankspokesman said." Since the pricing, the bond price index hasrisen 0.9 to 117.3, and the average state loan yield has fallenaccordingly to 6.04 pct.    Two weeks ago, Rabobank issued a 250 mln guilder 6.75 pctbond at par, giving it a yield 0.40 above the average bank loanyields that day of 6.35 pct. The issue was heavilyover-subscribed. REUTER&#3;
