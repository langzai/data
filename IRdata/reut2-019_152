Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maizeimports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchweymade the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnesof rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aidprogramme.    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, followsgovernment concern over "lower than average rainfall in southernGhana and its implications for the major harvest."    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growingareas throughout the south this year. The Ministry ofAgriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in allmajor staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequencesof current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the droughtexperiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps toalleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriouslyaffected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in partsof the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers havedried up. Reuter&#3;
