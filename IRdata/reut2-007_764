Swiss banks are holding talks withProtestant and Roman Catholic officials to hear churchcomplaints about lending to South Africa, the Swiss Bankers'Association said.    In a statement the Association said the parties haddisagreed over economic sanctions.    But all participants -- representatives of the threebiggest Swiss banks, the Bankers' Association itself, thechurches and church charities -- agreed to condemn SouthAfrica's apartheid policy both publicly and in contacts withbusiness and government offices there.    After two private sessions last August and on March 10,they agreed the meetings should continue.    Swiss banks are criticised by the churches who say they arein effect lending support to the South African government.    The banks assured the churchmen that their lending haddeclined substantially last year and that they had no intentionof building it up as banks from other countries withdrew.    Pius Haffner of the Catholic charity Justitia et Pax toldReuters, "It is at least a small step forward when the banks saypublicly they will not jump in when other banks pull out." REUTER&#3;
