(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said itexpects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in thesecond half of 1986 to continue this year. The continuedimprovement would be due to good market demand, better productprices and high operating capacity, the company said in itsannual report.    Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said itsjoint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar,B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contributeto equity earnings.    Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.    The company said it views its near-term prospects withimproved optimism.    It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in theU.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacityand production and more favorable market conditions.    It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, andexpects higher sales and earnings for its other North Americanpackaging divisions.    Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its EuropaCarton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputesbetween the United States and the European Economic Communityon the West German economy and the higher value of the mark maylead to increased costs which could not be offset by priceincreases.
