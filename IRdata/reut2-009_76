Gencorp Inc said that because it iscontinuing to evaluate General Acquisition Inc's tender offerit has fixed April 3, subject to further extension, as the datethe rights to purchase preferred shares will trade separatelyfrom the common stock as a result of the tender offer.    This extension of the expiration date is conditioned on noperson acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more ofGencorp's common stock prior to April 3, it said.    Gencorp said it could distribute the rights certificates toshareholders 10 to 30 days after the March 18 acquisition offerwas made.    However, rather than leaving the expiration date in arange, the board decided to set April 3 as the day it willdistribute the preferred share purchase rights.    Reuter&#3;
