The special prosecutor in the Iran armsscandal is expected to bring indictments that could includefelony charges against senior Reagan administration officials,the New York Times reported.    It quoted law enforcement officials with knowledge of theinvestigation as saying special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, whois investigating the scandal, was focusing on three areas.    The paper identified these as conspiracy to defraud thegovernment, obstructing justice and making false statements tothe government. It said the prosecutor had not ruled out anysuspects, including current and former government officials.    But the paper said Walsh, in his investigation of the saleof arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to the U.S.-backedcontra rebels in Nicaragua, was running short of time. This wasbecause Congress has begun granting immunity to key figures inthe affair to speed up congressional investigations.    The paper quoted one official as saying that, whileobstruction of justice was usually hard to prove, evidence of acover-up "may have been comically obvious here." REUTER&#3;
