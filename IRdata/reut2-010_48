The chairman of the CFTC, SusanPhillips, said she does not expect the CFTC to restrict dualtrading or to intervene in the quarterly expiration of stockindex futures and their options.     "At this time we have no plans to reexamine our policy (ondual trading)," she told the House Subcommittee onConservation, Credit and Rural Development.    She said it would not be appropriate to ban dual tradingbecause it would decrease market liquidity.    Dual trading refers to the ability of futures commissionmerchants to trade for their own as well as their clients'accounts. Exchange rules prohibit a broker from attempting tobenefit from the market impact of a client's order by tradingon his own account before placing the client's order.    CFTC has required all futures exchanges by July 1 to haveimplemented audit trails permitting the reconstruction of alltrades to the nearest minute. The move was designed in part todiscourage abuse of dual trading.    The board of directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchangehas proposed limiting but not banning dual trading in theStandard and Poor's 500 stock index future pit.    Phillips indicated the CFTC would not move beyond requiringimproved audit trails in its effort to allay concerns aboutdual trading abuses.    "It would be inappropriate at this point until we see howthe audit trail will work," she said in response to a question.    On triple-witching, Phillips said recent experiments bymarkets to quell price fluctuations have been quite successfuland that users of securities and derivative instruments werestill learning how to deal with the quarterly phenomenon.    Triple-witching refers to the simultaneous expiration ofstock index futures, options on those futures and options oncertain individual stocks.    The CFTC chairman noted the commission has heightenedsurveillance of markets on triple-witching day.    "We aren't sure any other regulatory changes are needed atthis point," Phillips said. Reuter&#3;
