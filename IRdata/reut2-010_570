The Emirates Industrial Bank haspredicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab statesfollowing higher oil revenues.    A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, saidtotal oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from33.5 billion in 1986.    The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabiaand the United Arab Emirates (UAE).    The bank said the improvement would result from higher oilprices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrainoverall group production.    These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eightdollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.    "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery inthe economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expectedgrowth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,"the study said.    It added, however, that GCC states would experience higherbudget deficits this year because of needs arising from pastrecession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.    The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would riseto 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.    It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combinedtrade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in1985.    The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic productto 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, itadded. REUTER&#3;
