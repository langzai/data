Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaromet his Swiss counterpart Otto Stich, Swiss Economics MinisterJean-Pascal Delamuraz and National Bank President PierreLanguetin on the fourth leg of a tour to discuss his country'sdebt problems.    Funaro told reporters his trip, which has already taken himto London, Paris and Bonn, was aimed at explaining hiscountry's stance to governments. Talks with commercial bankswill take place at a later date.    Funaro said a mechanism would have to be found to endBrazil's debt crisis but it would not be easy.    Brazil would not repeat the measures it took in response toits debt crisis of 1982, which he said had provoked the biggestrecession in his country's history, he added.    He said European and Japanese banks were showing a moreflexible attitude towards Brazil's problems than U.S. Banks andit was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter.    A Swiss official said the Brazilian delegation had made nodemands.    Funaro, who travels to Italy this evening, said it wasunclear if he would go to Japan on Friday or return to Brazilfirst.
