An organization of TennesseeValley Authority industrial customers said it has joined theTVA in asking a court to prevent the U.S. Department of Energyfrom witholding contracted payments to TVA.    The Tennessee Valley Industrial Committee said it isseeking permission to intervene in TVA's federal district courtlawsuit requesting DOE be enjoined from witholding payments dueunder "minimum demand" provisions of the TVA's contract tosupply electricity to uranium enrichment facilities at OakRidge, Tenn., and Paducah, Ky.       Such provisions obligate TVA to make available a certainamount of power and the customer -- in this case the DOE --agrees to pay the fixed costs associated with that amount ofpower whether is is used or not.    The committee represents 27 large, energy-intensiveindustries with operations in the TVA service area. Theseindustries, like DOE, are served directly by TVA as opposed togoing through a local distributors.    The TVA has said DOE's intention, announced last week, towithhold increasing percentages of its electric bill willresult in a revenue shortfall of about 250 mln dlrs and forcean about six pct rate increase to all other customers.
