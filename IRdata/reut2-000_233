The U.S. Economy continued to expand inFebruary but at a slower pace than in January, which saw aspurt of activity, the National Association of PurchasingManagement (NAPM) said in a report.    The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It wasthe seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicatorwas over 50 pct.    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economyis in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a decliningeconomy.    The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managersat 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growthrate in new orders and production slowed in February.    But production remained vigorous, with more than threetimes as many members reporting it better rather than worse.    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but membersreported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp graduallyresumed production.    The same number of members reported inventories were higheras reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happenedsince August 1984.    For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported payinghigher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nineto one.    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business surveycommittee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February,but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of neworders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects fora respectable first quarter."    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, basedon five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. REUTER&#3;
