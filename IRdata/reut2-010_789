The United States does not expectthe executive board meeting of the International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, to call for a new round of negotiations onreinstating coffee quotas, a U.S. government official said.    The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talksearlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks areexpected because there is no indication the negotiatingpositions of major producers and consumers have changed.    The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition ofcoffee quotas, that "objective criteria" be set forestablishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not tobe identified. Brazil, the major producer, insists on quotasbased on a traditional formula.    The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only ifsome new flexibility is apparent from major countries, theofficial said.    The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London. Reuter&#3;
