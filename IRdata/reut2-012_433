Japan is sending a three-man team toWashington to try to halt threatened trade sanctions thatofficials warn could spark a wave of anti-U.S. Sentiment here.    The team will lay the groundwork for high-level emergencytalks next week aimed at defusing an increasingly bitter rowover trade in computer microchips, officials said.    "The sanctions are against the free trade system," Ministryof International Trade and Industry (MITI) director generalNoboru Hatakeyama told reporters, adding: "If these measures aretaken, the atmosphere in Japan against the United States wouldbecome not so good as before."    Other officials were more blunt. "The U.S. Action will havea significant impact on the growing anti-U.S. Feeling (here),"another MITI official said.    A senior Foreign Ministry official, who declined to beidentified, told Reuters the U.S. Threats have undercut thosein the government who argue for conciliation.    "There is a very strong argument in Japan that since theUnited States is imposing tariffs unilaterally, why should webother doing anything," he said. "Anything we do, we will bebashed."    The senior official sounded pessimistic about thelikelihood of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defusing U.S.Anger over Japanese trade practices when he visits Washingtonon April 29.    "I don't think trade friction will be solved all of a sudden(by the visit)," he said.    Nakasone is widely expected to present a package ofmeasures to President Reagan to help contain U.S. Frustrationover Japan's large trade surplus.    But the senior official played down those expectations. REUTER&#3;
