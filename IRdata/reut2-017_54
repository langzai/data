The Swiss National Bank will continue totake part in concerted intervention on currency markets asnecessary, president Pierre Languetin told the bank's annualmeeting.    He said the dollar had on occasion hit highs or lows whichbore no relation to economic fundamentals and cooperationbetween all monetary authorities was necessary to prevent itbreaching thresholds that would damage everyone.    "We are resolved -- as we have done in the past -- to takepart in concerted intervention to the extent that this ispossible and desirable," Languetin said.    Languetin said Switzerland had noted with satisfaction thesix nation Paris accord on currency stabilisation measures inFebruary, adding that it had anchored the principle ofstrengthened international cooperation.    He said measures such as recent concerted intervention wereuseful in the short term.    But he added, "The (Paris) Louvre accord can produce nolasting effects without a correction of the fundamentalimbalances, without a reduction of the American budget deficitand without stronger growth in Europe and Japan."    Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessaryin the "too expansive" monetary policy of the United States,adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supplywas expanding too strongly.    "If this should last long the dollar could only bestabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetarypolicy on the part of the other central banks, which would inturn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation,"he said. One positive factor was that monetary authorities inthe most important countries had not relinquished theiranti-inflation policies. REUTER&#3;
