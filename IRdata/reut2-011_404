Exxon Corp said that it will move toprotect its directors from liabilities arising from lawsuitscharging gross negligence.    Exxon said directors' liabilities will be limited and theywill be indemnified for actions taken in pursuit of duties.    The company said it was taking the opportunity to changeits bylaws and incoroporation certificate following changes inthe law of New Jersey, where the company is incoporated.    The measures are being submitted to shareholders and willbe voted on at Exxon's annual meeting to be held May 21 in NewOrleans the company said in proxy material sent toshareholders.    Shareholders are being asked to approve an amendment to thecompany's certificate to eliminate directors' maximum personalmonetary liability to the limit New Jersey allows.    New Jersey recently permitted corporations to eliminatemonetary liability directors and owners may incur for breach ofduty care owed by them to corporations and shareholders.    The company said that the principal effect of the measure"will be to eliminate potential monetary damage actions againstdirectors."    But the amendment will only limit liability in the event ofunintentional errors.    It does not limit their liability for actions taken inknowing violation of the law, nor will it limit potentialliabilities from violations of federal securities laws, thecompany said in its proxy statemernt.    A second measure proposed to shareholders is an amendmentto bylaws already voted on by the directors at their JanuaryBoard meeting making indeminifiacation of directors mandatory.    Exxon said that it had currently purchased such insurancefrom a captive insurance copany in the amount of 50 mln dlrs inexcess of 50 mln dlrs issued by independent companies to Exxonto indemnify its directors.
