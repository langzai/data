The European &lt;Airbus Industrie> consortiumis to change the lead engine on its A-340 aircraft because thehigh-technology superfan engine will not be ready by 1992, acompany spokesman said.   Airbus has chosen the Franco-U.S. CFM-56-S3 engines toreplace the &lt;International Aero Engine> (IAE) consortium'ssuperfan. The spokesman added the new engine, to be produced byGeneral Electric Co of the U.S. And SNECMA of France, canprovide greater thrust than the IAE rival.    The spokesman said the IAE consortium, which includes Prattand Whitney of the U.S. And Britain's &lt;Rolls Royce>, is unableto supply its superfan engines in time for mid-1992 when theA-340 is due to become operational.    Airbus signed an agreement with IAE last December,replacing an earlier accord with GE and &lt;SNECMA>, whose CFM-56engine could then offer no more than a 28,600 lbs thrust,compared to the proposed superfan's 30,000 lbs.    The latest version of the CFM-56, however, can provide a30,600 lbs thrust.    The Airbus spokesman said the consortium's decision did notexclude the IAE superfan, once ready, being offered as analternative engine on the A-340 as the superfan was morefuel-efficient than the CFM engine.    The spokesman said Airbus expected IAE to come back withsome proposals on superfan's new production timetable withinthe next few weeks or months. Reuter&#3;
