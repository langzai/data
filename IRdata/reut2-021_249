Mining group Boliden AB said it hadagreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and MineralOrganisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia toexploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.    Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedishgroup would  be responsible for the technical side of theoperation and would have no control over the product itself.    He said one option under discussion for refining the goldore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter innorthern Sweden.    Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said itwas strategically important since it increased Boliden'spresence in Saudi Arabia.    "Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskaralready...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of thefuture," he said.    The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahabin the west of the country and should open in the first half of1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of goldsmelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.    Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in SaudiArabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine toopen in modern times.    "This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of miningtechnology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, KjellNilsson. Reuter&#3;
