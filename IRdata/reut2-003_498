China welcomed a U.S. Supreme Courtdecision dismissing claims by holders of 41 mln dlrs ofpre-1949 Chinese bonds, but U.S. Officials said Peking has along way to go before it can issue bonds in the U.S.     A Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news briefing thatChina welcomed a Monday court ruling, which rejected a petitionby holders of railway bonds issued in 1911 by the ruling Qingdynasty, which the Communist government does not acknowledge.     The spokesman said the ruling "indicates the ... Railwaybearer bonds case is finally closed."    But a U.S. Embassy official said that two other bond caseswere still in litigation and it was not known if the othercourts involved would accept the Supreme Court ruling.    China has issued much of its recent overseas debt in Japan,and has been badly hit by the yen's sharp rise. A Westernbanker said the U.S. Market has become more attractive toChina, since it is likely to issue bonds denominated incurrencies other than yen, and so protect itself against futurecurrency fluctuations.    But a Western diplomat warned that potential U.S. Buyerswould not give China the warm reception it received in Japan.    "U.S. Investors are not interested in China per se, as manyJapanese are. China has no track record in the U.S. Bondmarket. Investors may demand disclosure of information Chineseinstitutions are unwilling to give," he said.    He said potential buyers might scrutinise China's humanrights record. Some institutions are reportedly concerned aboutrecent events in China, including a drive by the Chinese mediaagainst "bourgeois liberalism."    An official of state-owned China International Trust andInvestment Corp, which has raised funds in Hong Kong, Tokyo andFrankfurt, declined comment on the court decision. REUTER&#3;
