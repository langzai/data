The administration is expanding itscrackdown on bad debts, officials of the White House Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) told reporters.    OMB Deputy Director Joseph Wright said the administrationthis year plans to turn over to private credit rating firmsdata on about 3.5 mln "deadbeats" who are seriously behind or indefault in their payments on federal loans.    Next year, the government will turn over to privatecollection bureaus four billion dlrs in bad education loans andthree billion dlrs in other bad government loans, Wright said.    The government is also considering letting individuals makepayments on their student loans with credit cards, officialstold reporters.    The Internal Revenue Service is already studying the use ofcredit cards to pay income taxes, but this usage would requirea change in federal law while no congressional action would beneeded for credit cards to be used for student loans, theofficials said.    The officials disclosed these plans in releasing the thirdannual OMB report to Congress on management of the U.S.government.    The report details steps to be taken by the administrationto increase federal efficiency and to continue PresidentReagan's highly publicized "war on waste, fraud and abuse."    According to the report, elinquent U.S. debt had soared to68.3 billion dlrs, or 18.8 pct of total receivables, by the endof the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. At the end offiscal 1981, when Reagan took office, bad debt stood at 29.8billion dlrs or 12.3 pct of total debt.    But OMB officials said other Reagan administration effortshad already saved taxpayers 84 billion dlrs and would saveanother 25 billion dlrs or so by the time Reagan left office. Reuter&#3;
