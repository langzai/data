The Securities Industry Associationendorsed legislation expected to come before the Senate BankingCommittee tomorrow imposing a moratorium on new powers forcommercial banks.    Robert Gerard, managing director of Morgan Stanley and Co,told reporters his group, which mainly represents investmentbanking firms, supported committee members who want the FederalReserve Board to postpone action on applications by three bankholding companies seeking new powers.    "The Fed ought to hold those applications in abeyancepending congressional review," Gerard said.         The legislation before the committee would recapitalize afederal desposit insurance fund for savings and loanassociations and prohibit new nonbank banks.    Gerard said the securities association had no position onnonbank banks.    The association wants Congress to undertake a comprehensivestudy before changing the Glass-Steagall Act, which separatescommercial and investment banking activities, Gerard said.Until the study is completed, the Fed should not act on theapplications by Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Co. and Bankers TrustNew York Corp to underwrite and deal in securities, he said.       The study was likely to show substantial benefits fromcontinuing the separation of commercial and investment banking,he said.    Gerard said the group believes a proposal by House SpeakerJim Wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and wouldhurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension fundsthat invest in securities.    "It may reduce the volume of activity, but the tax is a taxon the saver and investor," Gerard said.    In addition, a U.S. tax would drive business from theUnited States to other countries, he said.              Reuter&#3;
