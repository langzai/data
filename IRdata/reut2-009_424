A British voter opinion poll intomorrow's Today newspaper shows a surge in support for thecentrist Alliance grouping and a fall for both the rulingConservatives and the Labour opposition party.    The Marplan poll gives the Conservatives 36 pct, theLiberal/Social Democratic Alliance 31 pct, and Labour 31 pct aswell. A Marplan survey last month gave the Tories 38 pct, theAlliance 21 pct, and Labour 37 pct.    The latest poll would, if translated into an electionresult, produce a hung parliament, analysts said. That shoulddampen speculation of an early June election, they added. Reuter&#3;
