The Bundesbank sees no current reasonto change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesingertold Reuters in a telephone interview.    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarksyesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and WestBerlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealerssaid, revived some speculation that German interest rate cutsmay once again be under discussion.    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of histwo central bank council colleagues.    But he added that the last central bank council meeting onApril 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of"subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news broughtby several state central bank presidents.    "Much is going better than the impression gained by thepublic from the January figures, which have been in themeantime superseded," he said.    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after adecline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9pct after they had been unchanged in December.    Bank economists said that the two together showed theeconomy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarterof 1987.    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, asteady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/markrate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl OttoPoehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMFmeeting.    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rateson repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchasetender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the centralbank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14days, this is hardly probable."    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had movedaway from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one oftargetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have nocomment on the subject while negotiations were still inprogress in Washington.
