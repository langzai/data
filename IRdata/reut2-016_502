World Bank President Barber Conablesaid he opposed forgiving developing countries' debt becausethe proposal, if adopted, would lead to a cutoff in lending tothe indebted countries.    "I think (debt) forgiveness will simply create anenvironment in which no more money will go into development anda lot of the world will be consigned to poverty and toinstability indefinitely," he told ABC Television on Sunday.    A number of bills have been introduced in Congress thatwould require commercial banks to forgive a least a portion ofthe debt owed them by cash-starved developing countries.    "I think we've got to find ways of encouraging continuousimprovement in policies, of wise use of money in short, ratherthan trying to turn everybody off," Conable said.    Conable told ABC's "Business World" he supported TreasurySecretary James Baker's debt plan as an "andidote to debt."    Baker has said the best way to reduce the developingcountries' debt burden is to boost their growth rates throughreformed domestic policies and increased commercial banklending. Reuter&#3;
