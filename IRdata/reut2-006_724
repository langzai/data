Arkansas Best Corp said its1987 first quarter earnings will be significantly lower thanfully diluted earnings of 22-1/2 cts per share in last year'sfirst quarter.    The company said pricing competition and lower trafficlevels in the motor carrier industry hurt its first quarterresults.    However, the company said its furniture and tire operationsare more profitable this year than last year.    Arkansas Best also said that if the industry sustains theupcoming 2.9 pct motor carrier rate hike it will offset theTeamster labor increase scheduled for April 1.    It said the labor increase then will be 3.2 pct for ABFFreight System, its largest unit. Reuter&#3;
