European Community steelmakerspresented the Executive Commission with a controversial planfor the future of the industry which diplomats say it may beforced reluctantly to accept.    Under the plan steel output would remain subject torestrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled foryears to come while steel firms undertook a massiveslimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed theending of the quota system by December 1988.    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EClaw is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis."    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss thisidea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis intheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch toalternative products and accounts firmly in the red.    Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries arelikely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back theindustry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising thepolitical impact of plant closures, they said.    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by theEC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quotaproduction system at least until the end of 1990.    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for itidentified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis toreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.    Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, thatof hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.    Eurofer added the industry would need the support of theCommission and governments in carrying out a closure program,particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.    The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs thisdecade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes. Reuter&#3;
