The European Community (EC) agreed onnew rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and busesin an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vaststretches of the region's forests.    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreedmember states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next fewyears the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the mainsource of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, withtougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 andfor all new vehicles from October 1990.    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level ofnitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a yearfrom three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if allheavy vehicles met the new standards.    There are an estimated nine mln trucks and buses in use inthe EC, according to Commission figures.    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to movetowards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonnrequested permission to do so to encourage the use oflow-pollution cars, diplomats said.
