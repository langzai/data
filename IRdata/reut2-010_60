Several U.S. House members urgedthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to strengthenits proposed rules governing the sale of foreign futures andoptions in the U.S.      "I'm from the state of Illinois, and we don't want to seeChicago's futures markets become the automobile or textileindustry of the 1980s," Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill.) told a hearingof the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Creditand Rural Development.      U.S. exchanges have complained that the proposedregulations would give sellers of foreign futures an edge overdomestic futures sellers because they would be subject to lessrigorous requirements, especially in the area of capital.      Phillips said the commission has no way of requiringforeign markets to implement the same regulatory safeguards asin the U.S., but that the proposed rules would ensure marketingof foreign futures and options conform to U.S. requirements.     "If people want to enter into these (foreign) markets,they know they will not have the same regulations," she said.      Phillips said the commission would consider changes inits proposal to require segregation of customer accounts andclarify the treatment of contracts not traded on foreignexchanges. Reuter&#3;
