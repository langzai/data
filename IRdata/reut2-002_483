Pay talks aimed at ending aweek-old national seamen's strike collapsed today and thestrike will continue, a union official said.    The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 shipsin various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official ofthe National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters.    The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, haverejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil companyPetrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union ofMaritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).    Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeirowith Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today withoutresolving the dispute.    He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands,Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.    Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern tothe government, which has suspended interest payments on partof Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration inthe country's trade balance.    The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, MuriloRubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strikecontinued foreign ships could be authorized to transportBrazilian exports.
