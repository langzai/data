Sharp price hikes for food and fuelplanned by the government could provoke an open confrontationwith workers and endanger Poland's fragile post-Solidaritystability, a government trade union leader has warned.    Romuald Sosnowski, deputy chairman of the national tradeunion alliance OPZZ, said the unions' strong rejection of theincreases yesterday was prompted by the hostility of lower-paidworkers.    The authorities told the OPZZ on Tuesday that food priceswould rise by an average of 13 pct but ncreases for fuels --including electricity and gas -- would be much higher.    They said wage increases would be limited to 12 pct in 1987and that employers who breached the ceiling would be punishedthrough additional taxes. Reuter&#3;
