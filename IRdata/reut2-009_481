The chairman of the U.S. Senatecommittee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concernedabout a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted bythe Canadian House of Commons last week.    The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral tradingagreement with the United States while protecting Canadianpolitical sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketingsystems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity.    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said theresolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed freetrade agreement between the two countries, which are eachother's largest trading partners.    "We need a truly free trade agreement, which means bothcountries have to work toward a deal that is mutuallybeneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement," the TexasDemocrat said in a statement.    "I do not question Canada's right to protect its politicalsovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrasesmean the government of Canada means to take important economicissues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeplyconcerned," he added.    Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways whilethe United States uses only six trade restriction methods. Hesaid if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries getrid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fairand might not win Senate approval.    "I am deeply concerned that when the President visits PrimeMinister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented withthis kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I didwhen I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficialagreement will be successful," Bentsen said.    Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 inOttawa.    Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that wouldban imports of independently produced films into Canada bynon-Canadians, which the senator called a protectionistmeasure. Reuter&#3;
