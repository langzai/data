London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc(Lasmo) &lt;LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices riseagain and it is confident this will happen early in the nextdecade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.    Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil andgas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oilequivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every yearsince 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.    The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,down from 118 mln in 1985.    It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.    The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop inoil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mlnstg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand forlower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.    The company said had very few exploration wells committedfor 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in itsexploration program. Even without further success, the existingfields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly toprofit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.    Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement. REUTER&#3;
