&lt;Salomon Brothers Inc> is not withdrawingas a market maker in euroyen bonds, contrary to strong marketrumours circulating in London, a London-based spokeswoman forthe company's New York headquarters said.    Earlier, a spokesman for Salomon Brothers' Londonoperations declined to comment at all on rumours that have beencirculating here.    Euroyen bond traders had said they were informallycontacted by their counterparts at Salomon and told that theywould no longer be market makers in those securities.    The traders said that Salomon had not notified theAssociation of International Bond Dealers (AIBD) of its plansto withdraw as a market maker. Under new rules recently adoptedby the AIBD, notification would be required if the firm decidedit no longer wished to make two-way prices at all times ineuroyen bonds.    According to dealers at several Japanese banks, Salomon'seuroyen bond traders have been in a meeting and unavailable tomake prices. Market sources said that Salomon had offered thetraders a chance to remain with the firm if they were willingto trade eurobonds denominated in other currencies.    Dealers noted that at one point this year, euroyen bondissuance had actually outpaced that of eurodollar denominatedbonds, the first time the U.S. Unit has been eclipsed as thecurrency of choice for international borrowers.    Dealers said that given the dollar's recent weakness, theyen could once again top the eurobond issuance tables.    Last week, Salomon Brothers announced it would trim itsworldwide staff by 800 and withdraw from several areas ofbusiness, most specifically short term bank lending. REUTER&#3;
