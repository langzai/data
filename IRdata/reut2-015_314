Hawkeye Bancorp's 1986 annualfinancial results were qualified by its auditors, according tothe annual report.    "...there are conditions which may indicate that thecompany will be unable to continue as a going concern,"auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annualreport to shareholders.    Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citingan increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs andrestructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.    However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet itsobligations for the next 12-month period."    Last July the bank holding company reached a debtrestructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiariesand five non-bank operations for disposition.    "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financialcondition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able tosurvive as a going concern," the report said.    Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to complywith provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatoryagreements and on its ability to return to profitableoperations, it said.    There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meetthese requirements. However, the company "believes it will beable to do so," Hawkeye said. Reuter&#3;
