Land damaged by wind in the 10-stateGreat Plains amount to nearly 3.7 mln acres so far this year,one-third more than the 1970-84 average and 300,000 acres morethan the amount reported at this time last year, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In addition to the land reported damaged, another 15 mlnacres are unprotected and susceptible to wind damage, 34 pctmore than the 1970-84 average, but about one mln acres lessthan last year.    The states hardest hit were in the Northern Plains, wherewind damaged 2.4 mln acres, an increase of 1.5 mln acres overthe amount reported a year ago, the department said.    Suffering the most damage in the Northern Plains wereMontana (1.3 mln acres), and North Dakota (518,500 acres.)    Of the five Southern Plains states, only Colorado reportedan increase in wind-damaged land over last year, it said.    Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas reported a reductionin damaged land, due in part to emergency conservation tillagepractices and in part to rainfall and weather conditions.    Of the land damaged, 96.2 pct was cropland, 3.5 pctrangeland, and 0.9 pct was other land.    Inadequate snow cover and high winds, coupled with a lackof erosion control practices such as windbreaks andconservation tillage, contributed to the increased wind damagedland in some areas, the department said.    Data on wind damage is collected during November-June. Reuter&#3;
