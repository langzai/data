The Federal Reserve will promote lowerinterest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line againstinflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit withoutsubverting national U.S. economic policy.    "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,because the trade deficit is not responding, the United Statesdecided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet theircommitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do itspart by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.    "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession orseriously higher interest rates, securities market participantshave seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.    He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency ratesand bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanesewindow dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-averageeconomic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-upseems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory buildingand the prospect for the full year is still for real grossnational product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.
