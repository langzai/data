Culp Inc, citing lower margins,said it expects income from operations in its second quarterending October 31 to be lower than in the same year-ago period.    But Culp said that due to a capital gain from the sale ofits Culp Industrial Fabrics unit, net income for the quartershould be higher than the 1.5 mln dlrs, or 35 cts per share, itearned in the 1986 third quarter.    Culp also said it expects it will be difficult in itscurrent fiscal year to match the 5.2 mln dlrs it earned for theyear ended May 2, 1987, even if it included the capital gainfrom the sale of the division.
