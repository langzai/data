The Center for Auto Safety, a privateauto industry watchdog group, sought a government recall of50,000 schoolbuses, charging that a defect in their manufacturecauses the buses to split open in a crash.    The center said it asked the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration (NHTSA) to recall all school buses builtsince 1977 by Thomas Built Buses of High Point, N.C..    "In the past seven years, 45 children were injured and sixkilled in crashes of Thomas schoolbuses where the panels of thebuses split open at the joints," Executive Director ClarenceDitlow wrote Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.    NHTSA is a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation.    Ditlow said Thomas had failed eight body and three floorjoint tests since 1977. "No Thomas schoolbus tested for jointstrength since (a federal standard) was adopted in 1978 hasever passed," he said.    Officials of Thomas were unavailable for comment.    NHTSA officials had no immediate comment on the recallpetition. Reuter&#3;
