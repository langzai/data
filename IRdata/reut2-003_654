The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)is reviewing whether Trans World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> andChairman Carl Icahn violated federal antitrust law by failingto seek advance clearance from the DOJ or the Federal TradeCommission for his extensive open-market purchases of USAirGroup Inc &lt;U> stock, a DOJ official told a Senate panel.    "This is a matter that is being looked into," Charles Rule,acting assistant attorney general-antitrust, told the SenateJudiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee.    Rule declined further comment while the review wascontinuing.    Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum(D-Ohio), who had asked why the department was not actingagainst "what appears to be a clear violation of the law."    Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-mergernotification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15mln dlrs' worth of USAir stock.    But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaserwould be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed amerger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation.    Icahn filed such an application with the DOT, but thefiling was thrown out by the DOT on Friday.    The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds itlacked the necessary data for the government to review theproposed USAir takeover bid.    Icahn refiled a more complete application form Monday.    Rule pledged to act against Icahn and TWA if a violationwere found. Reuter&#3;
