A meeting of European Community (EC)farm ministers is unlikely to be held next week following theministers' failure to agree a 1987/88 farm price packageyesterday, an EC Commission spokesman said.    However, he said he could not rule out such a meetingaltogether, noting the decision is one for Belgium, whichcurrently holds the presidency of the EC council of ministers.    The farm ministers could also meet in parallel with themeeting of EC heads of government in Brussels on June 29 and30, diplomats noted.    The ministers ended their three-day meeting in Luxembourgstill split on the question of an oils and fats tax and withWest Germany saying it would use its veto on two other keyaspects of EC Commission proposals, the actual common pricechanges and a revision of the "green money" system.    The Commission spokesman said an announcement is likely toappear in the EC's Official Journal within a few days givingnotice of the Commission's intention to take emergency measuresfrom July 1 should ministers fail to reach an accord.    However, Commission sources said this notice would notdetail the measures to be taken, which, they said, might beconsidered by the Commission at its regular weekly meeting nextWednesday.    The Commission published a declaration by EC FarmCommissioner Frans Andriessen made in Luxembourg earlyyesterday at the end of the agriculture ministers' meeting.    In it, Andriessen said there was now a serious threat tothe functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy.    Andriessen added ,"The Commission...Will take the measureswhich are necessary, not only for the temporary management ofthe markets, but also for a healthy finance policy."    "This means that the protective measures we are going toapply will necessarily have, in the context of our own powers,a dynamic character," he said. REUTER&#3;
