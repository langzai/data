Mozambique appealed for an additional160 mln dlrs in emergency humanitarian aid to help the countrythrough a severe economic crisis.    Prime Minister Mario Machungo told a news conferenceseveral countries -- notably the U.S., Britain and Italy -- hadalready made pledges towards this new appeal.    The U.S. offered grain amounting to a third of the nation'sannual consumption, Britain offered eight mln stg and Italy wasexpected to offer 30 to 35 mln dlrs, he said.    The country's "extremely severe economic crisis" stemmed fromcontinued fighting with "armed bandits" -- a euphemism foranti-government guerrillas -- and a series of floods which havedestroyed crops, Machungo said.    An estimated four million people require emergency care. Reuter&#3;
