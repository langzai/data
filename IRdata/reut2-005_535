New Nebraska Republican SenatorDavid Karnes said he supports proposals to "decouple" farmsubsidies from production decisions.    Karnes, formerly a vice president of Scoular Grain Co. inOmaha, was appointed last week to complete the term of the lateSen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Nebr.).    On target prices, Karnes said he believes the gradualreductions in supports included in the 1985 farm bill should becontinued, but administration proposals for 10 pct cuts intarget prices each year are "excessive."    Karnes said he opposes mandatory production controls formajor crops. His predecessor, Sen. Zorinsky, had supportedmandatory controls for wheat and was the author of a farm billprovision requiring a referendum on the subject last year.    Sen. Karnes accompanied Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) tothe National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) conventionearlier today and spoke to Reuters after Boschwitz addressedthe NGFA meeting.    Karnes said he is seeking a seat on the Senate AgricultureCommittee but no decision has been made on the request.    Karnes, who has not held political office before, wasappointed by Nebraska Republican Governor Kay Orr. He will beup for election in 1988. Reuter&#3;
