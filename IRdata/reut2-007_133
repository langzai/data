Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to helpavert what his departmet has called the threat of increasedreliance on foreign oil in the coming years.    He said at a news conference that any recommendation hewould make would have to increase domestic production, notcause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost tothe U.S. taxpayer.    On the grounds of increasing production, he said, "I wouldrule out a gasoline tax."    Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil importfee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- theloss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil pricesand a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billiondlrs.    He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, onnew and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be acheap way to spur domestic production.    He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year.    Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance tothe White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool.    The White House said it would study the proposal, but wasgenerally oppposed to altering the national tax code, justpassed last year.    Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction,said, "If I were the White House, I would be cool, too." Reuter&#3;
