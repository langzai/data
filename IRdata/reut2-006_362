West German finance minister GerhardStoltenberg suggested that the U.K. Should join the EuropeanMonetary System (EMS) and also urged some member countries toabandon their dual currency structures.    Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of the Committee fora Currency Union in Europe, whose key members are former WestGerman Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French PresidentValery Giscard d'Estaing, founders of the EMS.    He said, "One failing of the EMS is important countries,like Great Britain, are not members. Other partners should giveup their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations."    EMS member Belgium has both a "financial" and a "commercial"franc and the Italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pctagainst other member currencies, compared with a permittedfluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies.    According to a text of Stoltenberg's speech, the financeminister also urged greater convergence of economic andfinancial policies among European countries.    He added that monetary stability should be a priority forEuropean countries and, with reference to the U.S. Dollar, hesaid it was wrong to presume that a "permanent devaluation" wasthe answer to economic problems.    Stoltenberg said there were clear reasons to bring down thedollar in 1985. "But an overshooting in the other direction nowbrings the danger of a new inflationary push for the U.S. Andother countries whose currencies have declined," he added.    He said such a development could also produce furtherburdens for heavily indebted developing countries. An agreementlast month in Paris by industrial countries to stabilise thedollar around current levels had acknowledged these risks, hesaid. REUTER&#3;
