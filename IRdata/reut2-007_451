A U.S. Navy battle group led by theU.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is in the northern Arabian Seaamid renewed concern about the safety of shipping off the coastof Iran, U.S. officials said today.    But Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffmann said that reports thenaval strike force was in the region did not mean the UnitedStates was sending a new warning to Iran against escalatingattacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.    "Nothing like that has happened," he said. "No signal is beingsent."    He said that the Kitty Hawk is operating in an area whereit usually does. "It's normal. It's in the waters where it'ssupposed to be. It's been there for over a month."    The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstayof the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast areaextending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.    With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to thesouth and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf tothe north, the United States has 10 warships on either end ofthe strategic Straits of Hormuz.    The Pentagon, as is its custom, declined to confirm theexact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to.    State Department officials cited concern about the safetyof ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supplyrun to the Gulf.    Iran has conducted repeated attacks on shipping in the Gulfand U.S. officials have said that Teheran has recently equippeditself with powerful Chinese and Italian-made anti-shipmissiles, posing a greater threat.
