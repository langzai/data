Jordan's key economic priorities arehaving a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchangereserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa'i said.    "First, the national treasury should be in sound shape whendealing with the public and other countries so that itscredibility is preserved," he said in a television interviewSaturday.    "The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level offoreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability andconfidence needed by the government to meet foreigncommitments."    Rifa'i said Jordan's outstanding government-guaranteed andcommercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratioof 14.9 pct.    The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinarsin outstanding loans at the end of September, according tolatest Central Bank figures.    Rifa'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economistshere that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies,is overvalued.    "The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserveits stability," he said.    The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit wouldtackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan.Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was toreceive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United ArabEmirates to help it resist Israel.    But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the othersfailed because of falling income due to lower oil prices. REUTER&#3;
