Texaco Inc chairman Alfred DeCrane saidthe massive stock market correction could affect any out ofcourt settlement of the company's 10.3 billion dlr legaldispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    However, DeCrane refused to say whether the two companieswere holding any settlement negotiations.    "Certainly the market shakeout might affect the way this ishandled," DeCrane told reporters following a speech at ameeting of the International Association of DrillingContractors.    "In this environment, cash looks very important."    DeCrane declined to say whether Texaco and Pennzoil hadheld any recent settlement talks, citing a confidentialityagreement between the two companies.    "A few months ago Texaco offered 100 mln dlrs cash, nostrings attached just to take this appeal to the Texas SupremeCourt," DeCrane said. He was referring to a non-settlementproposal that would have eliminated the threat of Pennzoilfiling liens, or ownership rights, against Texaco propertybefore the company filed for bankruptcy protection in April.    "I think that (the offer) looks pretty good now to aPennzoil shareholder whose stock is trading around 30 or 40."    Settlement talks between the two companies reportedly brokedown earlier this year after Pennzoil insisted it would notsettle for less than four billion dlrs.    Since then, Texaco has asked the Texas State Supreme Courtto review the 10.3 billion dlr judgment against it.    DeCrane also said it was not clear if the stock market dropcould spur further consolidation in the oil patch.    "We know the value is there. The market fluctuation has notchanged the value of the underlying assets," DeCrane saidof publicly traded U.S. oil companies. Reuter&#3;
