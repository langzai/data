Columbia Gas System Inc said aFederal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on naturalgas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25dlrs a share.    The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 belowColumbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrsper share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.    It said management expects to recommend to the board thatthe dividend rate be maintained in 1987.    Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may beoffset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future taxliabilities under the new federal tax laws.    The company recorded these liabilities based on older,higher tax rates, but an action being considered by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain ofabout 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.    "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,"Columbia Gas said.    Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit therecovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia GasTransmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.    It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchasedgas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related toamortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchasecontracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiaryfailed to sufficiently support cost recovery.    The company said its subsidiary is not precluded frommaking a new filing to provide sufficient support. Reuter&#3;
