Finance Minister Palle Simonsen saidtoday's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard andPoor's Corp should not be over-dramatised.    Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom ofDenmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, followingthe country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.    "This change is regrettable but there is no reason todramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor'sdefines the AA category as only slightly different from the topAAA rating," Simonsen said in a statement.    "The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowingcapability is unlikely to be very great. But if, againstexpectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external accountdeficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms andcapability," he added.    "Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a seriesof austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending andencourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.    "If and when it becomes necessary, the government will beready to take any necessary economic and political initiativesas it has in the past," Simonsen said.   Standard and Poor's said weaker internationalcompetitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean adeteriorating current account balance and a rise in externaldebt.    The external current account deficit rose to a recordpreliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns,according to government statistics.    Government economists forecast that the external currentaccount deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.    Denmark's net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exportsin 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said. REUTER&#3;
