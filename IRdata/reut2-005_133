The Bank of Spain said banks must makeprovisions amounting to at least 25 pct of outstanding loans tocountries deemed to be high-risk borrowers.    The measure was included in a package of circulars approvedby governors of the central bank yesterday.    The bank said it was retaining a complex system forcalculating the proportion of loans which must be covered byspecial provisions but added that sudden shifts in thesituation of borrowers had made it advisable to set a minimumlevel of 25 pct for such provisions.    The bank said another measure instructs banks and financialinstitutions to begin setting aside provisions for futurepension obligations.    Banks were obliged last year to ensure that they had madesufficient provisions for current pension obligations and a newcircular sets a maximum time limit of five years to coverfuture obligations.
