Financing talks here between theArgentine government and its bank advisory committee are finelypoised, with the two sides still separated on the criticalquestion of interest-rate spreads, bankers said.    Argentina is pressing for a margin of 13/16 pct over theLondon Interbank Offered Rate, the same rate as on Mexico'srecent new-loan and rescheduling package, but the banks arerefusing, they said.    Negotiations continued in New York today, even thoughFinance Secretary Mario Brodersohn has returned to Argentina toconsult president Raul Alfonsin on the proposed terms.    After the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billiondlr loan, bankers feel that they could not sell a package forArgentina with a margin of 13/16 pct. They are holding out fora spread close to one pct, with 7/8 pct - the rate won byVenezuela and the Philippines - as their rock-bottom offer.    "What they're looking at and what we've got on the tableare not that far apart," one banker said.    Bankers said that Argentina is seeking to stretch outprincipal repayments on upcoming public-sector debt maturitiesfor 19 years and is looking for a 13-year loan from the banksto cover the bulk of its 2.15 billion dlr new-money need.
