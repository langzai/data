Bell Atlantic Corp's Bell ofPennsylvania unit said federal regulators granted it interimpermission to sell regulated telecommunications networkservices along with equipment provided by an unregulated BellAtlantic unit.    In January, the Federal Communications Commission ruledthat Bell telephone companies could sell their telephoneservices in tandem with equipment provided by their unregulatedequipment units.    But the FCC stipulated that the Bell companies must complywith new accounting rules that separate the costs of regulatedtelephone service from those of unregulated businesses.    Bell of Pennsylvnia said the FCC gave it interim relief tojointly market services and equipment until its accounting planis approved by the commission. Reuter&#3;
