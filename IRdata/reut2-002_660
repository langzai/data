The central bank recommended a majorchange in the traditional ownership structure of Swedishcommercial banks that bankers said would inevitably lead to thetakeover of remaining small regional banks.    The recommendation was prompted by a recent proposal by the&lt;Proventus> financial group to create a new holding companythat will control the third-largest commercial bank &lt;Gotabankenand Wermlandsbanken>, a small regional bank.    The central bank gave its approval and said financialgroups should be allowed to have banking subsidiaries as longas the groups did not include industrial or trading companies.    The central bank was commenting on a proposed new billgoverning Swedish financial groups.    It recommended that insurance companies should not beallowed to own banks until a separate inquiry into the problemwas completed. Sweden's two biggest insurance companies haveboth said they would like to enter the banking business.    Sweden's commercial banks on the other hand have longwanted to buy up insurance companies.    Bankers said the recommendations would mainly bring therules up to date with new circumstances created by theextensive de-regulation of the Swedish financial markets since1982.    Bankers said it was clear that others would follow theProventus example and that this would lead to a shake-up in thebanking system with the remaining small regional banks beingabsorbed by larger banking groups.    The central bank also recommended banks be allowed tooperate their stockbroking departments as subsidiaries, whichbankers said would lead to banks taking over small stockbrokingfirms. Banks have long complained the ban on splitting off thebroking departments forced them to operate at a disadvantagebecause they could not match the partnerships and largesalaries stockbrokers could offer their staff.
