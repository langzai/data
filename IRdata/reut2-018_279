Widespread, soaking rains aided cropdevelopment across the province, with the northwest cropproducing region receiving the most precipitation, according tothe Manitoba Agriculture weekly crop report.

Plantings were virtually complete across the province andgermination was well advanced. However, some fields stillshowed spotty stands.    Cereal crops in the southwest were 90 pct germinated, withsome fields already in the subsequent tillering stage, it said.Oilseeds in the northwest region were about 80 pct emerged inmany areas, with other regions 50 to 70 pct emerged.
