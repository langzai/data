He told a conference organised by the Development Bank ofSingapore Ltd that Singapore wants to develop the fixed ratesecurities market. He said a state securities market, along thesame lines as the U.S. Government securities market, will bedeveloped to provide a benchmark for corporate bonds.    Teo said the fixed rate securities market will pave the wayfor companies to raise fixed rate funds.    Referring to a proposed change in the broking commissionstructure, Teo said the exchange is likely to introduce asliding scale structure instead of a negotiated commissionstructure. He said the negotiated structure works against smallinvestors, who play an important role in the market.    The market capitalisation of the Stock Exchange ofSingapore increased to 42 billion U.S. Dlrs in January 1987from 32 billion U.S. Dlrs in early 1986, he said.    Teo said the government has picked 15 companies toparticipate in a privatisation program which strives to createopportunities for investors through the sale of 380 mln dlrsworth of shares a year. It will try to increase alternativeinvestment available to investors, he said.    He cautioned against problems in a more competitivesecurities market, adding that the possibility of insidertrading is increased when securities dealing, corporate financeand investment advisory functions are conducted under one roof.But he said the future direction of Singapore's securitiesindustry will be dictated by international trends.
