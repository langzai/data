The U.S. economy in March improved at afaster rate than in February, with the National Association ofPurchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from51.9 pct, the NAPM said.    The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for therest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross nationalproduct growth of about three pct.    An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that theeconomy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies adeclining economy.    The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in allof the indicators in the index except inventories, whichdeclined slightly.    New orders rose sharply in March, with production alsohigher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economyimproved in March. Employment expanded for the first time sinceAugust 1984.    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business surveycommittee and director of materials management at Pitney BowesInc &lt;PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with ahealthy, if not substantial improvement."    Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders inMarch assures a good beginning for the second quarter.    Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that theywere paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Ofthose paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at2.5 pct.    The estimated average price increase anticipated by membersfor the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue torise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them asbeing significant.    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, basedon five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.    The monthly report is based on questions asked ofpurchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies. Reuter&#3;
