The Commerce Department said thatall Canadian firms had begun to pay an agreed to 15 pctsurcharge on softwood shipped to U.S. markets.    It made the statement after talks with Canadian officialsabout press reports and speculation in Canada that someexporters were not paying the charge.    Canada and the United States agreed last December to the 15pct charge, ending a lengthy trade dispute over allegedCanadian subsidies to Canada's softwood exporters.    Commerce officials would not say if they found any Canadiancompanies had been evading the charge, but that following thetalks they were convinced all exporters were complying with theagreement.    Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said "We aregratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun payingthe export charge on lumber."    He added the agreement was important to the health of theU.S. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fullycarried out. reuter&#3;
