Strikes against a government freeze onwages spread to most regions of Yugoslavia last week, theofficial news agency Tanjug said last night.    It said thousands of workers were involved, and officialsfeared more strikes were on the way.    At least 60 strikes have taken place around Yugoslavia inthe past two weeks, but most of those previously reported werein the northern republic of Croatia.    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic imposed the wage freeze lastmonth in an effort to curb rampant inflation, now running at anannual rate of almost 100 pct.    The government froze wages at their level in the fourthquarter of 1986 and said any future rises must be linked toproductivity.    The measure met widespread disapproval. Even some seniorexecutives of major industrial enterprises have criticised thefreeze in interviews with Tanjug.    The agency said strikes took place last week in thesouthern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnicAlbanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosniaand Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers inBelgrade refused to take their paychecks. Reuter&#3;
