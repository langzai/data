The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreignexchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, abank spokesman said.    "We have now cleared three auctions and are left with onlyfour, worth eight mln dlrs," the spokesman said withoutspecifying the amount paid out.    The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firmssince it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28.    It has said the auctions were suspended because it plannedto introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund.    President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that theauction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange toapproved private sector bidders, but would not be used todetermine the kwacha's exchange rate.    Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble becauseof a shortage of foreign exchange.    The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwachaper dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct. REUTER&#3;
