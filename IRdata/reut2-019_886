The Federal Home Loan Bank Board saidit closed down the insolvent United Federal Savings and LoanAssociation of Durant, Okla, and turned its insured depositsand other assets and liabilities over to a newly created,federally chartered thrift.    It said the failed thrift's four offices would reopentomorrow under Bank Board management.    United, with assets of 9.31 mln dlrs, was closed because ithad substantially dissipated its assets and earnings due tofederal law violations and unsafe and unsound practices, thethrift regulatory agency said.    The Bank Board faulted the failed thrift for its largeholdings of substandard loans made in 1984-85 due to "imprudentunderwriting policies and controls on loans for constructionand other purposes throughout the United States."
