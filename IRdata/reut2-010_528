The United States said it was doingwhat it could to ease tension in the Aegean as Greek andTurkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drillingrights on the sea's continental shelf.    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters,"We have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid anyactions which might exacerbate the situation."    "In the light of the most recent developments, we areconsulting with the parties and with other interested allies onmeans to reduce tensions," he added.    Redman declined to elaborate on what Washington was doing,but he said an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors inBrussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing.    He also refused to say which side was to blame for therenewed confrontation, saying Washington was still trying toascertain all the facts, as Prime minister Andreas Papanderousaid Greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor.    "The crucial point here is that these are two friends andallies. We don't want to see tension rise and we are doing whatwe can to see if we can help here," Redman said. Reuter&#3;
