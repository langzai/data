Treasurer Paul Keating said theopposition's tax-cutting policy, a key issue in the run up tothe July 11 elections, was a miscalculation that would severelydamage the Australian economy.    Opposition leader John Howard disputed Keating'sallegations. "Keating is engaged in a desperate, last ditchpanic attempt to deny long-suffering Australian taxpayers thecuts to which they are entitled," he said.    Keating said in a radio interview that errors in Howard'splan, including "double counting," would increase the budgetdeficit and could push interest rates above 20 pct.    Keating said that Treasury officials who had studiedHoward's plans concluded that his proposed tax and spendingcuts would result in a nine billion dlr deficit and damageinternational market confidence in Australia.    In his mini-budget on May 13 Keating said the budgetdeficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two andthree billion dlrs.    Howard has said a conservative government under hisleadership would reduce the 55 pct top personal and company taxlevel to 38 pct and fund the reduction by cutting governmentspending.    Keating and Prime Minister Bob Hawke have promised not toincrease taxes or impose new ones, but rejected any tax cuts.Instead they called for wage and other economic restraints tohelp overcome balance of payments and foreign debt problems.    Inflation declined to 9.4 pct for the year to March 31 froman annual 9.8 pct at the end of the December quarter.    Hawke has said inflation would fall to six pct by themiddle of next year.    Australian bank lending rates to best customers havedropped to around 16.5 pct from a high of 19 pct nine monthsago. REUTER&#3;
