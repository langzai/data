Consul Restaurant Corp said it beganan exchange offer for its 13 pct convertible debentures due1992 with an aggregate principal amount of 17.5 mln dlrs.    Consul officials told an analysts meeting that in returnfor each 1,000 dlr face value of the bonds tendered, investorswill receive 10 shares of preferred stock convertible after Dec1, 1987, into 500 shares of common. The company said the valuerepresents a substantial premium over the debentures' marketvalue, which traded at 410 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face amount onMarch 13.    Consul said the debt was taken on to finance expansion.    James Crivits, Consul chairman, said debt service on theoutstanding debentures has cost the company 55 cts a share perquarter and cut deeply into the company's profitability.    For the year ended May 31, 1986, the company reported a netloss of 1.12 dlr per share or 5.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 77.6mln dlrs.    Crivits said the company will report an improved but stillunprofitable third quarter ended February 28, compared to aloss of 22 cts a share in the year-ago thrid quarter. He saidcurrent third quarter results would be similar to 1987'ssecond quarter's loss of 12 cts per share.    Crivits said the company will not produce a gain in thefourth quarter or the full year, and said there will be a writeoff in the fourth quarter for the debenture exchange offer. Hewould not specify the amount of the write off.    Robert Lamp, Consul's chief financial officer, said thecompany needs to have at least 90 pct of the bonds exchanged inthe transaction to report a profit in the first quarter offiscal 1988. Lamp said that if the exchange is successful, thecompany will report profits much higher than the three cents ashare reported in the first quarter of fiscal 1987.    The Minneapolis-based company, which it said is thenation's largest franchisee of Chi-Chi's family-style Mexicanrestaurants, said it had the planned to expand to 80 units, buthad to abandon the effort, leaving 38 units in operation.    The company also said the restaurants are profitable, withprofit margins increasing over last year. Reuter&#3;
