The thrift was owned by Texas businessman Donald Dixon, whobought it in early 1982, when it had only 120 mln dlrs inassets.    The bank board said growth was accomplished largely throughthe purchase of brokered deposits and the sale of jumbocertificates of deposit, which totaled 29 pct of total depositsat the end of 1986.    The bank board also said that 96 pct of its loan portfoliowas nonperforming as a result of sloppy loan practices.
