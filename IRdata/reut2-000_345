Apple Computer Inc today willannounce the addition of two new machines to its profitableMacintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at thebusiness market.    The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and hasbeen upgraded several times since then. Both of the newmachines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be fasterand more versatile, but considerably more expensive thanearlier models.    The Mac SE (SE stands for "system expansion"), which Applesays will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus,goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price rangingfrom 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.    The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster thanthe Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and pricedbetween 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.    Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells forabout 2,200 dlrs.    Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorldConference in Los Angeles.    Company officials expressed high hopes for both computersat a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performanceMac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to theexpanding market for science and engineering workstations.    John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer,declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SEshould contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line thisyear. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.    "I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice formost people," he said. "My sense is that it will be a realpower product for revenue."    Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp;Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computersbut expected the new products to do well.    "Apple has recognized the need for a convergence ofcomputer functions into one general all-purpose workstation,"he told Reuters. "The graphics interface on the Mac products issignificantly better than anything IBM has to date."    International Business Machines is expected to announceupdated personal computers this spring.    The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an"open architecture" that allows for the addition of numerousperipheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte ofmemory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped witha 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor.    In a demonstration of its speed and power, companyexecutives said they thought the Mac II would push thedevelopment of software for Apple computers in new directionsthat could include sophisticated video editing, electronic mailsystems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use.    The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256colors or shades of gray.    The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor andwill be shipped with one megabyte RAM, expandable to fourmegabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen.    Both new computers have two optional keyboards, a newfeature in the Apple line of products.           Reuter&#3;
