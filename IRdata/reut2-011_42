Texton Inc said it intends torepay a substantial portion of the debt generated to acquireEx-Cell-O Corp last year through internally generated cash andproceeds from the sale of assets.    Textron financed the acquisition by borrowing about onebillion dlrs under promissory notes, subsequently refinancedthrough the sale of commercial paper and bank borrowings.    The large diversified conglomerate with operations rangingfrom defense to consumer and financial services, said in itsannual report that it has not yet identified the units, otherthan its Gorham division, it expects to sell.    Textron said it did expect to identify the units it intendsto sell during the next year. It said the sales are expected toreduce income from continuing operations as the units' earningswill exceed the interest on the debt retired with the proceedsof the sales.    It also said it plans to "return to a more conservativebalance sheet ratio of debt-to-capital," through asset salesand increasing cash flow from continuing operations.    It also said it will continue to examine "large acquisitionopportunities," while "pruning" operations no longer expectedto meet its strategic requirements. Reuter&#3;
