Australia's largest company, The BrokenHill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a netprofit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the firstnine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuterssaid.    This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in thefirst three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 311986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.    The analysts estimated that the group would report a thirdquarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.    BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amountedto 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn inpetroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflectingsome improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Straitfields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral andsteel earnings.    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coalprices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has beenaffected by industrial and production problems.    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP'slowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around300 mln dlrs.    One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be atax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance oncapital expenditure in the steel division, they said.    They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it wouldbe difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit. REUTER&#3;
