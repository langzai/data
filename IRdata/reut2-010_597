A top level political reshufflefollowing the January removal of Communist Party chief HuYaobang will take place at a party conference later this year,Vice-Premier Yao Yilin said Saturday.    Yao told a news conference Zhao Ziyang would go on holdingthe jobs of Premier and acting Communist Party chief until the13th party congress, due to be held by October.    Yao gave the news conference in the Great Hall of thePeople along with Vice-Premiers Li Peng and Tian Jiyun, the twomain contenders to succeed Zhao as Premier.    Western diplomats say Li, a technocrat who studied in theSoviet Union, is the most likely successor.    Li appeared to go out of his way to deny any specialsympathy with Moscow. In answer to questions, he said he hadnever met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev when both studied inthe Soviet Union in the 1950s and had since met him on only twooccasions, both of which had been reported in the news media.    Asked what China could learn fromn the Soviet economicsystem, Li said the main lesson was to avoid excessivecentralism and rigid control over economic activities.    "We do not totally reject the planned economy, but we areopposed to rigid control in the planned economy which hampersinitiative and enthusiasm of the grassroots enterprise," Lisaid.    On Taiwan, Yao repeated Chinese policy of not ruling outforce to regain the nationalist-ruled island, but did notrepeat an official statement earlier this week that the goalwas to achieve reunification by the year 2000. "As forreunification, it is our hope that it will be achieved throughpeaceful means, but we have not eliminated the possibility oftaking non-peaceful means to achieve that process," he said.
