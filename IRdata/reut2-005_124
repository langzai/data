A decision by Colombia to open coffeeexport registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply thecountry will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld,Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'association, told Reuters.    Colombia today opened export registrations for april andmay, with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting nolimit.    Since the start of the coffee year last october, privateexporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos permonth.    "Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcingheavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it willquickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to goover the top," Arango said in an interview.    "Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste butconsistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will reactto market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to giveits coffee away," he added.    Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, includinga lower export registration price, as a major change inColombia's coffee marketing policy.    The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).    The government announced a more flexible policy ofreintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, whicharango warmly welcomed saying private exporters willundoubtedly be more actively present in the market.    A frequent gap between international market prices and thereintegro was unlikely to recur, he said. Reuter&#3;
