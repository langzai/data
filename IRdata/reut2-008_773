Robert Heller, a member of the Boardof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said commodityprices could form a useful guide for setting domestic andinternational monetary policy.    Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Hellersaid, "A broadly based commodity price index may be worthexploring" as a guide to monetary policy.    "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy mightbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetarypolicy might be eased," he said.    Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurementproblems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give"early warning" signs of wholesale and retail changes.    "There is no need to react to every small fluctuation incommodity prices or to do so on a daily basis," Heller said in aprepared text.    "But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policyaction might be considered," he said.    Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as anindicator for monetary policy would also contribute tostabilized currency exchange rates.    Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and pricesfor them are more consistent than for other types of goods, hesaid.    He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilizeexport commodity prices for developing countries by using acommodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy. Reuter&#3;
