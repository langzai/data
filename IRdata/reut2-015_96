Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries. Reuter&#3;
