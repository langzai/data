The wet, cold weather which has shroudednorthern Europe recently is not a real problem for farmers yet,a spokeswoman for France's largest farm union, FNSEA, said.    The bad weather has only affected the northern part ofFrance while the Mediterranean region needs more moisture.    Sugar beet producers said the climatic conditions are notcausing them any difficulties yet although there could beproblems if there is a lack of sun in the next few weeks.    The only real problem is for fruit producers in the northas people are consuming less fresh fruit and excessive rainrots the crop, she said. Reuter&#3;
