Canada's Minister of State for Finance,Tom Hockin, said substantial progress was made today with hisprovincial counterparts on deregulation of the country'sfinancial system, but stumbling blocks remain.    "We were able to make considerable headway," Hockin toldreporters following a six-hour meeting with provincialministers responsible for financial institutions.    Hockin said he was optimistic an agreement could be reachedby the June 30 deadline to bring the sweeping new system inplace, but he was willing to extend it if necessary.    Under the proposed system the traditional barriersseparating the banking, securities and life insurance sectorswill be removed and, for the first time, cross ownership willbe allowed.    But a jurisdictional dispute over who regulates the newinstitutions has broken out between the provinces and Ottawa.The provinces have traditionally had authority over securitieswhile Ottawa held sway over banking.    Hockin, without giving details, said under the new systemthe regulatory system would have to be harmonized to "insureorderly and efficient markets."    Hockin said he made it clear to the provinces that Ottawahas jurisdiction in any international accords in the financialsector and would not allow any intrusion by the provinces inthat area.    Hockin said the ministers did not have time to go intodetail on all the issues and the talks would continue the restof this week at the official level.                  Reuter&#3;
