Spain's General Union of Workers (UGT),the trade union arm of the Socialist party, will keep pressingfor salary rises of seven pct despite governmentrecommendations for a five pct ceiling, a UGT spokesman said.    Trade union sources said coal mines in Asturias remainedclosed by protests against planned job cuts. A 24-hour stoppageat the state railways RENFE, coinciding with strikes at twoairlines next Friday, was virtually certain to be confirmed.They said construction workers would start a five-day strikenext week.    Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez last night sought supportfor his call to limit wage rises in an effort to cut inflationto five pct from 8.3 pct last year. He told a press conferencethe Socialist government could not meet all demands and wouldnot yield to demagogy.    Antonio Hernandez Mancha, leader of the main oppositionright-wing Popular Alliance (AP) party which tabled a motion ofno confidence against the government, said Gonzalez had run outof imagination. But political sources said the government,holding an absolute majority in parliament, is sure to survivethe no confidence debate opening tomorrow. REUTER&#3;
