Coffee producing countries must quicklymap out a fresh common strategy following the failure of theInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement onexport quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's privatecoffee exporters' association, said.    Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing nowwould be to seek a unifying stand from producers, includingBrazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.    An ICO special meeting ended last night in London withexporting and consuming nations failing to agree on aresumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago afterprices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.    Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe butpredicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedlyplummet.    However, he said the market should also take into accountevident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of thenear totality of the Central American crop.    Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past10 years.    Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understandthe true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nationsas well as for industrialized countries.    It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made tosolve the problem of the developing world's external debt,decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repayingthose debts, he said.    "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countrieswhich support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"Cardenas said.
