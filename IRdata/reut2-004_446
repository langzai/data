Defense Secretary Caspar Weinbergerwill join Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige in fightingFujitsu Ltd's &lt;ITSU.T> plan to buy 80 pct of &lt;FairchildSemiconductor Corp>, Pentagon officials said.    "He (Weinberger) opposes it. It is not in the best interestsof the country to have more of the micro-electronics businessleaving the United States," one of the Pentagon officials, whoasked not to be identified, told Reuters.    Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday thatBaldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White HouseEconomic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.    Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinbergerfeared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily onforeign electronic support.    But the Defense Department also said today that Weinbergerand Baldrige differed on the proposed sale of U.S. computerequipment to Iran.    The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently thatdefense objections to two proposed sales -- to an Iranian powercompany and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency -- werenot valid and the sales of small and medium computers would gothrough unless more evidence was presented.
