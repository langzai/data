Coopervision Inc said it ispreparing a recapitalization plan, which includes a commonstock repurchase program and an exchange of debt securities forcommon stock.    The plan, along with a proposal to change its name toCooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval atthe company's annual meeting on June 22.    The meeting had been postponed from its original date ofMay 14 in order to let management review recapitalizationoptions, it said.    In addition, Coopervision said operating income in itscurrent fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show animprovement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs andits year ago quarter.    Income from continuing operations was not immediatelyavailalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which itreported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.    At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previouslyannounced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense forshareholders.    He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to itssecond quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of hisposition.    "The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky soldhis position and has never recovered," Montgomery said. Thecompany's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.    Montgomery further told the conference, "Don't be aninvestor in the stock on the basis of any short term recoveryin operating or net income in 1987 and 1988."    "Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing marketshare in our core businesses this year and next, regardless ofthe impact to the bottom line," he said. Reuter&#3;
