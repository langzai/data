The French inflation rate is expected toshow a substantial improvement in February after January's veryhigh 0.9 pct monthly rate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladursaid.    He told a French television interviewer that half of thehigh January rise, which took year on year inflation that monthto three pct, was due to higher oil prices.    "Now, taking account of this inflation index, our forecastfor price rises this year is two and a half pct," he said.    Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target,which the government had initially set at two pct for thisyear, should not affect wage expectations for this year.    "There is no reason to envisage a change in our wage policy,"he said, referring to the government's aim of holding publicsector wage increases to three pct this year.    Price inflation last year fell to 2.1 pct from 4.7 pct in1985. REUTER&#3;
