U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker saidany attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major LatinAmerican debtor nations might damage the world economy.    In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald,Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief,calling it a "dramatic, overnight solution."    "While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have somepolitical appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive inthe long run," he said.    The article was published to coincide with a three-daymeeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).    Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on ThirdWorld debt.    Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor, last monthdeclared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given noindication of when it may resume interest payments, promptingfears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantialdebt writedowns and calling into question the viability of theU.S. Strategy.    Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercialbanks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt sinceOctober 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.    "Together with expected progress in commercial bankdiscussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this shouldadd up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtorsin 1987," Baker wrote.    He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accountedfor 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's majordebtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sellThird World debt at a discount to investors who then becomestockholders in firms in these countries. "These swaps aren't apanacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market canmake progress in reducing the debt burden," he said. REUTER&#3;
