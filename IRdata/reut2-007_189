Deputy Assistant Treasury SecretaryJames Conrow said he was exceedingly pessimistic that 1988funding for the multilateral development banks, as proposed bythe Reagan administration, will be approved by Congress.    Speaking to an international development conference, Conrowsaid it appears almost certain Congress will opt to cutspending for international programs before they cut intodomestic programs.    He said in such an environment "foreign aid will lose andlose big."    The administration has proposed development bank funding of1.8 billion dlrs for fiscal year 1988 and seeks about 290 mlndlrs in catch-up from funding reduced in prior years.   Reuter&#3;
