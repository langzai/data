World group turnover of Siemens AG&lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the currentyear to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first fivemonths, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.    Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02billion marks.    Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly dueto payment in January for a West German nuclear power stationwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.    In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed athree pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise betweenone and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, thecommunications and telecommunications sectors in particularshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of thedollar, Kaske said.    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 groupnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in thesame period in the previous year.    Turnover in the first five months rose particularlystrongly in the installations and automotive technology,communications and telecommunications sectors, but componentsand energy and automation showed a sharp decline.    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks inthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above theirlevel in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular byorders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. Anincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroadwas balanced by the decline in the dollar.    While the installations and automotive technology sectorshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation andcommunications orders were below the level achieved in the sameperiod of 1985/86.    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the samelevel.    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around sixbillion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previousyear. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover. REUTER&#3;
