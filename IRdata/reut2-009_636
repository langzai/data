The European Community (EC) considerstalks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talkson other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy deClercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.    He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure toreach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.    He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year scheduleagreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That includedagricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in thelengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.    Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATTround include reform of trade in merchandise and services.    De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-dayconference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.    Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what theysaw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called forurgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,also said it was important agreement on agricultural tradereform was reached as early as possible.    But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached afterlong and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.    "We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,and that was very clear -- that the new round would be oneundertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, nofast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -and that's all," de Clercq said.    "If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not mypriority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not theonly urgent thing," he said.    He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight monthsto prepare and eight days of negotiations. REUTER&#3;
