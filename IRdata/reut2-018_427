Next year is likely to see a shortfallin zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although thereshould be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltdmetals analyst Stephen Briggs said.    Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metalsconference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 wasthe imminent cessation of new mining and termination of millingat Pine Point in Canada.    However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.    Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there wasunlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one ofrecord production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipatedin Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacityin South Korea.    "Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are alsoexpected in 1987," Briggs said.    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levelsat existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied withachievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faroin Canada.    Looking further forward, the major event was the probableopening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacityof 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.    "Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that therewill be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s," headded.    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that ofzinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and thereforesupply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products fromzinc mines.    "On this basis, our calculations point to a modestoversupply of lead concentrates in 1987," Briggs said.    The copper forecast, however, was for a recordnon-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.    Production of primary refined copper metal would alsoincrease, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading toa moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnesthis year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of thedecade, he said.
