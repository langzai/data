Doctors at the Centers for DiseaseControl in Atlanta said they have new evidence that birthcontrol pills can help provide long-term protection from cancerof the ovary, even if the pills are only taken for a fewmonths.     The study, reported in the New England Journal ofMedicine, also found that all the various types of oralcontraceptives on the market were equally effective in loweringthe rate of ovarian cancer.     The researchers estimated that the use of birth controlpills in this country probably prevented about 1,700 cases ofovarian cancer in 1982.    As more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives"move into the age groups that are at highest risk forepithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidenceof this serious disease," they said.     Specifically, the team led by Dr. Howard Ory found that"oral contraceptive use, even for a few months, reduces therisk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to54 years of age.     "The effect probably takes from five to ten years tobecome apparent, but it persists long after the use of oralcontraceptives ends. Moreover, protection exists regardless ofthe formulation of oral contraceptive used," they said. Reuter&#3;
