The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tenderoffer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not beenough to buy the company, analysts said.    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from GeneralPartners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value ofGenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertaintysurrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges toGencorp broadcasting licenses.    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.    "The expectation is either there will be someone else orthe bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management'scooperation," said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Huttongroup.    Analysts said there is concern about challenges toGencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radiostations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign paymentsand political contributions.    "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,"said Baker of the offer.    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issuemight be a stumbling block or result in a long period of timefor any transaction.    A source close to General Partners, however, said GeneralPartners would apply to the Federal Communications Commissionfor special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.The source said if approved, the authority would allow atransaction to be carried out.    If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partnerswould set up a trust which would hold the broadcastingproperties until the licensing situation is resolved.    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner andBrown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such asGeneral Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution ofthe challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sellthe stations.    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with WaltDisney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to agroup that challenged the station's license.    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV inSecaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.    General Partners said it intends to keep the company'splastics and industrial products businesses and its tires andrelated products segment.    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidthat, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth asmuch as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospacebusiness could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billiondlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs pershare, he said.    The company, formerly known as General Tireand Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would beworth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottlingbusiness might also be worth several dollars per share, hesaid.    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, whobecame chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company'sAerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over theyears and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.    "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to dealwith the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said.    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, butthey declined to predict what steps the company might take.They said it would be possible the company might consider aleveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and therewas some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment ata premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.    "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothingsurprises me anymore," said Rose.    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retainedFirst Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.    Reuter&#3;
