Negotiations resumed in the 14-day-oldstrike by Canada's letter carriers and picket line violencesubsided after the federal government changed its mind andappointed a mediator.    The talks between the 20,000-member Letter Carriers Unionof Canada and government-owned Canada Post were the first sinceLabor Minister Pierre Cadieux announced the appointment of amediator yesterday.       There had been little progress between the parties lastweek and both sides requested a mediator for the second time.Cadieux originally said the two sides were too far apart towarrant the help on an independent third party.    Although the postal union said it would maintain itsstrategy of selected rotating strikes across the country, onlythe Montreal area was affected today and service was normalelsewhere in Canada.       Canada Post stuck by its promise to halt the use ofreplacement workers for at least seven days if a mediator wasappointed and there were no reports of picket line violence.    Canada Post, under government orders to eliminate a $160million (U.S.) deficit by next year, has taken a tough stand inthe talks and the two sides remain far apart on wages andworking conditions.
