Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said DennisLevine's conviction for insider trading showed the need fortougher enforcement of insider trading laws by the governmentand the securities industry.    Lent's comments came at the start of closed testimony byLevine at the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee.Levine's testimony was not released.    "Why didn't Dennis Levine's superiors at four differentinvestment banking houses question the sources of his 'uncanny'information on possible corporate takeovers?" Lent asked.    "Why has the Securities and Exchange Commission historicallybeen unable to prosecute insider trading cases without outsideevidence that illegal behavior has taken place?" Lent added.    Lent said Levine had told the subcommittee staff hisassociates at major banks told him insider trading was acceptedpractice. Levine also said he did not worry about being caughtby the SEC.    "The securities industry must stop putting morality andethics behind proift. The SEC must exercise tougher control andsupervision of the industry," Lent said. Reuter&#3;
