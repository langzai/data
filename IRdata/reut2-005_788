Norway's parliament has approved anextensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners akey loophole through which controversial oil shipments onNorwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.    The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until lateSeptember to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.    Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa onNorwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exceptionfor ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. Asoil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said thedoor will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.    Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pctof its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the tradehas dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,trade ministry officials said.    The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from SouthAfrica dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eightmonths of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crownsfrom the year-ago figure.    The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house forformal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said. REUTER&#3;
