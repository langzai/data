Insects are threatening to destroy367,000 hectares or about one-third of the spring rice crop innorthern Vietnam, Hanoi radio reported.    Drought has hit another 189,000 hectares, with 40,000hectares very badly affected, it said.    Insecticides are in short supply so only the mostendangered rice fields should be sprayed, the radio added.    The affected areas -- the Red River delta and other coastalareas in northern Vietnam -- produce between 30 to 40 per centof the country's rice.    The radio report, monitored in Bangkok on April 20 but onlytranslated here over the weekend, said the threatened damagewas spread over twice as large an area as last year.    Vietnam has not been able to grow enough food for itsexpanding population, with the Soviet Union buying rice inThailand and Burma in recent years for supply to Vietnam.    Vietnam produced 18.2 million tonnes of food, most of itrice, last year and hopes to boost that to 23-24 million tonnesby 1990. REUTER&#3;
