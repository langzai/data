The Fried. Krupp GmbH&lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar'sweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials pricefalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery andplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineeringbusiness achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions hadunderpinned machinery and component activities.    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, thetrading and services sectors, affected the group's total orderfigures.    However, "all business sectors contributed to the positiveresults achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details.    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marksfrom the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct oforders against 40 pct in 1985.    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11member companies which comprise the core area of the group,rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks atend-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased bythree pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration inforeign trade and a downturn in a number of customerindustries.    The difficult market for sections and flats of qualitysteel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainlesscold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.
