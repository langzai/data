Cocoa futures stood hardly changed fromlast night at midday with near July last traded at yesterday'soffered level of 1,318 stg from a 1,324 high, dealers said.    Overnight steadiness in New York was balanced by firmsterling versus the dollar and continued availability of WestAfrican new crop physical offers, notably Ghana and Ivory.    The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1,325French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was offering around1,460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar, dealers said.    Volume midday was 1,013 lots including 130 crosses.    Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in thenear future, the only other bullish feature on the immediatehorizon is the recently lower trade forecast for Bahia'stemporao crop which ranged between 1.5 and 2.0 mln bags from2.0 to 2.5 mln bags previously and compared with initialexpectations of three mln bags, dealers said.    Some traders are now saying the temporao is more likely tobe near the lower end of the new range although this could beoffset by a higher than expected Ivory Coast mid-crop.    Resale physicals were quiet although light enquiry wasseen, the dealers said. REUTER&#3;
