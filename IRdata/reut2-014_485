Securities Commissioner Ray Astin andChairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ronald Li said in ajoint statement they have rejected a plan by Jardine MathesonHoldings Ltd &lt;JARD.HK> to list its new "B" shares and that othersuch plans will not be approved.    They said the move resulted from recognition of thepotential disadvantages of listing "B" shares and from strongopposition by stock brokers and members of the exchange.    They also noted both Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd &lt;CKGH.HK>and associate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK> have agreed towithdraw previously announced plans to issue "B" shares.    The Cheung Kong firms each announced bonus issues of onenew "B" share for each two ordinary shares last week after aproposed four-for-one bonus issue of "B" shares by Jardine.    The stock exchange then barred any further issues of "B"shares, except the three proposals already submitted. The "B"shares have equal voting rights with existing shares but a muchlower par value.
