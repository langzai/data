Paul Volcker's decision not to go for athird term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination ofAlan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns aboutthe U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stemrising inflation, financial market analysts said.    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflationfighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing inthe U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enoughpolitical clout and monetary experience to wage a toughcampaign against inflation over the next year or two.    "The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal withinflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of NikkoSecurities Co International Inc and former staff director formonetary and financial policy at the Fed.    "A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker'sdeparture. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets willremain nervous," added Stephen Slifer, money market economistat Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.    This morning's announcement sent the dollar into atailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bankintervention in the open currency market. Reuter&#3;
