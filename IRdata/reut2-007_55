Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pctdrop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that,in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cutits payout to 33 francs per share from 38.    President Robert Staubli told a news conference that thefirst two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit wouldat least equal last year's figure, but said much depended onoutside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.    The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss onSwissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of27 mln francs the previous year, he said.    The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francsin 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended onthe speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.    Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.    Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mlnfrancs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45mln francs supplementary depreciation.    Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions madethis time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange ratefluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.    While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop inthe dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuelprices, there was no such offset for the strength of the francagainst other European currencies.    "Income and profit generated by services to these countriesshrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange ratetrends therefore hit us much more severely than most otherairlines." Reuter&#3;
