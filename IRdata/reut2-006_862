About 9,000 miners employed by thestate corporation Comibol went on hunger strike to press forhigher wages, a miners union spokesman said.     Victor Lopez, executive secretary of the miners union,told a news conference the strikers began to fast in the majortin mining districts of oruro and potosi and the action wouldspread tomorrow to la paz and other areas.     The government has charged that the strike by the minersunion, crippled by massive layoffs, is part of a left-wingdestabilisation plan to coincide with the visit of West Germanpresident Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives on a four-dayofficial tour on Friday.     But miners union chief Simon Reyes told reporters thestrike had nothing to do with subversion and was to press formore government investment in Comibol.     The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro hasstreamlined the deficit-ridden state mining corporation layingoff about 20,000 miners, two-thirds of the workforce, followinga collapse of the international tin price in 1985.
