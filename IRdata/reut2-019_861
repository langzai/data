Citicorp has extended its reachinto the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisitionof 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S> Sears Savings Bank branches,bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,CitiCorp Savings said.    Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by theFederal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and showsits serious intent to penetrate the California market.    The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach intoSouthern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.    "This marks our first major expansion in California,particularly in the south," said Citicorp Savings PresidentEdward Valencia, in a statement.    Thrift industry sources said they do not see a majornear-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, butdo expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor thanSears was in that market.    "We do believe they will be a better competitor thanSears," said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of HomeFederal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego.    Banking industry sources said the move is viewed asgroundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the Californiamarket, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it tooperate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely toconvert the branches to banks at that time.    In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billiondlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force inthe thrift market, against such large California thrifts asHome Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF>, H F Ahmansonand Co &lt;AHM>, Golden West  Financial &lt;GWD> and Great AmericanFirst Savings Bank &lt;GTA>.
