American Telephone and Telegraph Co saidit has developed superconducting wires that can easily beformed into coils.    It said when cooled to 91 degrees Kelvin, or 296 degreesbelow zero Fahrenheit, the wires conduct electricity withoutresistance.    ATT said the wires are made of a barium-yttrium-copperoxide compound.  It said while many engineering details remainto be worked out, "The ability to draw the material into finewire and to wind the wire into coils and other forms is key formany superconductor applications now being considered."
