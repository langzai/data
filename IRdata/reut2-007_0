Media group John Fairfax Ltd &lt;FFXA.S>said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected theimpact of changes in the Australian tax system.    Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mlna year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30mln from 44.29 mln.    Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase incompany tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax onfringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, thecompany said in a statement.    Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenuegrowth in the television industry as another reason for theflat first half earnings.    It said it considered the result satisfactory in view ofthese factors.    Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney MorningHerald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, asdid the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremelysatisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.    But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0pct rise in revenue, it said.    Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to netearnings because group borrowings were reduced following thereceipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from &lt;AustralianAssociated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's "B"shares in Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L>.    This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.    Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for thefull year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlracquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbournewill hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens inSydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.
