Major cocoa exporters are likely tolimit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost worldprices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa ProducersAlliance (CPA) said.    The sources said the depressed world market had been one ofthe main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the11-member CPA which began on Monday.    They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid thebuffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in hiseffort to support prices.    Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreedoperation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in Londonlast month and the stock manager is expected to enter themarket soon.    Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoasurpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager hasto buy cocoa under stock rules.    The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set rangeby buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.    "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.    Another source said that with much of the 1986/87(October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales inthe near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.    The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry inBrazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major WestAfrican producers, where sales are made or authorized bycommodity marketing boards.    The CPA includes the world's top three producers, IvoryCoast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.    The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening. Reuter&#3;
