The European Community is willing tooffer limited concessions to the United States on one of twomajor issues which threaten to poison their trade relationsnext year, an EC commission spokesman said.    He said the offer would be made at a meeting later thismonth between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and ECExternal Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq.    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agricultureministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to makesome temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S.Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fedwith growth hormones, the spokesman said.    Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the ECproceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countriesdo not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to themakers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S.Manufacturers.    It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and willrob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.    Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting willtake place in London and will also involve the aerospaceministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, thecountries involved in the Airbus project.
