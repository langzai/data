Taiwan and the U.S. Have revised andextended their textile export agreement after negotiations inWashington this week, a spokesman for the Taiwan TextileFederation said.    Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accordhas been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Hasagreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textileand apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989,he said. "The new accord is more fair and gives breathing spaceto our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports toother nations," he added.    Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similartextile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. Butdespite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivalsin Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwandollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct againstthe U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won roseby some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable.    Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the samethis year, Chen said.
