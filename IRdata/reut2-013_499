The dollar opened lower following thetrend set earlier in the Far East and Europe, dealers said.    Still, the U.S. currency remained well within recenttrading ranges because few operators are prepared to go out ona limb ahead of today's meeting of Group of Five financeministers and central bankers in Washington.    The overnight sell-off was partly due to skepticism thatthis week's monetary talks will yield new or lasting measuresto stabilise currencies. But whatever their opinions, U.S.dealers remained cautious of selling the dollar aggressively.    The dollar opened at 145.10/20 yen, down from 145.85/90.    The dollar's decline occurred despite renewed Bank of Japanintervention on its behalf in Tokyo, dealers noted. Dealers inJapan said the central bank bought dollars steadily for yenduring Tokyo hours.    "There were some large sell-orders in Tokyo, but apparentlyit wasn't too hectic," said a dealer at one major U.S. bank."The tone still is very cautious ahead of the Washingtonmeetings."    The dollar also opened at 1.8220/30 marks, down from1.8260/70 at last night's close, and at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs,down from 1.5180/90.    Meanwhile, sterling prolonged its advance with the aid ofmore public opinion polls indicating the ruling Conservativeparty would retain power with a large majority in any generalelection. Sterling rose to 1.6186/91 dlrs, from 1.6175/85 onMonday, but eased slightly to about 2.953 marks from 2.955.    Dealers did not detect any U.K. intervention to subdue thepound today. Some said the U.K. central bank may have boughtdollars for yen in Europe, but this could not be confirmed.    The dollar eased to 1.3071/76 Canadian dollars from1.3080/85 yesterday, showing limited response to presidentReagan's endorsement of efforts for U.S./Canada free trade. Reuter&#3;
