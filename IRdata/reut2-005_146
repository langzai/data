President Reagan for the first timeadmitted he was wrong to sell arms to Iran in an initiativewhich four months ago plunged him into the worst crisis of hissix-year-old presidency.    He made the admission in a weekly radio address whiledefending the role played by Secretary of State George Shultzand Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the affair.    He said: "In the case of the Iranian arms sale matter, bothSecretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger advised me stronglynot to pursue the initiative. I weighed their advice butdecided in the end the initiative was worth the risk and wentforward."    "As we now know, it turned out they were right and I waswrong. But they discharged their responsibilities as myadvisers and as my subordinates," he said.    Since the scandal broke last November, Shultz andWeinberger have said they told Reagan of their opposition tothe deal and were not fully informed of the effort, carried outby National Security Council members.    They also said they were unaware of the diversion ofmillions of dollars in profits from the arms sales to theNicaraguan contra rebels, who have been fighting the leftistManagua government for six years.
