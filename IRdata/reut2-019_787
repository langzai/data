A specially convened Franco-Germanmeeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed tomake any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that hasdeeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said    The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreignministers from both countries and by French President FrancoisMitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by ChancellorHelmut Kohl of West Germany.    The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key toproviding a solution to a long-term settlement of theCommunity's worst-ever budget crisis.    "The Germans clearly do not want to budge," an aide to Chiractold reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visiblyangered as he the hour-long meeting.    Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal forthe Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically theEC's complex "green" currrency system, designed to translatecommon EC farm prices into national currencies.    Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax whichWest Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and theNetherlands.    EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on thepackage, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadlinetomorrow.    Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could haveinjected fresh impetus into those talks.    The Commission proposed its package to save one billiondollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget.    The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves toalter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, andplugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987. Reuter&#3;
