Traders here and in Paris said theresults of today's EC white sugar tender are hard to forecastbecause of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch andBelgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar intointervention.    London traders said bids for licences have been reportedbetween 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licencesare granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of thatrange, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.    Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates ofbetween 43 and 43.50 Ecus.    Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export,the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the Londontraders said, while the French sources declined to estimatevolume in view of the psychological impact of the planned salesinto intervention in protest against EC export policies.    Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at amaximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus. REUTER&#3;
