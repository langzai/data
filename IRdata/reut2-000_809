The yen should stabilize at around152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar for about a year, the Bank ofTokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said.    "Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stabilityof the currencies. The major target of the Japanese governmentis to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest ofthe year," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.    Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen upfurther because this might spark off inflation and depress theU.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election.    The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar. REUTER&#3;
