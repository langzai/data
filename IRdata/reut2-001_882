Sri Lanka's largest bank, thegovernment-owned Bank of Ceylon, plans to adopt a moreaggressive and selective interest rate policy to reduce excessliquidity, estimated at some 500 mln rupees, and enlarge thecountry's export manufacturing base, the bank's new chairmanNimal Sandaratne told Reuters in an interview.    The bank aims to reduce terms for prime customers and isholding talks with the Export Development Board on details tobe announced later, he said.    Sandaratne was head of research at the Central Bank ofCeylon, the nation's central bank, until January.    A Swiss-based non-governmental group, which Sandaratnedeclined to identify, has agreed in principal to guaranteeexport credits, he said, but refused to elaborate further.    The bank may also consider more actively participating inthe foreign exchange markets in light of its substantialnon-resident foreign currency holdings of about 473 mln rupees,or about 70 pct of the total market, he said.    Sandaratne said the bank may sell 60 pct of its shares inits wholly-owned subsidiary, Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd.    The Asian Development Bank and a foreign bank operatinghere have already expressed interests in acquiring a stake inMBSL, Sandaratne said.    He tentatively estimated the Bank of Ceylon's net profitsfor calendar 1986 at 163 mln rupees up from 133 mln theprevious year. The increase was eroded by increased provisionsfor bad debts, he said. About 50 mln was written off and 17 mlnallotted for general provisions, he added. REUTER&#3;
