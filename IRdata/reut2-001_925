USAir Group Inc said its board hasrejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in thebest interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.    The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."    USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc&lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer toacquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share andremaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued atabout 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price ofUSAir common during a period just before the merger.    The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont onarriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companieshope to reach one very shortly.    USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature andother terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and thecircumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believesthat the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAirGroup's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.    "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by CarlIcahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisitionof Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views asmost beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees andpassengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary tohis own personal interests."    USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore allappropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA'slast-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisitionof Piedmont.    The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWAobtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rightsissued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fairprice" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable tothe TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.
