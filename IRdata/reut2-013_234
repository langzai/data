A consortium headed by the constructiongroup Bouygues SA has been awarded a 50-pct controlling stakein French state television network TF1, which stock marketanalysts said represented a major boost for Bouygues.    The Bouygues-led consortium was widely regarded as the lesslikely of the two candidates in contention to be awarded thethree billion franc stake by the National Commission forCommunications and Liberties (NCCL), the French televisionwatchdog authority.    The losing candidate was a consortium headed by publishinggroup Hachette SA &lt;HACP.PA>.    The NCCL decision awarded the Bouygues consortium a 50-pctcontrolling stake in a company which will have a 10-yearoperating concession for TF1, France's oldest and most widelywatched television network.    Independent market analysis group C.O.P.S. In a note onBouygues said the award would represent a major diversificationfor the group out of the highly cyclical construction industryinto the rapidly expanding media business.    Bouygues in February said it estimated 1986 group netattributable profit at 480 mln francs, up from 443 mln for1985, on consolidated turnover of 45.8 billion francs, up from26.3 billion.    The sharp rise in turnover reflected the groups acquisitionof the loss-making SCREG construction group last year.    Bouygues closed on the Paris stock market at 1,451 francson Friday, up from 1,405 the previous day, but well below itsyear's high of 1,475.    Hachette closed at 3,280, up from a previous 3,250.    Bouygues holds a 50-pct stake in the winning consortium,giving it a 25-pct stake in TF1.    The U.K.-based &lt;Pergamon Media Trust> of Robert Maxwell hasa 20-pct stake in the consortium, representing a 10 pct stakein TF1, while &lt;Maxwell Media France> has a six pct stake, orthree pct of the television network.    Minority shareholders in the consortium include the&lt;GMF/FNAC> group, Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, &lt;EditionsMondiale>, the &lt;Groupe Bernard Tapie>, &lt;Financiere Faltas>,&lt;Banque Indosuez> and Credit Lyonnais &lt;CRLP.PA>.    The remaining 50 pct of TF1 is to be split between a 40-pctstake to be offered to the general public and a 10-pct stake tobe offered to employees. REUTER&#3;
