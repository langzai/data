CBT soybean futures held gains of threeto 6-1/2 cents per bushel in moderately light midsession trade,with new crop supported by local house buying.    Slow country movement, steady to firmer cash soybean basisvalues and a delayed Brazilian harvest combined to supportfutures from the opening, despite a disappointing drop in theweekly soybean export figure yesterday, traders said.    The advance above the psychologically important 5.00 dlrmark in both old and new crop kept the chart picture bullish,which could limit declines when South American sales begin topick-up later this month, they added.    However, some traders said new crop prices above 5.00 dlrsa bushel could encourage some farmers to plant more soybeanacres than they originally planned. Reuter&#3;
