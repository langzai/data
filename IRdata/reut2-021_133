Federal Reserve Board Vice-ChairmanManuel Johnson cautioned against seeking "quick-fix solutions" topersistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.    In particular, he told an American Stock Exchangeconference, a decline in the dollar below current levels wouldexacerbate financial market conditions.    "Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely belowcurrent levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditionsand lead to further potential for financial problems."    Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.    He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persistingdespite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in thepast two years.    But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soonbegin showing improvement.    "The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructiveexpansion without inflationary instability," he said. Reuter&#3;
