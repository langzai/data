U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright said hewas concerned that the appointment of Alan Greenspan to succeedPaul Volcker at the Federal Reserve Board would mean interestrates would rise.    Speaking to reporters, the Texas Democrat said that basedof Greenspan's tenure as chairman of President Nixon's Councilof Economic Advisers his policies would mean higher rates.    "His previous service indicates the kind of economicpolicies based on the trickle down theory rather than thepercolate up theory. This theory tends to higher interestrates," Wright said.    Wright told reporters he would not have chosen Greenspan tohead the Fed, but he declined to name his preference. "It wouldbe someone whose primary interest is in keeping interest rateslow. That is the national interest," he said.    His main concern was that high interest rates have slowedeconomic growth and held down the number of new jobs. TheUnited States needs "to reduce the level of interest rates sothis economy can get oxygen and breathe," Wright said.    Wright said he had not talked with Greenspan about theappointment.    Asked to rate Volcker's tenure, he replied, "Long." Reuter&#3;
