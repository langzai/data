Standard and Poor's Corp said it maydowngrade the 100 mln dlrs of B-plus 13-5/8 pct seniorsubordinated debentures due 1997 of Bally Health and TennisCorp, a unit of Bally Manufacturing Corp.    S and P cited the parent's proposals to sell Bally Healthfor more than 500 mln dlrs to an investor group. It noted thetransaction includes the assumption of Bally Health's debt.    Although the investor group's plans are not known, theacquisition will probably be debt financed and markedlyincrease Bally Health's financial risk. S and P said the saleof the unit would increase the parent's financial position.    In a related action, Standard and Poor's affirmed the debtratings of Bally Manufacturing and related entities. Affirmedwere BB first mortgage bonds, BB-minus second mortgage bondsand B-plus subordinated debt.    S and P said pro-form debt leverage for BallyManufacturing, adjusted to capitalize operating leases, dropsto a still high 68 pct from an aggressive 75.5 pct at June 30.Adjusted for asset sales, the parent company's return oncapital, 11.6 pct in 1986, should remain subpar, S and P said.
