ImmunoGenetics Inc said it hasentered the liposome technology field through its majorityowned subsidiary, Molecular Packaging Systems Inc.    Liposomes are small sacks of lipid, or fat, membranesarranged in layers like an onion. These sacks can carry avariety of agents that are released over a period of time intothe body as the onion-like layers break down.    It said Molecular has developed a versatile low-cost methodfor encapsulating a broad range of health care and industrialproducts, including human hemoglobin which transports oxygen inthe blood.    Immunogenetics also said Molecular's liposomes, calledMicropak, can carry more than five times the amount ofparticles than conventional liposomes.    The company also said its technology for encapsulatinghemoglobin may prove helpful in preventing the spread ofhepatitis and the AIDS virus in blood transfusions as allviruses and foreign agents are moved during preparation of thehemogloblin.
