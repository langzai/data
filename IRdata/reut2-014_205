Daltex Medical Sciences Inc said anon-toxic, oral drug to treat skin disorders, such as redness,scattered pimples, yellow and wrinkling associated with aging,has been filed by the inventors and assigned to the company.    The inventors are Dr. Albert M. Kligman and Dr. GerdPlewig. Kligman, a University of Pennsylvania dermatologist,discovered the use of retinoic acid for treating acne.    Daltex said initial tests of the drug, a retinoid compound,have proved effective in treating "problem" skin most oftenfound in those over 50 and in those whose skin problems havebeen aggravated by excessive sun exposure.    In a Daltex statement, Dr Kligman said that daily doses ofthe drug can "moderate or reverse" a number of skin problemswithout the side effects typically associated with retinoidcompounds.    He said more than 100 men and women in the U.S. and Germanyhave been treated for six months to two years with the drug,and said studies indicate that its therapeutic effect can bemaintained if patients take maintenance doses two or threetimes a week.
