Moody's Investors Service Inc said itdowngraded Niagara Mohawk Power Corp's 2.2 billion dlrs of debtsecurities and preferred stock.    Moody's cited cost increases at the utility's Nine MileNuclear Unit 2 and an unfavorable rate decision by the New YorkPublic Service Commission.    Cut were the company's first mortgage bonds and securedpollution control issues to Baa-2 from Baa-1, and Eurobonds,unsecured pollution control debt, unsecured medium-term notesand preferred stock to Baa-3 from Baa-2. Niagara Mohawk'sPrime-2 commercial paper was left unchanged.    Moody's said the rate decision last month by the PublicService Commission would significantly pressure NiagaraMohawk's coverage of fixed charges.    Moreover, cost increases associated with the in-servicedelay of the 41 pct owned Nine Mile Unit 2 from September 1987to early 1988, along with prospective delays, are unlikely tobe recovered under the cost-settlement agreement for thenuclear unit, Moody's noted.    The potential write-off would sharply reduce NiagaraMohawk's common equity and may impair financial flexibility,the agency said. Reuter&#3;
