Spanish exporters are asking thegovernment to clear 33,200 tonnes of sunflower seed authorisedfor export by the European Community (EC), a spokesman for oneof Spain's major sunflower oil producers said.    He told Reuters in a telephone interview the government washolding back on authorisation to hold prices low.    "They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet thisyear's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on whatlooks like a bigger harvest than we expected," he said.    He said the policy of allowing stocks to accumulate hadcaused a price drop, with raw oil prices falling to 147 pesetasa kilo from 160 at the start of the 1986/87 marketing yearending July 31.    Sunflower oil output was expected to rise to 370,000 tonnesthis year from 340,000 last year, with seed output up at905,000 tonnes from 860,000 last year.    He said domestic consumption was falling due to imports ofother edible oils. "We estimate demand at 296,000 tonnes thisyear, leaving a 124,000 tonne surplus with the 50,000 tonnesnow stockpiled," he said. "If we discount 24,000 tonnes held forstrategic purposes, this still leaves us with 100,000 tonnes." Reuter&#3;
