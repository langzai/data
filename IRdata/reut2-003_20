The 20.3 billion dlr debt reschedulingaccord Venezuela signed a week ago will reduce its paymentsover the next three years by 64 pct, according to FinanceMinistry figures released this weekend.    A ministry statistical analysis said while the originalaccord called for payments of 3.82 billion dlrs between 1987and 1989, the new agreement requires debt servicing of 1.35billion over the same period. In 1987, Venezuela will berequired to pay 250 mln dlrs instead of the 1.55 billionoriginally agreed. Payments in 1988 were cut to 400 mln from1.20 billion, and in 1989 to 700 mln from 1.11 billion.    The ministry's analysis said the reduction in debtservicing during 1987-1989 amounts to an effective graceperiod, something the Venezuelan negotiators sought fromcreditor banks but were not granted.    Most of the rescheduling falls during 1994-1998, when 53.3pct, or some 11.25 billion dlrs, must be paid. Under theFebruary 27 accord, Venezuela will repay 20.3 billion dlrs ofpublic sector debt over 14 years at 7/8 of a percentage pointover London interbank offered rates (Libor).    This compares with the February 1986 accord which calledfor a 12-year term and interest of 1-1/8 point over Libor. REUTER&#3;
