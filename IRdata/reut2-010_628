BASF AG saidthe volatile currency situation last year, particularly thefall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominatedin marks and to price reductions for exports from domesticproduction.    But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the groupsaid it expected satisfactory business development over thenext months. "At the moment we do not expect any extraordinaryinfluences such as there were last year," it said. Orders inhand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.    BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-taxprofit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.    The unusual situation on the crude oil market last yearalso produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector andforced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.    The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses onstocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. Inthe parent company, the positive earnings developmentcontinued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover wasbalanced out by increased capacity use and price declines inraw materials.     In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.    Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors finechemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved inthose areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.    Results from these had been taken only partly into thefourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.    So far in the current year, the investment volume of theparent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986,BASF said, without giving concrete figures. REUTER&#3;
