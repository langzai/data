A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    "I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need," he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal"blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.    The committee voted largely along party lines, with threeDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure. Reuter&#3;
