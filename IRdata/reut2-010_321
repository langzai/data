The finance ministry appears ready toallow Japanese financial institutions to use overseas financialfutures markets, a ministry official said.    He declined to say when, but banking sources expectapproval as early as April. Banks, securities houses andinsurance companies are expected to become eligible to deal indeposit, interest rate, bond and stock index futures.    Ministry officials said they are wary of giving permissionto individuals or corporations because of their relativeinexperience.    Broking for Japanese residents by financial institutionswould be prohibited as securities exchange laws bar banks fromdoing this, the banking sources said.    Overseas subsidiaries and branches of Japanese banks andsecurities houses have already been allowed to use the overseasfutures markets on their own accounts.    The Finance Ministry Ordinance based on Foreign ExchangeAdministration Law will have to be revised to allow localinstitutions to join the overseas markets, a ministry officialsaid. REUTER&#3;
