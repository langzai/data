Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Partystarted moves to push through the delayed draft budget for1987/88 through Parliament, deepening a clash with theopposition which called the move rash and unforgivable.    In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliamentdecided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee tohold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14,parliamentary officials said.    The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations lastTuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over acontroversial government-proposed sales tax plan.    Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have beendelaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales taxon which the budget plan is based.    A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would againboycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind.    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has vowed to pushthrough the tax reforms, told reporters: "Watching closelynegotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, I wouldlike to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly."    The five pct tax, part of Nakasone's tax reform plan, isplanned to start next January to help offset cuts in individualincome and corporate tax.    The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearingbecause the LDP could technically stop deliberations on thebudget and ram it through the budget committee and then a LowerHouse plenary session, political analysts said.    The four opposition parties called the LDP move "anunforgivable, rash act" and said they would fight to scrap thesales tax. REUTER&#3;
