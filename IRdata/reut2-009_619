The Glass-Steagall Act separatingbanking and securities activities in the U.S. is all but deadfollowing decisions by federal and state authorities, thechairman of Bankers Trust Co asserted.    "There are plainly nails in the coffin of Glass-Steagall,"Alfred Brittain said in remarks prepared for delivery to ameeting of bank and financial analysts.    He noted the Federal Reserve Board is due to decide BankersTrust's application for a subsidiary that can underwritecertain securities.    Brittain said New York State bank regulators have welcomedapplications for affiliates of New York-chartered banks whichcould underwrite corporate securities. And he said a U.S. Courtof Appeals upheld Bankers Trust's commercial paper business.    He said eventually the financial services industry will seefewer but bigger companies drawn from the ranks of the presentcommercial banks, investment banks and conglomerates.    On another topic, Britain called for a redefinition of therole of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.    "I think we should return to the original purpose of FDICinsurance -- to protect small despositors and not depositoryinstitutions themselves," Brittain said.    He suggested banks be permitted to offer both insureddeposits and uninsured deposits. High quality assets would besegregated to back up insured deposits.    He said big banks could then fail without draining theinsurance funds. "Stockholders could be wiped out, managementrmemoved and uninsured creditors could take their fair share ofany losses," he said. But insured deposits under 100,000 dlrswould be protected. Reuter&#3;
