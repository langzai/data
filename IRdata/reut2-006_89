The American Stock Exchange said it isprepared to move settlement prices for its broad-based stockindex contracts to the stock market opening on expirationFridays providing the change is part of an industry-wide moveto a uniform system.    "We believe it is in the best interests of the industry forall markets to participate  in a coordinated move to baseexpiration Friday settlement prices on the stock marketopening," Amex president Kenneth Leibler said in a statmenet.    He said non-uniform procedures will lead to "market andinvestor confusion."    Leibler said expirations based on openings "appears tooffer greater opportunities than the close to most efficientlyhandle any order imbalances which may occur on expirationFridays."    He said the markets would have the remainder of the tradingday to correct any "price dislocations" that occur. Marketanalysts have attributed some wide swings in the stock marketin part to arbitrage activity involving index options andfutures and individual stocks.    Options on the Major Market Index and the InstitutionalIndex, which now expire at the close, are traded on the Amex. Reuter&#3;
