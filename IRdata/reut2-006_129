Finance and economy ministers of theGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting todiscuss further economic integration, officials said.    They said issues to be discussed by the ministers fromBahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United ArabEmirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bankgovernors on a common currency exchange rate.    The governors agreed in January on a denominator on whichto base currencies of the six states. Any decision will beforwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due inSaudi Arabia late this year.    The six states have different currency systems. SaudiArabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to theInternational Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- thespecial drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.    Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, whileKuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised byitself.    The denominator chosen by central bank governors has notbeen disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to belinked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.    Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister ofState for Finance and Industry, said implementation of jointeconomic agreements "is increasingly linking the interests ofGCC citizens together."
