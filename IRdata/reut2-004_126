Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> hopes foranother excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading inthe right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.    The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swissfrancs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividendper bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.    Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded thecompany's target of five pct real annual growth, had been madepossible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.    Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economicaffairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24billion francs was due to currency factors.    A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offsetby growth in operations and by structural changes within thegroup.    Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francsfrom 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolatesector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. Thetonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices andlower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.    Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germanyto 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result ofacquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25pct against 25.3 pct.    Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pctfrom 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despitewrite-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A furtherincrease in tax levels was expected in future.    Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mlnthe previous year. REUTER&#3;
