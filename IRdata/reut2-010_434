The Agriculture Department'swidening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect countyposted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDAofficial said.    All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will countieswhich use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabamaand Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of CommodityOperations Division for the USDA.    USDA last night notified the grain industry that effectiveimmediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior cornwould be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,depending on what the differential is.    USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high postedcounty prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.    "We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for amonth, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in anynearby time," Burgess said.    Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulfdifferentials when and if Gulf prices recede. "If we're off themark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off themark if we're too low?" he said.    While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are beingplanned right now.    "We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and wedon't make changes often," he said. Reuter&#3;
