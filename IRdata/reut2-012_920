Rohm and Haas Co said healthstudies on workers at its Philadelphia plant showed higherdeath rates from four kinds of cancer compared with mortalityrates among the general public.    The studies covered a total of about 6,000 workers employedat the plant from 1948 through 1981.    Mortality rates from two other types of cancer, respiratorycancer and leukemia, had declined compared to earlier studies,the plastics and chemicals company said.    Potential causes and incidence of pancreatic, colon/rectal,prostate and bladder cancer will be studied further, a companyspokesman said.    The studies found elevated mortality rates from the fourcancer types. But the finding does not appear to be linked withproducts or processes at the plant, Rohm and Haas said.    The reports revealed no new evidence of health risk fromoperations at the plant, it added.    Respiratory cancer deaths among workers exposed to certainchemical operations before 1971 remain elevated but havedeclined from levels reported in 1974. And deaths from leukemiahave fallen to near normal levels from those reported in 1975.    A study completed in 1974 after an outbreak of respiratorycancer among employees linked the disease to exposure to acarcinogen, bischloromethyl ether, which is made at the plant.    The production of the chemical, an intermediary used inmaking industrial fluid cleaners, was isolated in 1971 soworkers were no longer exposed to it, the spokesman said.    Last summer, Rohm and Haas settled 22 individual lawsuitsand one class action suit related to deaths from exposure tothe chemical. Reuter&#3;
