Plans to provide direct incomeaids for European Community (EC) small farmers to help themface deep cuts in guaranteed crop prices received a mixedreception from EC agriculture ministers, EC officials said.    The plans were discussed at an informal meeting of theministers hosted in the village of Genval by the Council ofMinisters' current chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker.    The EC Executive Commission has proposed that the richermember states be allowed to make direct payments to theirfarmers in special difficulties, while the EC itself wouldfinance a similar scheme in the poorer EC countries.    However, EC officials said only the Netherlands andLuxembourg supported this idea at today's meeting, and France,Denmark and Belgium showed marked hostility to it.    French minister Francois Guillaume told reporters, "Farmersshould not become recipients of public assistance -- theirsurvival should be assured by price mechanisms and the market."    The officials said the ministers had not sought to resolvetheir more urgent differences over guaranteed farm prices for1987/88 at this meeting.    The ministers will resume talks on the price fixing issuein Luxembourg on June 15. Reuter&#3;
