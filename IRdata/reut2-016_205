U.S. Secretary of State George Shultzand Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met today an inelegant Moscow mansion in pursuit of the first superpower armscontrol agreement in nearly a decade.    Shultz, accompanied by senior advisers and technicalexperts, arrived from Helsinki aboard a U.S. Air Force planeand went straight into a closed-door meeting with Shevardnadzeand Soviet negotiators.    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reportersthat U.S. Arms control advisers had been told not to discussthe U.S. Proposals with the press.    U.S. Officials have been optimistic about the possibilityof progress at the talks, scheduled to end on Wednesday.    Shultz has been more guarded, saying that if the Sovietofficials approached the talks in the same constructive spiritas the Americans "we should be able to move the ball along in avery positive way."    Shultz is expected to protest about a spying network thathas come to light at the U.S. Embassy and which has cast ashadow over his talks. For its part the Soviet Union has saidits diplomatic missions in the United States are subjected tosurveillance and has accused Washington of "spy-mania."    Shevardnadze met Shultz with a handshake at the door of theornate guest house built by a Russian merchant, now belongingto the Foreign Ministry. Later, in the white marble room wherethe discussions were being held, they had to be prompted byphotographers to shake hands again.    "There was no instinctive warmth," an observer said. Reuter&#3;
