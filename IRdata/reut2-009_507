International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,Council chairman, Denis Bra Kanon, said he will attempt toreach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the InternationalCocoa Agreement.    Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations amongproducers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstandingdifferences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock canpurchase and differentials to be fixed for different origincocoa, consumer delegates told reporters.    Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegationsindividually in attempt to iron out remaining problems.    Producers and consumers indicated support "in principle" forthe draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the pastweek by a small working group, consumer delegates said.    Despite remaining differences delegates remained confidenta buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when thecouncil session ends, but certain technical points need furtherclarification, the delegates said.    Certain consumers are concerned that differentials includedin the draft buffer stock package are out of line with marketrealities, consumer delegates said.    Unless these are modified there are fears it would promotepurchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which arenormally required by manufacturers, they said.    Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoamight lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which woulddepress prices, they added. Reuter&#3;
