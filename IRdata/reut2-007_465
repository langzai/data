Whether the European Community'sCouncil of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetableoils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain,an EC official said.    "It is very far from certain that it will go through," SirRoy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, toldreporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association.    Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and WestGermany has opposed it in the past.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatenedretaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon.    Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate aboutagriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling tosingle out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or putagricultural policy on a special fast track.    "The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in theframing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers onboth sides of the Atlantic," he said.
