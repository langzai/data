A counter-proposal from creditorbanks to Argentina's request for rescheduling its 50 billiondlr foreign debt was full of holes, an Argentine observer atnegotiations said.    "The negotiations are not going to prosper if (the creditorbanks) do not change the counter-proposal put to Argentina, asit is a Swiss cheese full of holes," ruling Radical Party DeputyRaul Baglini said.    Baglini, who was recently observing negotiations with thesteering committee for Argentina's creditor banks in New York,spoke to reporters in Mendoza, 600 miles west of Buenos Aires.    Baglini said the counter-proposal did not take into accountArgentina's request for a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet fourpct growth targets in 1987. Reuter&#3;
