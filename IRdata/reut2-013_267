Indonesia has imported 12,000 tonnes ofrefined sugar from Cuba to meet consumer demand in the provinceof South Sulawesi, the head of the provincial food agency said.    The imported sugar was needed because two of three sugarrefineries in the province have been temporarily shut down. Itarrived in the provincial capital of Ujungpandang today andwill be distributed to markets in the province, the food agencyofficial said.    Indonesia used to be a sugar exporter but last year itimported 162,500 tonnes of sugar from Thailand, Angola andBrazil to bolster its depleted stocks.    Indonesia's sugar cane production last year was expected torise significantly but domestic sugar consumption has soaredbecause of rising demand by the food processing industry, thehead of the food logistics agency, Bustanil Arifin, has said.    The government has forecast that sugar production incalendar 1987 would increase 30.2 pct to 2.59 mln tonnes from1.99 mln in 1986 but industry sources doubt whether the targetcould be met due to persistent post-harvest handling andtransport problems.
