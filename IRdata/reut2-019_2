The House today supported a call forJapan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden ofprotecting Western interests in sensitive areas around theworld, including in the Gulf.    House member approved a measure that would requireSecretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japanon increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct ofits gross national product.    The measure, passed during consideration of the 1988-89State Department funding bill would not require an increase,but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense. TheSenate must approve the measure before it becomes law.    "We don't have to bash the Japanese. We have to show themhow to share the burden of the defense of the free world," saidRep. Robert Dornan, a California Republican.    The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks withJapan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of twoalternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP ondefense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to theUnited States as a kind of security fee.
