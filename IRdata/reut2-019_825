Middle South Utilities Inc said theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission has requested a 30-daystay of a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling ordering the commissionto reconsider its allocation of costs from the Grand Gulf Onenuclear power plant.    More than two years ago, FERC set the allocation af GrandGulf capacity and costs among the four Middle South operatingcompanies. These allocations, in turn, have become the basisfor contested rate filings the four operating utilities made toregulators in their service areas.    In a ruling dated June 24 and distributed June 26, the U.S.Court of Appeals in Washington reversed its January 1987decision and ordered FERC to explain its criteria fordetermining undue discrimination and why the FERC's allocationcurrently in effect is not unduly discriminatory under thatdefinition, Middle South said.    The company said the ruling by the three-judge appealscourt panel "was totally unexpected, especially in light of thetimetable the full 11-member court set in April of this yearwhen it announced that all judges would rehear the panel'sJanuary decision in which the panel had upheld FERC.    In essence, Middle South said, "the three-member panel hasadopted the dissenting opinion as the new majority opinion, andthe full court has accepted the new decision."    The company said it supports FERC's motion for a stay. Thecommission said it needed the time to determine the appropriatecourse it should take in light of the new court decision.    "Given its complexity and the need for clarification by theFERC, the significance of this latest order will take time todetermine," Middle South said in a statement. Reuter&#3;
