&lt;BillitonInternational Metals B.V.>, the Dutch mining company, has urgedSurinam to change policies it says are causing heavy losses onbauxite mining operations there, a company spokesman said.    He told Reuters that Billiton, a fully-owned RoyalDutch/Shell &lt;RD.AS> subsidiary, presented the demands to HenkHeidweiler, a top aide to Surinam military leader DesiBouterse, who visited the Netherlands last week for officialtalks.    Billiton and &lt;Suralco>, owned by U.S. Conglomerate Alcoa&lt;AA.S>, both want devaluation, and lower wages, welfarecontributions, taxes on bauxite and energy prices.    The two firms are the biggest private sector employers inSurinam. Billiton also urged Heidweiler to improve the safetyof its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerillagroup, the spokesman said, adding rebel fighting since July1986 had depressed production at Billiton and Suralco plants.    High voltage cables from the power plant of Afobakka havebeen cut, and a bauxite mine at Moengo has been shut, he added.    "We are already making vast losses in Surinam and you can'texpect any company to remain operating with losses," thespokesman said. REUTER&#3;
