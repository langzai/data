Cyclops Corp said the threemembers of its board appointed last week by &lt;Dixons Group PLC>had resigned and that it named three Cyclops executives toreplace them.    Cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earliertoday by Dixons that it received only 20 pct of Cyclopsoutstanding common stock under an extended tender offer thatexpired yesterday.    Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offeron March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares.    However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Fridaypressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K.-basedcompany had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclopsstock be tendered by the close of the offer.    Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earliertoday indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclopsshares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares,or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops sharesoutstanding.    Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares,which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives ita 21.7 pct stake in Cyclops.    Cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the threenewly named directors and five outside directors, all of whomwere on the board prior to Dixons tender offer.    The three Cyclops directors were replaced by Dixonsappointees on March 17 under an agreement reached between thetwo companies. Reuter&#3;
