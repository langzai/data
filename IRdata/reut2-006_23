Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambalaconfirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through SouthAfrica and announced that its state-run mining company hadclosed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.    He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in aninterview the government was diverting all mineral exportsalong rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira inMozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copperand other minerals were being shipped through these two ports,but he said there had not been any problem with the newarrangements.    "So far our copper has been reaching its destinationswithout hindrance," he told the Times.    The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambiaexported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomaticsources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia'sability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaamwithout causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.    Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia ConsolidatedCopper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office inJohannesburg, since it was now redundant. Reuter&#3;
