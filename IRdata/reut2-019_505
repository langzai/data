France's state-run television channelTF-1, which is in the process of being privatised, shouldachieve a profit of around 25 francs per share next year afterseveral years of losses, but will not make a profit this year,the new TF-1 president Francis Bouygues said.    Interviewed on TF-1 on the eve of the public flotation of40 pct of the channel's equity, Bouygues said "in 1988 we haveto make a profit, and we will make a profit."    "I envisage per share profits of 25 francs," he said. "I amvery optimistic."    Bouygues said exceptional costs associated with therestructuring of the station would prevent a profit this year.    The state sold a 50 pct stake in TF-1 in April to aconsortium led by Bouygues, a construction magnate, andincluding British press baron Robert Maxwell.    Tomorrow 40 pct of the shares go on sale to the public at165 francs each, while 10 pct will be offered at a specialprice of 132 francs a share to the station's staff.    Bouygues said a dividend would be paid to shareholders nextyear if the station did return to profit.    Asked if he thought the flotation price was right, Bouyguessaid, "I paid virtually double...I consider that it is a goodbuy."    The Bouygues consortium paid three billion francs for its50 pct controlling stake in April.    After the two-week public flotation, TF-1 shares will starttrading on the second market here in late July. REUTER&#3;
