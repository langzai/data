Congress should give the U.S.Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybeanloan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushelin order to help resolve the problem of soybean exportcompetitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.    Speaking to reporters following a Senate AgricultureAppropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out ofthe current soybean program "dilemma" would be for Congress toallow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if theloan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to makeU.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates tofurther buydown the loan rate.    Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot beless than 4.77 dlrs per bu.    Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change thefarm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.    The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.    Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision onsoybean program changes will be the budget costs.    He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is thatthe U.S. loan rate provides an "umbrella" to foreign productionand causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.    Asked about the American Soybean Association's request forsome form of income support, Amstutz said "the competitiveproblem is the most severe." He said USDA is still studying thesituation and "no resolution" has yet been found. Reuter&#3;
