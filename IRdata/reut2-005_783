Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe'sstate-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agriculturalindustry sources said.    They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline toaround 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercialfarmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.    Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveriessince 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a foodshortage in Zimbabwe.    While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes,which means that even with the sharply reduced production thisyear Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.    The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybeandeliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.
