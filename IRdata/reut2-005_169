Peru will put into effect Monday a foreignexchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slidein the country's international reserves, a government decree inthe Official Gazette said.    Under the system, importers will be required to present abill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a licensefor foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days todecide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.    Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrscompared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.    The system will be effective until the end of 1988.    A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set bya council with members from the central bank, the economyministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. Thecentral bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange inaccordance with guidelines set by the council.    Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the tradesurplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.   Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against2.97 billion in 1985.   Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic productgrew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth levelregistered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminaryestimates.    The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-linedebt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3billion dlr foreign debt. REUTER&#3;
