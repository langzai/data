Mobil Corp Chairman Allen E. Murray saidthe company's exploration and production budget would not beincreased in the foreseeable future as it is "operating on theassumption that (oil) prices will remain on the lower end ofthe spectrum.     "Our budget is at about the same level as it was last yearand I think it is the right amount," said Murray who was intown for ceremonies celebrating the consolidation of Mobil'sdomestic exploration and production operations into a new,locally-based subsidiary.     Last year, Mobil spent a total of 2.13 billion dlrs onexploration and production, 341 mln dlrs in the United Statesand 1.79 billion overseas.     Murray said the new subsidiary, Mobil Exploration andProduction U.S. Inc., was not created as "part of any costsaving effort" but instead to "increase our efficiency andability to stay ahead of the pack."     The consolidation will, however, save Mobil about 15 mlndlrs annually once relocation and reorganization costs havebeen absorbed, according to A.F. Stancell, vice president ofU.S. producing operations for the company.     Mobil, the nation's second largest oil company, respondedto the collapse of oil prices last year -- from 30 dlrs abarrel at end-1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986 -- bylaying off 5,500 people and cutting its budget in midyear by 27percent, or 1.1 billion dlrs.     Of that amount, more than 900 mln dlrs was eliminated fromits exploration and spending spending plans.     But the company reported an increase in profits in 1986over 1985 and a jump in per share earnings to 3.45 dlrs a sharefrom 2.55 dlrs.            Reuter&#3;
