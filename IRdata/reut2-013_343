West German banking regulations must beexpanded to cover off-balance sheet risks arising from newfinancing forms, Federal Banking Supervisory Office PresidentWolfgang Kuntze said.    Kuntze told bankers at a reception that deals for hedgingprice risks are not covered by current supervisory rules.    Such deals could be used for speculation and do not have tobe disclosed.    Kuntze also said it must be considered whether banks cancontinue not to set shareholders' equity and reserves againsttheir own holdings of securities.    Since early 1984, banks have been limited to lending 18times shareholders' equity and reserves on a consolidated basisand Bundesbank officials have said that interest rate andcurrency swaps and currency options are under scrutiny.    Authorities favour reinterpreting the banking law to fitpresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentarypolitical process of changing it, banking sources said.    Kuntze said solutions to the problem of banking supervisioncan be found without having to change the law again.    The risk structure in banking is moving away from the modelon which banking supervisory rules are based, Kuntze said.    Banking supervisors are still firemen with a safety net butthe safety net has become a little too small, he said.    Kuntze declined to detail possible changes to bankingregulations, as these are still the subject of discussionsbetween the Supervisory Office and the Bundesbank.    He said he sees no chance in the foreseeable future for aninternational harmonisation of supervisory law and the Germansupervisory office would not wait for such harmonisation.    Nor would it get involved in international competition onminimal regulatory standards in order to shield banks fromcompetitive disadvantages, he said. REUTER&#3;
