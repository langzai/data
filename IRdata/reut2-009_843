The Senate voted to condemn theproposed European common market tax on vegetable and marinefats and oils and said it would result in retaliation.    The non-binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senatesentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.    "The administration should communicate to the EuropeanCommunity the message that the United States will view theestablishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the EuropeanCommunity's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade that will result in the adoption of strong andimmediate countermeasures," the resolution stated.    The resolution said the European Community Commission hasproposed establishing a consumption tax on vegetable and fishoils and fats in conjunction with the setting of farm pricesfor the 1987/1988 EC marketing year.    The Senate said the tax would amount to almost 90 pct ofthe current price of soyoil and "have a restrictive effect" onU.S. exports of soybeans and vegetable oils to the EC.    It would be "blatantly inconsistent" with obligations of theEC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, theresolution said, and "constitute another egregious attempt" toimpose EC agricultural costs on trading partners.
