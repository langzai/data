Japan's Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasonehas refused to drop a proposed sales tax as debate on a draftbudget for 1987 resumed after a nine-day opposition boycott.    "I have no plan to withdraw the sales tax as I think it isthe best policy (for Japan)," Nakasone told the budget committeeof the lower house of parliament.    Kyodo News Agency said a small group of members ofNakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party filed a complaintwith their local headquarters calling for his expulsion fromthe party on the grounds he broke a campaign pledge byintroducing the sales tax.    Nakasone admitted the tax was a major factor in an upperhouse by-election defeat for his party on Sunday.    The election was the first national-level poll sinceNakasone presented his plan for overhauling Japan's tax system,which has remained unaltered for the past 36 years.    The sales tax and the planned abolition of the tax-freesaving system are designed to offset proposed income andcorporate tax cuts. REUTER&#3;
