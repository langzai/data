American motorists bought 16,524,000 usedcars last year at an average cost of 5,833 dlrs each for atotal market of 96.4 billion dlrs, according to a yearly studyby the Hertz Corp.    The study also showed an increase in used car sales ofabout 600,000 units over 1985 volumes while the average pricerose about 400 dlrs.    But the survey said the typical used car that changed handsin 1986 was slightly newer at 4.5 years old and 41,140 milesthan in the prior year, when such a car had run 45,270 milesand was 4.6 years old.    "The sample shows that retail sales volume for used carsturned up after two years of decline," said Leigh Smith, aHertz Corp. spokesman.    "And while costs of ownership went up to 25.5 cents a milefor used cars from 25.05 cents in 1985, they remain 47 pctunder the estimated 48.5 cents a mile cost to own and operate anew car."    The increase in activity appeared to be linked to therecord market for new cars, which passed 11.4 mln domestic andimported models last year because of the unprecedented cut-rateloan incentive packages offered by the Detroit-based automakersand changes in U.S. tax laws.    The incentive campaigns were largely sparked by GeneralMotors Corp &lt;GM> in an attempt to reverse its slipping share ofthe American car market. Reuter&#3;
