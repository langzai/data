Following Sunday's battle, French officers said the fall ofOuadi Doum deprived Libya of its only hard runway air base inChad. Its main strongpoint, Faya Largeau some 230 km (150miles) north of the so-called "red line" along the 16th parallel,was left increasingly exposed.    The 16th parallel divides the central African country intogovernment-held zones in the south and mainly Libyan-controlledareas in the north. Reuter&#3;
