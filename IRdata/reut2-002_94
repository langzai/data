French official reserves fell 45.06billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministrysaid in a statement.    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreigncurrency that preceded the January 11 realignment of theEuropean Monetary System (EMS).    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francsduring the month, the ministry said.    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs throughoperations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting fromthe quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits heldwith the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion francdeficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as aresult of using very short-term financing instruments.    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank andother central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchangemarkets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, inan attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flightof funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up thefranc.    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct againstthe French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reservesto 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74billion at end December.    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billionfrancs from 75.27 billion at end December.    Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mlnfrancs to 19.31 billion francs. REUTER&#3;
