The U.S. House of Representatives,in a key procedural vote, today opposed a grant of 40 mln dlrsto the Nicaraguan rebels until President Reagan accounts forprevious aid, including proceeds from U.S. Arms sales to Iran.    The major test of House sentiment came several hours beforethe chamber was to take a final vote on the assistance.    However, the 227 to 198 vote on a procedural matter wasseen as a temporary defeat for Reagan, who has made aid to the"contra" rebels one of his major foreign policy initiatives.   Congressional leaders, including foes of contra aid, haveacknowledged that despite today's rebuff, which was expected,it will be virtually impossible to prevent the 40 mln dlrs,which was approved last year, from going through.    Even if the Senate goes along with the House in postponingthe aid, Reagan will veto the legislation and Congress is notexpected to be able to override the veto.    But House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, saidtoday's vote was important because it would "send a message" toReagan that his contra program was in trouble. Reuter&#3;
