An income tax surcharge and capitalgains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation ofthe N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and theBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed torestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut bycurrent government policies.    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turnwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 couldbe much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as apercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase wasprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said.    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pctvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationaryimpact of a currency depreciation.    The government had failed to bring inflation down despitelower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year toend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflationpolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates andinsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Baylisssaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debtand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.    "The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems aregoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thoughtis soundly based -- primarily because the government'smacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful," Bayliss said.
