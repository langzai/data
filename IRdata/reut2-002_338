House Majority leader Thomas Foley(D-Wash.) has urged Congress to give the farm credit system afew more months to reorganize itself before rushing into afederal rescue of the system, a senior aide to Foley said.    Gene Moos, agricultural aide to the Majority leader, toldReuters that while Foley believes action will be necessarylater this year to rescue the system, a bail-out package is notnecessarily needed immediately.    Foley's view appears to differ with the Senate leadershipwho have said they hope to have farm credit legislation underconsideration before Congress breaks for Easter April 9.    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) chairman of the SenateAgriculture subcommittee responsible for the farm credit issue,last week pledged to consider a bill before Easter. Boren saidhis subcommittee would proceed even if neither the system'sregulator, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) nor the systemitself ask for aid.    Chairman of the FCA Frank Naylor, like Foley, has expressed caution about rushing to a bail-out, prefering towait a few months and keep pressure on the system to reformitself, farm credit sources said.
