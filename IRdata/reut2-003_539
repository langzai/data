Johnson and Johnson said the U.S.Food and Drug Administration has notified the company its foodadditive petition for a high-intensity sweetener has beenformally accepted and now will be reviewed by the agency.    The company said the product, with the generic name ofsucralose, is made from sugar and tastes like sugar, but isabout 600 times sweeter.    It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay.    Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointlydeveloped with Tate and Lyle PLC &lt;TATL>.    Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the UnitedKingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said.The company noted its petition covering the product and itssafety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.    While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it isproceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeilSpecialty Products Co subsidiary.    Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensingagreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research withscientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to thediscovery of Sucralose in 1976.    Patents and licensing agreements control the use ofsucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.    Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar.The carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are notbroken during digestion or metabolism.    Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. Thechlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories. Reuter&#3;
