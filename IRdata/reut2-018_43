The scale of foreign exchange interventionthe Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof ofBritain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreedbetween the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris inFebruary, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.    Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawsontold reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange ratestability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if hefavoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billionstg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have beenplaying a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitmentstoward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.    "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.    Asked which techniques were available to preservestability, Lawson said both central bank intervention andinterest rate changes could be used to tackle "the marketpressures there are from time to time."    "Interest rate stability is not an objective in thatsense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.    Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" bydraining excess sterling liquidity from the market through newissues of government securities and foreign currency sales,when the market allowed.    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,he said.    "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Notnecessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawsonsaid. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale." REUTER&#3;
