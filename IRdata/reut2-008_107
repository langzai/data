The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd(DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp)in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of onepct.    It said in a report that because of an economic recoveryand higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit isunlikely to face devaluation in the near future.    The report was presented at a two-day investment conferenceorganised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks.    The report said rising commodity prices and the continuedexpansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorousfiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds forcautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.    It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of theyear.    But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's externaldebt remains worrying and should be controlled. It saidMalaysia's external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrsand its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct. REUTER&#3;
