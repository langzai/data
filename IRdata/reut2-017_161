Stocks of paper and lumber producerstumbled as a rumor spread that the Japanese may impose tariffson wood and paper products, analysts and industry officialssaid. But, they said, logic and their own research do notsupport the rumors.    "Apparently a rumor is floating around trading circlesabout the Japanese doing something about tariffs on wood andpaper products," Lowell Moholt, director of investor relationsat Weyerhaeuser Co said. "And we can only assume that thisrumor is one of the factors hurting the stocks."    "I have talked to many people, some with governmentcontacts, and most of them have been mystified by the rumor,"said Moholt.    Nevertheless, International Paper &lt;IP> fell 4-3/8 to95-1/2, Weyerhaeuser Co &lt;WY> two to 51-1/2, Potlatch Corp &lt;PCH>3-1/2 to 69, Great Northern Nekoosa &lt;GNN> 3-1/8 to 85-1/2,Temple Inland Inc &lt;TIN> 2-3/4 to 57-1/4, Boise Cascade 2-3/8 to74-3/8, Georgia Pacific Corp &lt;GP> 1-1/2 to 43-3/4, ChampionInternational Corp &lt;CHA> 1-3/8 to 36-1/2 and Pope and TalbotInc &lt;POP> 1/2 to 36.    "My sources told me there is no grain of truth to theJapanese imposing tariffs," Sherman Chao, analyst with SalomonInc said. "The realities and the logic do not support theserumors," he said.    "The Japanese have a lot more to lose by imposing tariffs.They are running a trade surplus," he said, "and if theystarted a trade war it would hurt them more than the U.S."    Chao said that U.S. producers annually export about twobillion dlrs of forest products to Japan. "Three quarters ofthat is in the form of wood products, meaning logs, wood chipsand lumber, and the balance is paper products."    "They (the Japanese) don't have any domestic sources tomake up for the restrictions," Chao said, "so it's not likethey would put a tariff to protect their own industry."    "The rumors do no make economic sense, and I am skeptical,"analyst Mark Rogers of Prudential Bache Securities said, "butpolitics has been known to override economic concerns."     Speculation has surfaced on Wall Street recently that theJapanese would take action to retaliate against tariffs theReagan Administration imposed last Friday on Japaneseelectronics products.    Rogers said the rumor fueled the profit taking that wasalready occuring in these stocks. "In a nervous market, peopletend to take profits, and they tend to take profits that havebeen the biggest gainers lately." Reuter&#3;
