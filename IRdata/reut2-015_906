AMR Corp's American Airlines will startits own information campaign in its dispute with theAssociation of Professional Flight Attendants.    The company, which has been negotiating with its 10,000attendants since late last year, will give out informationbrochures at its terminals, outlining its position, accordingto L.C. Duncan Jr., vice president of corporate communications.    During a news conference, Duncan said the APFA wasconducting a "smear campaign" by handing out leaflets at thecompany's terminals. The union says it was trying to win publicsupport by presenting its position.     Last month, American fired 20 flight attendants forhanding out the leaflets at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. Theunion is fighting the move in court.     In response to a question, Duncan said the company'slatest proposal for a new three-year contract, which wasoffered March 11, does away with a two-tiered system of pay,whereby new employees are paid on a lower scale than thosehired before 1983.     However, the union has contended that the company'sproposal keeps the system in a disguised form.     A union spoksewoman had no immediate response toAmerican's announcement.     Currently, the airline and the union are in the middle ofa federally-mandated 30-day cooling off period that wastriggered after both sides rejected a federal mediator's offerof binding arbitration.     When the period ends on April 25, the union is free tostrike and the company is free to unilaterally impose itslatest offer under the Federal Railway Labor Act.     Even though the union has repeatedly said it will notstrike, Duncan confirmed today that the company has receivedpermission from the Federal Aviation Administration to speed upthe hiring of new attendants.     In response to a question, Duncan denied the company wasthinking of firing attendants who do not comply after the 25th.     "It (the speeded-up hiring) is a precautionary measure,"he said.
