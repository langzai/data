He told reporters the government organisation had expressedinterest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing toinvest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos ashare.    The shares involved in the proposal were part of the blockof 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank(UCPB) and sequestered by the government.    The block is split between class A and class B stock.    SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N.Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president AndresSoriano, del Rosario said.

Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unitNeptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission onGood Government.
