A plan by European producers to sell854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community interventionstocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at Frenchsugar producer Beghin-Say, said.    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said apossible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producersto withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against ECexport licensing policies.    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail togive producers an equivalent price to that which they would getby offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.    But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair andthat producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offeralready lodged with intervention boards of different Europeancountries. He said final quality approval for all the sugaroffered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had alreadycleared quality specifications.    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into interventionstocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under ECregulations, the Community has until early May to pay for thesugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount ofsugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000tonnes. Reuter&#3;
