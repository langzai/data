Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp willlater today formally ask the U.S. Interstate CommerceCommission (ICC) to reconsider its earlier rejection of themerger of the holding company's railroad assets, a companyspokesman said.    "We expect to file papers late tonight" asking the ICC toreopen the rail merger case, spokesman Rich Hall said in atelephone interview from the company's Chicago headquarters.    The ICC had rejected in July, on grounds it would reducecompetition, the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern PacificRailroads.    The deadline for seeking ICC reconsideration of the mergerplan is midnight tonight.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific owns the Santa Fe railroad andholds the Southern Pacific railroad assets in trust whileawaiting federal approval of the merger plan.    The ICC had ordered the holding company to divest one orthe other railroad but stayed its ruling pending a decision onthe request for reconsideration.    If the ICC ultimately decides not to reopen the case, it isexpected to reinstate the divestiture order. Reuter&#3;
