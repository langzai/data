Southwestern Bell Corp said thatits planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and pagingsystems, including those of &lt;Metromedia Inc>, will result insome initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.    In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, theregional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earningsdilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in itsdebt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt levelwithin an acceptable range.    In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Belllisted a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from43.7 pct in 1985.    In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a sharein 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billiondlrs.    Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have anegative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss ofinvestment tax credits.    By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporatetax rate should have a positive impact on its net income andcash flow.    In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pctgain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pctincrease in long distance calling volumes.    Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will belower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in whichexpenditures were held below budget. Reuter&#3;
