The EC agriculture ministers' agreement onreducing dairy output puts milk producers in an impossiblesituation, French farm unions said.    The accord to limit butter sales into intervention, part ofplanned dairy output cuts of 9-1/2 pct over two years, will cutmilk producers' income, a spokeswoman for France's largest farmunion, the FNSEA, said.    The move has destroyed part of the Common AgriculturalPolicy, French milk producers said in a press release.    But Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume saidrepercussions of the plan will affect dairies, not farmers.    "If there are negative repercussions, it will be at thelevel of the dairies which have never looked for new outletsfor butter and milk," he told journalists during a visit toRouen.    FNSEA president Raymond Lacombe said on French radio themilk sector needs restructuring by encouraging early retirementand helping young farmers to start. But Commission proposals,rejected by ministers, would have frozen land prices, he said.    The FNSEA says it will demonstrate over Commissionproposals to freeze most 1987/88 farm prices and cut supports.Pig farmers have held violent demonstrations over falling porkprices and milk producers blocked roads in protest at cuts inmilk output.
