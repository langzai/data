Exxon Corp said in its annual reportthat it raised production in 1986 although it did not replaceall oil and gas produced.    The company said that it added about four pct to productionbringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, basedlargely on increased production of oil overseas but additionsto its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitionsdid not replace all of the oil and gas produced.    The company said that the average price for oil and gasdeclined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.    Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.    Exxon said that its principal gains in production came fromthe Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and fromoil sands in Canada.    Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres forexpoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europeand the Far East.    But capital expenditures for exploration and productionwere cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous yearand further reductions were expected in 1987.    Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gasliquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reacheda new high of 422,000 bpd.    The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Seafields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able tosell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lowerquality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgradedover the past several years.    The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxonmore of a spread in its refinery operations and added toearnings gains from refining and marketing.    Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operationsrose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrsin 1985.    The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runsrose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.    Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinerycompleted last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project inRotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudesto extract higher proportions of light products.
