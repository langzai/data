The Bank of France expects a continuedrevival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook forany improvement in France's record 10.9 pct unemployment rateremains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review.    The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except theagro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fallin January, while construction and civil engineeringexperienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over thenext few months.    Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, inparticular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said.    Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exceptionof the agro-food industry, improved substantially.    In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised lastmonths.    Production rose in all sectors except agriculturalmachinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and shipconstruction, where it declined.    The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn inactivity in February, with both domestic and export ordersrising.    In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despitea fall in the household goods sector and stability inpharmaceuticals.    Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helpedby a strong growth in construction materials.    But activity in the retail sector declined slightly overthe past two months. REUTER&#3;
