U.S. Senate Budget CommitteeChairman Lawton Chiles' (D-Fla.) fiscal 1988 budget plan wouldcut farm spending by about two billion dlrs, primarily bymaking unspecified changes in price and income supportprograms, Senate staff members said.    Chiles presented his budget blueprint late last week andsaid he would like to begin voting on it this week.    Senate Republican staff members said Chiles wasrecommending that policy changes be adopted for 1988 crops.    While savings from the changes would accrue mainly infiscal 1989, Chiles said his income and price support proposalswould trim about two billion dlrs from advance deficiencypayments, most of which would be made in the spring of nextyear.    It was not clear how the Senate Budget panel head wouldachieve the savings in Commodity Credit Corp outlays. Aides toChiles would not comment on how the CCC savings would be made.    Recently the Congressional Budget Office released a reportlisting possible price and income support program savings.    The options included lowering target prices, increasingunpaid acreage reduction programs, targeting income supportpayments to specific groups of producers, limiting the use ofgeneric commodity certificates, raising loan rates and"decoupling" income support payments from production decisions.    Chiles proposed saving about 100 mln dlrs by freezing theU.S. Agriculture Department's discretionary spending functionswhich include research and credit programs, Senate staff said.    The Florida senator's plan also would provide 30 mln dlrsfor organic farming research and 20 mln dlrs for homeless aid. Reuter&#3;
