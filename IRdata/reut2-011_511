Texaco Inc said that it had no commentin response to a statement by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> chairman J.Hugh Liedtke that any settlement with Texaco must be above thetwo billion dlrs range.    "We have no commment at this time. We have said in the pastthat we were willing to discuss a reasonable and economicsettlement but have no comment now," a Texaco spokeswoman saidin response to a Reuter inquiry.    Liedtke told a group of security analysts in New york, "ifanyone thinks this (litigation) could be setled in the twobillion dlrs range, they're not being realistic."    Liedtke also told analysts Pennzoil would consider anyreasonable settlement in its ongoing 11.0-billion-dlr suit withTexaco.    Neither Pennzoil nor Texaco has said that any talks werepresently underway to resolve the dispute that arose whenPennzoil charged Texaco had improperly wrested control of GettyCorp from Pennzoil.
