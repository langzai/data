The meeting will provide senior government officials withtheir first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of thedollar, although the main focus of the gathering is longerterm, they said.    Deputy Finance Ministers, including Japanese Vice-FinanceMinister Toyoo Gyohten, will attend. The meeting will be heldin Italy, they said, but gave no other details.

Japanese officials admitted there is little more they cando on their own to stem the dollar decline, which last week sawthe currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen.    The officials said they expected sentiment against thedollar to change soon, once the U.S. Trade deficit starts tofall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink.
