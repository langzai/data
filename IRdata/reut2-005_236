Japanese banks may have to realizesignificant losses on their seven billion dlrs in perpetualfloating rate notes after the recent collapse of the market,bankers said.    How much of a loss is realized in the current fiscal yearending March 31 depends on the accounting treatment recommendedby the Finance Ministry. Ministry sources said the Ministry hasyet to decide what guidance to give Japanese banks in valuingthe perpetual floating rate notes they hold.    The notes are held by Japanese city, trust, long-term andregional banks, including their overseas branches.    Roughly half of the Japanese banks assess foreign assetportfolios on the basis of current market prices while theothers assess them at either the acquisition cost or thecurrent market price, whichever is lower, bankers said.    With the market for such perpetuals non-existent, FinanceMinistry officials questioned the propriety of using nominalquotations supplied by the notes' lead managers to determinebank book losses.    The Ministry is currently awaiting a legal judgement by theNational Tax Administration Agency on the propriety of usingsuch quotations, one official said.    Banks using current market prices alone to value theirholdings can avoid realizing losses now because they can arguethat the market is non-existent and hope for a recovery nextyear, bankers said.    But those banks who use acquisition cost to value foreignportfolios cannot look to the market, bankers said. Theacquisition cost is obviously higher than the market price,whatever it may be, these banks must realize losses in thecurrent fiscal year. REUTER&#3;
