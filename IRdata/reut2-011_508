The groups are seeking a special meeting to call for an endto sales to the South African police and military, andwithdrawal from South Africa, it said.    Royal Dutch spokesman Eric Steneker told Reutersshareholders were entitled to discuss any matter relating toShell at May's annual general meeting. "In fact, Shell in SouthAfrica has been discussed at every meeting of shareholders formore than 10 years," Steneker said.
