OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman accused"oil market manipulators" of drawing down their own stocks andspreading rumours to give the impression OPEC was breaking its15.8 mln barrels per day output ceiling, set last December.    Lukman told reporters the aim was to pull prices below the18 dlrs per barrel reference level set by OPEC.    "People are playing a waiting game to test the will of OPECby drawing down more on their stock than normal, and this ishaving the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on themarket which we know is not real," Lukman said.    Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said that despite probable"minor deviations" by one or two member countries, "basically OPECis producing around what it said it would produce."    After OPEC's price and production accord last December, themarket firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week toaround 16 dlrs. Industry reports estimated the organization wasproducing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during February.    But Lukman was confident OPEC would maintain itsdiscipline, in view of past experience. "We have the experienceof what happened in 1986 behind us, when violations ofagreements led to the collapse of the market," he said.    Lukman was in Kingston as a guest of the state-ownedPetroleum Corp of Jamaica. REUTER&#3;
