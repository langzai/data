U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the collapse of British share prices this week heldno implication so far for domestic interest rates.    He said in a television interview that "there is nothing inthe events of the past few days to increase the upward pressureon (U.K.) interest rates."    Sterling has so far stayed solid during the crisis, backedby strong economic fundamentals and by 10 pct bank base lendingrates, analysts said. Lawson's comments followed anotherfrantic day in London's financial center, where British sharesclosed 12.2 pct down on the day. Reuter&#3;
