&lt;Royal Bank of Canada> said itestimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlrincrease over last year.    Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continueddebt-servicing problems ... in the North American energyindustry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and alsocontinued to add to its general provisions for loans totroubled borrower countries.    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter endedJanuary 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in theyear-ago quarter.    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loanlosses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0billion dlrs a year ago.    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman AllanTaylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loansassociated with the energy sector--continue to have asubstantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.    Taylor said profitability of the bank's internationaloperations remains weak, reflecting resource-relateddifficulties of private and public sector borrowers andunsatisfactory results from capital market activities.    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on theoutcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or theirpotential impact on the Royal Bank.    The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago. Reuter&#3;
