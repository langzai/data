Mexico has temporarily suspended itsdebt-equity swap program in a move that some bankers see as anattempt to increase pressure on reluctant foreign banks toparticipate in a new 7.7 billion dlr loan for the country.    The scheme, which gives foreign firms access to cheap pesosto finance investment in Mexico, is likely to resume soon afterthe loan package is signed on March 20.    But the move is a further indication of the strains thathave developed between Mexico and the banks because of thedifficulty of syndicating the huge loan, bankers said.    Bankers said that Mexico suspended the swap program onFebruary 25.    Adolfo Hegewisch, Mexico's Undersecretary for Commerce,confirmed that the swap program had been halted, but he told aEuromoney conference on debt-equity swaps that Mexico had beenforced to act because it had been inundated with applications.    Between January 1 and February 15, 132 firms had applied todo a debt-equity conversion, compared with 100 between May andDecember 1986. "We were not accustomed to receive so muchwork," said Hegewisch, who is responsible for foreigninvestment in Mexico.    Bankers said applications totalling two billion dlrs hadpiled up at the finance ministry, which has said it wants tolimit the amount of swaps to 100 mln dlrs a month.    But some bankers, who declined to be identified, said thehalt also suited Mexico as it would keep up pressure on thebanks during the final campaign to persuade all 400 creditorsworldwide to participate in the loan.    Over 97 pct of the loan has been subscribed, but dozens ofsmaller banks are still baulking. Assistant U.S. TreasurySecretary David Mulford said yesterday that the reluctance ofthese banks had nearly jeopardized the deal at one stage.    "The Mexicans basically said, We're not going to subsidizeforeigners until we have a deal," one banker said.    Other bankers, however, said Mexico's motives were not sosinister and that the suspension was mainly due to the absenceof top ministry officials in New York for the debt talks.    "They want to focus on the deal, and they wanted the banksto focus on the deal," one source said.    Apart from the present disruption, bankers and companyofficials said the Mexican debt-equity scheme has been a hugesuccess.        Frank Fountain, Assistant Treasurer at Chrysler Corp, saida 100 mln dlr swap it made in December had gone so smoothlythat Chrysler has plans for more.    Chrysler, working through Manufacturters Hanover Trust Co,bought Mexican public-sector debt with a face value of 110 mlndlrs, mainly from European banks. The cost was about 65 mlndlrs in cash and paper.    It then presented the paper to Mexico's central bank andreceived the equivalent of 100 mln dlrs worth of pesos which itinvested in its local subsidiary to produce cars for export toNorth America.    Susan Segal, senior vice president of ManufacturersHanover, said the swaps not only reduce Mexico's debt burdenbut help to recapitalize local industries that may have beensqueezed out of the local capital markets.    Fountain said that even a large well-established firm suchas Chrysler had found it difficult to arrange long-term pesofinancing on reasonable terms in Mexico.    Industrial companies have done most of the swaps to date,and Hegewisch said that many of the applications now pendingare for investments in the electronic and chemical industries,with Japanese and Korean firms showing particular interest.    But the interest is spreading. Segal said ManufacturersHanover has been authorized to convert part of its ownportfolio of loans into equity investment in Mexican hotels.    She said the sums involved are considerable, but gave nodetails. The bank is also looking into joint ventures withmanufacturing and trading companies, Segal added.    And, as part of the agreement with the banks that will besigned next week, Mexican residents will be allowed toparticipate in the scheme, hitherto reserved for foreign firms,in the hope that some of the 30 billion dlrs estimated to beheld abroad will be repatriated.
