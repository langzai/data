Worsening drought conditions in Pekingmay force the authorities to ration water for industry andfarming this summer, the New China news Agency said.    The agency quoted city officials as saying rainfall lastyear was 75 millimetres lower than in 1985, and its two mainreservoirs are now only one-quarter full.    Peking's underground water level is 60 centimetres lowerthan last year, reducing daily supplies by 50,000 tons.    The officials said daily water supplies in urban Pekingwill fall 160,000 to 260,000 tons short of demand during thehottest days this summer.    They called for stricter control of water consumption andgreater recycling of water, adding that there was no hope ofalleviating the shortage until a new water mill starts up inone year's time.
