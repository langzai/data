Outgoing United States AmbassadorStephen Bosworth told a news conference he did not think thePhilippines would follow Brazil's example and suspend interestpayments on foreign loans from commercial banks.    "I see no evidence that the Philippine government evencontemplates doing that. It has said at the outset that itaccepts the legitimacy of these debts and it is determined overtime to meet its obligations fully," he said.    Philippine officials and a 12-bank committee have beenmeeting for the past four weeks in New York in a bid toreschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of foreign debt.    Bosworth said the United States strongly supports Manila'sbid to put its international financial situation in order andthat the private bank creditors were aware of that.    "I think there is no question that the private banks areaware of the views of the U.S. Government ... I am confidentthey will take those views into account when they make theirown decisions," Bosworth said.    He added: "These are private banks. They are responsible totheir shareholders and they have to make their decisions ontheir own. But I am confident they understand the views of theUnited States and our strong support." REUTER&#3;
