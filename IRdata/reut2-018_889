Kraft Inc said it strongly disagreedwith a complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission that itmade false and misleading claims about its Kraft Singles cheeseproduct and said it would fight the charge.    "Kraft has always been committed to informative andtruthful advertising and this compaign clearly meets thosecriteria," Kraft said in a prepared statement.    "We believe the integreity of the advertising will beestablished through the litigation process," Kraft said.    Company spokesman Scott Horne said he could not elaborateon the statement because the case is being litigated.    The FTC charged Kraft with making false and misleadingclaims in its advertising by overstating the calcuim content ofits Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Process Cheese Food.    In an administrative complaint, the FTC charged theGlenview, Ill., food and consumer products company with falselyclaiming that a slice of Kraft Singles contains the same amountof calcium as five ounces of milk.    The company also falsely advertised that Kraft Singlescontain more calcium than most slices of imitation cheese andthat it could substantiate its claims, the FTC charged. Reuter&#3;
