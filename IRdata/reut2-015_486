China is likely to succeed in joiningGATT despite policies that contradict free trade, becausewestern countries support its entry, western diplomats said.    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 tointegrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80pct of world trade.    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list ofdetailed questions to China next month at the start of long andcomplex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with itsapplication supported by the United States, Japan and theEuropean Community for political and economic reasons.    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would drawback the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept theSoviet Union," he said. "China's agreement will be seen as amodel for the Soviet Union. GATT is not a political body."    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs andpromote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establishthe real cost of goods because many prices are set by the stateand often contain subsidies. Reuter&#3;
