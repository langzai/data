Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said heregards a U.S. Dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreementstruck by major nations in Paris last month.    He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament thatJapan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150yen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that levelcounter to the spirit of the Paris accord.    Commenting on current foreign exchange movements, Miyazawasaid Japan would watch developments for another couple of days.    Institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars tohedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial yeartoday, Miyazawa said.    Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perceptionthat major nations were not doing enough to implement theirpolicies under the Paris pact, he said, noting that passage ofJapan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.    He said that now was the time for major nations to actunder the Paris accord. The U.S., West Germany, France,Switzerland and Britain have intervened on their own account toprop up the dollar, he said. This was a concerted action. REUTER&#3;
