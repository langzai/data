Elements of the drug industry endangeredthe lives of children by pressuring the government to delay anow common warning on the link between aspirin and an oftenfatal disease, a doctor said.    The warning involving Reye's Syndrome has since beenrequired on aspirin products under a Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) directive of one year ago, and now appearson the labels of aspirin and aspirin-containing products.    The industry under government coaxing began voluntarilyprinting warning labels in mid-1985.       But in an editorial in this week's Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, Dr Edward Mortimer of CaseWestern Reserve University in Cleveland said some aspirinmanufacturers misled physicians and acted irresponsibly inopposing the warning for several years before then.    Mortimer's criticism was prompted by a new government studypublished in the same issue of the Journal which said it hadfound a "strong association" between aspirin and Reye's Syndrome.    Reye's Syndrome, which kills about 20 per cent of itsvictims, strikes following chicken pox, influenza and other illnesses. Symptoms include lethargy, belligerence andexcessive vomiting. Those who survive sometimes suffer braindamage.   Reuter&#3;
