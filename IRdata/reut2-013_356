The French treasury has decided to repay680 mln francs of debt issued before 1950, the Finance Ministrysaid.    Seven issues, accounting for 0.13 pct of total statedomestic debt, would be redeemed by the Caisse d Amortisementde la Dette Publique, the national debt amortisation fund, aMinistry statement said.    The Ministry said the debt rationalisation exercise,similar to one carried out in 1958 and 1959, would take out ofcirculation old issues which were expensive to manage anddifficult to trade because of their highly complex structure.    Technical details of the operation would be announced inthe next few days.    The securities to be redeemed would be the three pctperpetual rente, five pct perpetual rente, four pct 1941-1960redeemable rentes, 3.5 pct 1942-1952 redeemable rentes, threepct 1942-1955 redeemable rentes, three pct 1945-1954 redeemablerentes, and 4.5 pct 1933-1960 redeemable treasury bonds.
