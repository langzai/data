The economy will grow by an averagerate of 2.2 pct a year in real terms between now and the end of1991, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) said in anannual report.    A year ago WestLB had forecast average growth of just underthree pct for 1986-1990.    The 1987 report said gross national product would onlyexpand a real 1.7 pct this year -- below previous expectations-- because of weaker exports. Growth rates will pick up later,however, producing a 2.2 pct increase on average for thefive-year period. MORE&#3;
