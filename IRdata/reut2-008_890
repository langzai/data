Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by ExxonCorp &lt;XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strengthand improving near-term earnings performance through operatingexpense reductions and selective capital spending, the companysaid in the annual report.    Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs oncapital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.    Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fellto 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27dlrs share in the prior year.    Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results fromthe desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities shouldthe investment climate improve and the belief that low orvolatile crude oil prices could continue during the nextseveral years.    The company also said actions initiated during 1986 torestructure and improve efficiency should continue to showbenefits in 1987.    During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative andmarketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number ofworkers by 16 pct to 12,500.    Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual reportthat it is too early to determine whether the recent upwardmovement in international oil prices will be sustained.    "It is still a time for prudence and caution, and thecompany's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentalsof market supply and demand," he said.    Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum productsdivision are more promising than before, but are stilluncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mlndlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.    Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on itspetroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has inthe United States.    The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynessaid. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good aslong as economic growth continues, but future large grainsurpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressureon prices.    Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986,compared to three mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter&#3;
