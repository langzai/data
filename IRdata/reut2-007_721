Rep William Gray (D-Pa), Chairman ofthe House Budget Committee, abruptly canceled the committee'sbudget writing process when Republican members said they wouldcontinue a vote strike begun yesterday.    "I'm not going to continue a markup in which my Republicancolleagues won't participate," Gray told reporters.    He said he asked Republicans to tell him by Monday whetherthey would vote in future open sessions.    If they choose not to, he threatened to again draft abudget behind closed doors with only Democrats present, as hadbeen done the previous two years.    "If they do not want to participate in an open process ...then I will make a decision as to how the Democrats willproceed," Gray said.    "If there is not possibility of Republican participation, Iwill go back to what we've done in the past," he said.    Republicans yesterday had voted "present" in a series ofcommittee votes on fiscal 1988 defense spending.    The Republicans had said they were protesting theDemocrats' failure to present alternatives to PresidentReagan's budget. Reuter&#3;
