Britoil Plc's &lt;BTOL.L> explorationexpenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about athird of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure wouldremain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walkersaid.    He told reporters following the release of the company's1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986levels.    U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in1985.    Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinarycharge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The resultswere slightly better than analysts forecast and the sharefirmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman SirPhilip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986had made the period extremely difficult but the company hadcome through remarkably well.    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, theconditions would be right for a substantially improvedperformance this year.    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, whenthey were normally weaker, made him "a bit encouraged" about theprospects for future levels.    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the pricestayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcementof a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by thelatter part of April.    End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil comparedwith 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that thisincluded a revised definition of reserves.    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, thereserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrelspreviously.    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from arestated 3,660 billion.&#3;
