Trade estimates of the comingMay/September temporao harvest in Brazil's main cocoa growingstate of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bagrange against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago.    Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters theeffects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year hadbeen harsher than thought earlier.    Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains inmid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.    Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mlnbags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.    The traders said another factor leading to lower croppredictions is that many farmers are not caring properly forplantations because of low returns on their investment.    Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back asfarmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over thepast six months coupled with low bean prices.    If such economies continue into the winter months both thetemporao and the developing October/April main crop could faceserious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which wouldnormally be treated against the disease.    Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolatedincidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions saythese are not yet significant.    The traders said they expect very low deliveries oftemporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and thebulk will not appear until the last month, September.    Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellentcondition and recent flowering and pod setting - which willlead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good. Reuter&#3;
