Northern Indiana Public Service Cosaid its five-year construction budget for 1987-1991 will be793 mln dlrs, almost all of which will be internally generated.    The utility said in its 1986 annual report that thisbudget, primarily for electric and gas equipment andfacilities, is some 57 mln dlrs lower than its estimate a yearago of spending for 1986-1990. Such spending at its peak was2.6 billion dlrs for 1980-1984.    It said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will probably not have amaterial effect on its operating results. In December it cut59.4 mln dlrs from a 135.8 mln dlrs rate request before theIndiana Public Service Commission because of the affect the taxact will have on operating results.    The rate request is still pending, a spokesman said. Reuter&#3;
