After battling President Reagan allyear, Congress is about to pass a trillion dollar 1988 budgetthat sets the stage for even fiercer fighting over its tax anddefence policies.    But when the dust settles, congressional budget analystssay, Reagan and the Democratic opposition may finally sit downat a "budget summit" to call a truce and work out a deal overimplementing the budget he opposes.    "I think he essentially will (negotiate)," said a prominentHouse leader who did not want to be identified. "The ball is inhis court ... We've done everything we could to make a summit."The Democrat budget plan calls for $19 billion in new taxesnext year, $64 billion over three years, and is set to bepassed by the Democratic-led Congress next week. It would cutnext year's deficit by about $37 billion to $134 billion.    On Tuesday last week, Reagan said he would consider talks,except on defence or taxes, but three days later argued thatCongress would first have to bend even further. Reuter&#3;
