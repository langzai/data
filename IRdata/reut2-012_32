Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>, the Japaneseelectronics group which plans to enter Britain's liberalisedtelecommunications equipment market, risks becoming the firstcasualty in the current war of words over trade between Japanand the U.K., Government and industry sources said.    U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese tradingpractices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate withoutunleashing a damaging trade war. "Toshiba's timing seems mostunfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we arelooking for someone to punch," one official told Reuters.    Earlier, &lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd> said itwanted to enter the British business facsimile and keytelephone market. A facsimile machine sends printed data overtelephone lines, while a key telephone system is used forswitching calls within a business, industry sources said.    The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute overJapan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market toforeign companies. "Toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," oneofficial at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.    Tommorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legalaction it can possible take to press for Japanese reform.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that theU.K. Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to preventCable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> from taking a significantposition in a new Japanese international telecommunicationsventure. "We regard this as a test case," she told Parliament.    But while the U.K. Is keen to see some movement on theissue by Japan, it is also worried that recent anti-Japaneserhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officialssaid.    Japanese officials in Tokyo today reiterated that Japan hadno plans to bow to U.K. And U.S. Pressure to give foreigntelecommunications firms a bigger role there.reuter^M&#3;
