The U.S. Departments of Agricultureand Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund theincreasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vesselsunder a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.    Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a HouseAgriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the twodepartments are negotiating a "memorandum of understanding" oncargo preference.    Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of foodaid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to graduallyincrease over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased costof using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the TransportationDepartment instead of USDA. However, USDA officials saidTransportation has so far contributed no money.    The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expectedto resolve the matter, USDA officials said.    Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign AgriculturalService said yesterday the requirement that more food aidshipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult tomeet.    "As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,its going to be harder and harder to meet," Kay said.    Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and GlennEnglish (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm exportprograms more costly and the program should be eliminated.    In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preferencehave been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests whoview cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet. Reuter&#3;
