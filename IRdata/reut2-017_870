Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over theemirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejectedcharges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spyboats.    "There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranianaccusation on the nature of the operations of the vesselsrecently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were outfishing," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.    It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri wassummoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with ForeignUndersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.    The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seizedseven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, whoconfessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.    It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullahwaterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at thehead of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.    The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured GulfArab states saying responsibility for security and stability inthe waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team wasscheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and PrimeMinister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence andoil ministers.    Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the KuwaitNews Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishingvessels by Iran was not the first.    Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwaithad sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.    "However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iraniancharges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels wereundertaking espionage activities," it said.    Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and askedTehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, thestatement said. REUTER&#3;
