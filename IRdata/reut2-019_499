Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl saidWest Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates andthat he believed the economy would continue to recover after asix-month lull.    Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interestrates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: "We would bebadly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.    "This could, under certain circumstances, release newinflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead tohigher interest rates," he added.    Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the pastsix months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.    "But since April, statistics clearly show that the economyfinds itself on a course of growth," he said. "I expect thisdevelopment to continue in the coming months."    Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Communitytrade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.    "For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used byprotectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts," he added. "Thisincludes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as faras possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S." Reuter&#3;
