Britain is not considering anyrestriction of its present oil production, UK Energy MinisterAlick Buchanan-Smith said.     Speaking to reporters at the Offshore TechnologyConference, Buchanan-Smith said, "No, we've made thatabsolutely clear, we see no reason for changing (the productionlevel)."     Earlier today, Buchanan-Smith gave the go-ahead to MobilCorp for two new North Sea developments -- the Ness oil fieldand Beryl B subsea water injection project -- totalling 96 mlndlrs (60 mln British pounds).     Unlike Norway, which has restricted its production ofNorth Sea oil by 80,000 barrels a day in an effort to stabilizeworld oil prices, Britain has consistently refused to intervenein the market place.     Buchanan-Smith also said there may be a demand-supply gapin the 1990s for natural gas in Britain, but added that itwould probably be less than had been previously estimated.     Norway is a major producer of natural gas and this morningNorway's Energy Minister Arne Oien said he was hoping Britainwill take more Norwegian gas in the 1990s.     Buchanan-Smith also said he expects to announce theresults of the 10th licensing round of North Sea tracts nextmonth.     He said there had been 75 applications for 127 tracts by84 companies, and added that he expects about 50 blocks will belicensed.     He said the results would be in line with rounds prior tobut not equal to the ninth two years ago, which was one of themost successful ever. Reuter&#3;
