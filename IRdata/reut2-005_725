The quotas will restrict the conversion of farmland tofarmers' housing or construction by state departments andcollective institutions and enterprises.    The newspaper quoted Wang Xianjin, general director of theState Land Administration, as saying the 1987 quota would bebelow the 320,000 hectares lost in 1985.
