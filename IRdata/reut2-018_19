Italy's barley crop is generally in goodcondition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, theagricultural marketing information and research board Irvamsaid.    First consignments were expected to be available aroundmid-June.    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods ofsunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,which was expected to lose a large part of its barley cropbecause of extreme dryness.    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's lowlevels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, nationalproduction would be around two pct higher than in the previousseason at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.    If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achievedin 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, anincrease of 11 pct compared to 1986. Reuter&#3;
