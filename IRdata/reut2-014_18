Gold and silver closed off the day'shighs on profit-taking, but silver, which continued to set thepace, remained well up on yesterday's close, dealers said.    Underlying speculative demand for silver remained strongbut profit-taking eroded the gains, taking the metal offindicated highs at around 6.80 dlrs to close at 6.64/66 dlrs anounce. Yesterday's close was 6.52/54 dlrs.    Some investors were noted selling gold and switching intosilver. This combined with profit-taking to push gold down to aclose of 418.50/419.00 dlrs from its opening 421.80/422.20 andyesterday's 421.50/422.00.    Dealers said it was unclear if the silver rally had peakedor if fresh gains could be achieved in New York.    "A lot depends on the Dow Jones index," one dealer commented."Further gains in stock prices would take away a lot of thesupport for silver and gold."    Platinum ended 50 cents higher at 563/567 dlrs. REUTER&#3;
