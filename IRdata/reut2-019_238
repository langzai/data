Cold and wet weather in northern,western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beetgrowth but plant density is reported to be good in mostcountries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.    Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain hashampered field work and occasionally led to water-loggedfields.    But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather hasboosted sugar beet growth.    Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beetdevelopment, Licht said.    In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plantpopulation is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainyweather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects arerated as slightly below normal.    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool withheavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, itwas mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall whichcontinued to slow down beet growth and often made field workimpossible.    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which wasfavourable for beet growth, Licht said.    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouringbeet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,it was warm with showers over most areas and weather wasgenerally good for the emergence and growth of beets.    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfallboosted beet development.    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputesbetween the factories and the trade unions are threatening todelay the start of processing in the southern areas, wherebeets are maturing very early this year. Reuter&#3;
