The outcome of negotiations onproposals by the European Commission for a 330 Ecus a tonne taxon EC-produced and imported oilseeds and marine oils remainsdifficult to predict, Belgian agriculture minister Paul deKeersmaeker told a news conference.    De Keersmaeker, who chaired a meeting of EC farm ministerswhich ended today, was asked about reports enough countrieswere against the tax to ensure that it would be defeated innegotiations on the EC farm price package for 1987/88.    He said it was true some countries were strongly opposed,but others were less so and others basically in favour.    "I think there is room for negotiations, and I would notwant to make any predictions at this stage," de Keersmaekersaid.    Yesterday, British minister Michael Jopling said Britain,West Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and Denmark wereopposed to the measure. Between them these countries have morethan enough voting power to block it.    Diplomatic sources said at today's meeting the Spanishdelegation also expressed strong reservations about the idea.
