CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> said it expected tomake an announcement next week which would have a significantand beneficial impact on the future of the company.    It said the statement was prompted by heavy turnover in CSRshares. Brokers said Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> today sold24.2 mln CSR shares representing almost five pct of thecompany. CSR closed 20 cents higher at 4.20 dlrs on a nationalturnover of 31.39 mln shares.    Share analysts said the CSR announcement could be about theexpected flotation of its &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd> unit,releasing cash for a major building products aquisition.    CSR forecast in January it would float Delhi and said itexpected to invest close to 100 mln dlrs on acquisitions inbuilding materials both in Australia and offshore.    One analyst, who asked not to be named, said about 25 pctof Delhi could be offered to CSR shareholders in an arrangementwhich would preserve the tax position of the Cooper Basin oiland gas producer, which is held in a trust.    CSR had now finished paying for Delhi, after last yearwriting down large foreign exchange losses on loans to buy thecompany and selling such investments as its share of the MountNewman iron ore project, the analyst said.    CSR had restructured its management in recent months andwas redirecting its efforts into industrial divisions from itsresources business, analysts told Reuters. It could be expectedto also float its coal interests, they said.    The company earlier this month said it would sell its fiveSydney head office buildings.    Stuart McKibbin of Melbourne broker &lt;A.C. Goode and Co Ltd>said CSR had till now been overlooked by many of the offshoreinvestors now heavily buying Australian gold and resourcestocks. That climate could prove an ideal time to float the CSRpetroleum division, he said. REUTER&#3;
