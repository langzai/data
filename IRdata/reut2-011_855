Coastal Corp said its board will beasked to approve the company's plan to reorganize&lt;Transamerican Natural Gas Corp> at its April 14 meeting.    Coastal said the plan is expected to be filed with thefederal Bankruptcy Court on April 15.    Transamerican has been operating under Chapter 11 of thefederal bankruptcy code since January 1983. Owned by John R.Stanley, it was formerly known as GHR Energy Corp. Thebankruptcy arose from the collapse of GHR's Good HopeRefineries Inc, which operated a refinery at Good Hope, La.    Coastal also said it will file detailed objections to thedisclosure statement filed earlier by Transamerican.    Coastal has requested its plan and disclosure statement beset for hearing in Bankruptcy Court Judge Manuel Leal's courton April 28 and 29 along with the Transamerican plan.    Coast said a ruling this week by Judge Leal freed thecompany to work with Transamerican's creditors and otherinterested parties in developing a reorganization plan. Reuter&#3;
