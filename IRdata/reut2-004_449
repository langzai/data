Director of the Office of Managementand Budget James Miller said the Reagan administration had nointention of raising taxes in order to reduce the federalbudget deficit.     "There will be no tax increases," he said three timesbefore a Management Briefing luncheon of Southern MethodistUniversity's Edwin L. Cox School of Business.     The budget deficit, which is currently slated at 173billion dlrs for fiscal 1988, is supposed to be reduced to 108billion dlrs under the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman Act,which calls for a balanced budget by fiscal 1991.     Miller said he believes the budget deficit can be reducedbut added, "the surest way to put us in a pickle" would be toraise or ease the Gramm-Rudman goal.     "If we were to raise taxes so soon after tax reform, itwould create enormous uncertainty on the financial markets," hesaid, adding that giving up on the will to reduce the deficitwould also create uncertainty.     Miller reiterated the president's budget proposal that thedeficit could be reduced by a total of 42 billion dlrs throughincreased revenues and spending cuts. An additional 23 billiondlrs from economic growth is expected to result in the budgetdeficit being reduced to the 108 billion dlr target.     Miller said it was possible the Administration mightsupport an oil import fee, but added that the President wasconcerned that such a move might have more adverse results thanbenefits.     He also said the Administration was seeking to spin offAmtrak, which costs the government about 500 mln dlrs a year,but added that he did not expect it to be accomplished thisyear.
