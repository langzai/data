Standard and Poor's Corp said itaffirmed the ratings on W.R. Grace and Co's 575 mln dlrs ofdebt following its fourth-quarter 1986 loss of 560 mln dlrs.    Affirmed were the company's BBB-minus senior debt, BB-plussubordinated debt and A-3 commercial paper.    S and P pointed out that the fourth-quarter loss resultedfrom the write-off of nearly 600 mln dlrs in assets, especiallyin agricultural chemicals and natural resources.    Because that write-off had no effect on Grace's cash, S andP affirmed the current ratings, noting that Grace intends tosell its agricultural business.    Proceeds from the sale of the agricultural segment could beused to reduce Grace's debt, Standard and Poor's said.    However, S and P said it is less clear whether Grace canalso extricate itself from the project debt from its phosphatemining joint venture at Four Corners.    Despite today's rating affirmation, S and P cautioned thatGrace has greater-than-usual vulnerability to rating change inthe next year or two.    "Uncertainty abounds as to the firm's future ownership,management and direction," the rating agency said. Reuter&#3;
