American Motors Corp said its auditorsqualified the company's 1986 financial report.    The report was qualified due to uncertainties surroundingthe previously announced arbitration award against AmericanMotors' former subsidiary, AM General Corp. The award is beingcontested.    The report was filed today with the Securities and ExchangeCommission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's &lt;C> proposal totake over American Motors.    American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award,made to Emerson Electric Co &lt;EMR> in February, amounted to 60mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challengedthe award.    The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp &lt;QLTV>in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billiondlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM Generallast year sought protection under Chapter 11.    The arbitration proceeding was called after EmersonElectric charged AM General violated an agreement covering thedevelopment of certain components in the contract.    The components were for the military's "High MobilityMulti-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle" (HMMWV), American Motors said.    In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed toindemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from theEmerson Electric claims.    AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court,and faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because ofthe LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of aconfirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain. Reuter&#3;
