About 300 local representatives on theUnited Automobile Workers union's General Motors Corpbargaining council convened at a Detroit hotel this morning forprivate strategy sessions in the run-up to this summer'snational contract bargaining covering 380,000 UAW members atGM.    AlThough the sessions were closed to the press, UAWvice-president Donald Ephlin urged delegates in a bargainingdocument obtained by Reuters to be "willing to use creative andnon-traditional means in achieving our bargaining goals."    The document calls outsourcing of GM's production work toforeign or non-GM operations "perhaps the greatest singlethreat to the job security of our members" and urges bargainersto seek an expansion of limits on the giant automaker's abilityto outsource.    While saying that outsourcing pits "worker against worker"and the UAW "will not tolerate this practice," the documentfalls short of demanding an outright ban on the practice andinstead calls for improvements in "current provisions andrestrictions on outsourcing."    The union said its barginers must seek bans against plantand work place closings "similar to those included in our 1982and 1984 contracts."    In addition, the UAW said, "full resumption of ourtraditional wage formula is a top priority in this set ofnegotiations."    While the document does not specify a percentage wageincrease, the UAW's traditional standard before makingconcessions in 1982 was a three pct annual wage increase withbenefits calculated from the base wage rate.
