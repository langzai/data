House Majority leader Thomas Foley(D-Wash.) has urged Congress to give the farm credit system afew more months to reorganize itself before rushing into afederal rescue of the system, a senior aide to Foley said.    Gene Moos, agricultural aide to the Majority leader, toldReuters while Foley believes action will be necessary laterthis year to rescue the system, a bail-out package is notnecessarily needed immediately.    Foley's view appears to differ with the Senate leadershipwho have said they hope to have farm credit legislation underconsideration before Congress breaks for Easter April 9.    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) chairman of the SenateAgriculture subcommittee responsible for the farm credit issue,last week pledged to consider a bill before Easter. Boren saidhis subcommittee would proceed even if neither the system'sregulator, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) nor the systemitself ask for aid.    Chairman of the FCA Frank Naylor, like Foley, has expressed caution about rushing to a bail-out, prefering towait a few months and keep pressure on the system to reformitself, farm credit sources said.    "He (Foley) is willing to give Mr. Naylor some time in thisregard," Moos said.    Moos predicted Congress will begin serious action on arescue package sometime this summer. Any package of legislationis unlikely to include large federal outlays of money, he said.    "I  don't see a big infusion of federal bucks," said Moos,adding that the more likely outcome will be federal guaranteesof borrower stock and bonds held by investors. Reuter&#3;
