The White House said the federalbudget deficit for fiscal 1988 will total 163 billion dlrs ifCongress and the administration fail to agree on a legislativepackage of deficit reduction measures prior to a Nov. 20deadline.    In a report issued under the requirements of new balancedbudget legislation approved by Congress in September, the WhiteHouse budget office predicted the government would take in 903billion dlrs in revenues and spend 1.066 trillion during fiscal1988, which began Oct. 1.    Under the terms of the new law, the government's failure toagree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 20 would triggeracross-the-board spending cuts of 23 billion dlrs.    The White House report said this would reduce those defensespending programs covered by the legislation by 10.5 pct andwould cut domestic programs by 8.5 pct.    This magnitude of reductions would shear 11.5 billion dlrsfrom defense and 11.5 billion dlrs from domestic programs.    The Congressional budget Office last week estimated the1988 budget deficit at 179.3 billion dlrs. Reuter&#3;
