Carolina Power and Light Co saidits board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, thesecond unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.    The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only aboutone pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in1992.    Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been underreview because of a decision by the North CarolinaEnvironmental Management Commission that would have requiredthe unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removingscrubbers.    Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operationsince 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbersthrough the use of low-sulphur coal, and "The addition ofscrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginalair quality improvements."    The company said it will be able to purchase lower-costpower from Duke Power Co &lt;DUK> for intermediate and peakingpurposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two withscrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for laterdevelopment of a generating unit.    Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  "Thehigher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, wouldincrease the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two withscrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year."    A company spokesman said the company has already spentabout 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet beenmade of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company doesnot expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said CarolinaPower intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filingsit will make late this year or early next year. Reuter&#3;
