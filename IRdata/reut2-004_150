Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigehas asked the White House to consider blocking the plannedJapanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer andsemiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S.officials said.    The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterdaythat Baldrige has "serious concerns" about the sale of FairchildSemiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronicsfirm.    The officials told Reuters that if the sale went through itcould leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign/ompany for vital high technology equipment used in itsadvanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligencegathering.    In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen thealready strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japanstemming from the huge Japanese surplus.    The White House Economic Policy Council would consider thesale in the coming weeks, they said.    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was notimmediately known but in the past he has opposed the transferof high technology to foreign governments and companies.    Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other U.S.manufacturers are widely used throughout the world, but nonehave been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanesegovernment-run agencies and universities.
