BankAmerica Corp said it placedits 1.9 billion dlrs in medium- and long-term term loans to theBrazilian public and private sectors on non-accrual status asof March 31.    As a result, the bank's net income for the first quarterwill be reduced by about 40 mln dlrs. If Brazil's suspension ofinterest payments remains in effect, earnings for the wholeyear will be reduced by a further 100 mln dlrs.    BankAmerica said, however, that it expects to report aprofit for the first quarter of 1987.    BankAmerica also said that it had placed 180 mln dlrs ofloans to Ecuador on non-accrual, which will reducefirst-quarter earnings by about five mln dlrs.    If no interest payments are received for the rest of theyear from Ecuador, which is recovering from a severeearthquake, 1987 earnings will be cut by a further 10 mln dlrs.    But, "barring substantialy increased instabilities indeveloping countries," BankAmerica said it continues toanticipate an operating profit in 1987.    In the first quarter of 1986 BankAmerica earned a profit of63 mln dlrs but turned in a loss of 518 mln dlrs for the yearas a whole.    BankAmerica also said it completed yesterday the previouslyannounced sale of its discount brokerage subsidiary, CharlesSchwab Corp. The sale was part of a program of asset disposalsundertaken to staunch losses at the nation's second largestbank holding company.    BankAmerica stressed that it expects Brazil will eventuallyreach a debt rescheduling agreement which will provide for thepayment of interest being deferred in 1987.    "Negotiations will be complicated and lengthy, but wecontinue to expect that a rescheduling agreement will becompleted this year," said A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's chairmanand chief executive officer.    "For the interim period, however, we concluded that theresponsible procedure would be to record income only as wereceive payments on the loans," he added in a statement.    U.S. banks are not legally required to place loans onnon-accrual until interest becomes more than 90 days overdue.    By striking accrued, but unpaid, interest from theiraccounts earlier than necessary, the banks are signalling toBrazil their readiness to dig in for a long fight over theterms of the rescheduling agreement regardless of theshort-term earnings impact, banking analysts said.    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofits 109 billion dlr foreign debt in February, citing a drop inofficial reserves, and said interest payments would be held ondeposit at the central bank pending a rescheduling.    It also froze some 16 billion dlrs of short term creditlines which banks were committed to provide until March 31. Reuter&#3;
