Britain has decided to resist U.S.pressure and retain powers to withdraw tax credits from U.S.parent companies based in states which impose unitary taxes onthe worldwide profits of foreign-owned firms, TreasuryFinancial Secretary Norman Lamont told Parliament.    But he added that the eventual use of those powers wouldnot be backdated if activated before the end of 1988.    The U.K. Government has consistently opposed the use ofunitary taxation of international business on grounds they arecontrary to internationally accepted principles, laid down bythe United Nations and the OECD, Treasury sources said.    In a written parliamentary answer, Lamont said "in themeantime, progress towards a final resolution of the unitarytax issues will be kept under careful review" by Britain.    "Should it be necessary to take action ... Before December31, 1988, it will not apply to dividends paid before the dateof the announcement of such action. If it is necessary to takeaction thereafter, it will not apply to dividends on or beforeDecember 31, 1988," Lamont said.    The Reagan Administratian published draft legislation latein 1985 to limit states use of unitary taxation to the profitsmade inside the U.S., Known as the "water's edge" method.    In response to that draft legislation, Britain agreed todefer initiating action under its Finance Act 1985 - but onlyon the understanding that legislation to resolve the unitarytax issue would be made law and take effect from end-December1986.    Then the U.S. Administration said in September 1986 that ithad decided not to pursue Federal legislation, in view of thepassing of legislation in California.    Britain, however, considers the California legislationunsatisfactory, not least because U.K. Business will have topay a fee for the right of not being assessed by the unitarytax method, government sources said.
