Senate Banking Committee chairmanWilliam Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporatetakeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.    "At the very least, it is high time that we require all riskarbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically  with theSecurities and Exchange Commission and that we considerprecluding brokerage firms and their employers from investingin, or owning any securities issued by, third party riskarbitrage operations," Proxmire said at the start of a hearingon corporate takeovers.    "A burning issue must be whether there ought to be acomplete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage andinvestment banking," Proxmire said.    He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attemptswere hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executiveswho tesitified at the hearing. "I believe that takeovers havebecome so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financialbuccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairmanDavid Roderick said. "For Congress to allow the takeover game tocontinue unchecked, would be economic suicide," ChampionInternational Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added. Reuter&#3;
