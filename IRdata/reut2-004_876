Standard and Poor's Corp said itexpects the asset-backed securities market to grow dramaticallyover the next few years, spurred by what it termed thecompelling benefits of secured financing.    S and P projected the market would grow to 100 billion dlrsin the next five years. Investment bankers say the marketcurrently stands at roughly 11.9 billion dlrs.    Assets used to secure the debt included auto loans, creditcars, computer leases and corporate loans, S and P noted. Themost active issuers to date had two main motivations, lowercosts of funding and increased financial flexibility.    Standard and Poor's pointed out that General Motors Corp&lt;GM>, Chrysler Corp &lt;C> and Nissan Motor Co Ltd &lt;NSAN> realizedfunding advantages by issuing car loan backed debt. But moreimportant, these issuers were able to increase loan volume, andhence car sales, without substantially increasing financialleverage, the rating agency said.    S and P noted that Bank of America, a unit of BankAmericaCorp &lt;BAC>, and RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT> RepublicBank Delawareunit issued credit card backed debt and also realized lowerfunding costs while mitigating increased funding and liquidityrisks resulting from weak financial performance.
