Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowanceto 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way tospur domestic production.    The White House has said it would consider the optionalthough it was generally opposed to any revisions in the newtax code.    Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and GasAssociation that the higher depletion allowance on new oil andenhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs ayear.    The option was one of many contained in a report on oil andthe national security the Energy Department sent to the WhiteHouse on Tuesday.    Herrington said of the increased depletion allowanceoption: "that is one that could significantly increaseproduction at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."
