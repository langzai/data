Contel Corp said its expects toreport second quarter earnings that are lower than last year's74 cts a share and 1987 earnings from continuing operationsthat are about 15 pct lower than last year's 3.04 dlrs pershare.    Donald Weber, president and chief executive officer ofContel, said that lower than expected revenues, higher thananticipated costs to complete certain contracts and one-timeexpenses are behind the lower earnings projections.    As such, Weber said Contel has begun to evaluatestrategies, budgets and operating direction in each of thecompany's divisions "with renewed emphasis on maximizingshareholder value."    Weber added that Contel is holding discussions with&lt;Comsat> on an agreement to terminate the previosuly proposedmerger between the two companies.    Weber added that the results of the evaluations of certainparts of the company may be reflected later this year in acombination of one-time gains or losses not in the anticipatedlower earnings.    Webber said, however, that he was encouraged by thecontinued strength of Contel's telephone businesses and thestrong showing from certain of the company's non-regulatedsectors.    But, he added, that results for other parts of the companywill still be unsatisfactory. Reuter&#3;
