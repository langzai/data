The Secretary-General of the AfricanDevelopment Bank expressed confidence in the institution'sability to handle potential problems with repayment ofdevelopment financing loans.    Koffi Dei-Anang told a news conference at the bank'sheadquarters that loan arrears were only 80 mln dlrs atpresent, a small percentage of total ADB lending which exceededone billion dlrs in 1986.    Some commercial banks have recently taken extraordinarymeasures to deal with third world lending strategies.    "We do have difficulty with repayment of loans on time,"Dei-Anang said. But he denied than any ADB loan arrears weremore than 12 months behind schedule.    "We have never had a default. We have never written off aloan," he added.    Dei-Anang said the Abidjan-based ADB will hold its annualgeneral meeting in Cairo from June 9 to June 11 and over 1,000delegates were expected to attend.    The agenda will include the approval of the bank's annualreport and accounts, but there will be no debate on the capitalincrease which is currently being voted on by the ADBgovernors.    An ADB spokeswoman said the U.S. Had voted for a 200 pctincrease in the bank's capital, but other votes were stillcoming in.    In December, an ad-hoc committee of the ADB's board ofgovernors, comprising 18 African and non-African countries,agreed that a 200 pct increase was necessary to finance a risein lending between 1987 and 1991.    If the recommendations are approved by the board, thecapital of the bank would rise from around 6.55 billion dlrs to19.66 billion dlrs.    Dei-Anang said the capital increase would help the bankimprove its borrowing capacity. "The capital increase is ineffect a passport to the capital market," he said.    "It will enable us to borrow something like 4.5 billion dlrsin the next five years," he added. REUTER&#3;
