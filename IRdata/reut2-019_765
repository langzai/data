Ecuador will produce crude oil in excessof its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of thisyear, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a newsconference.    Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.    "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off thecrude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria andKuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable toproduce during the past few months," he said.    Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadoreanproduction from March to May this year.    Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPECmembers during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increasein Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.    "They understood our position and we believe we remainwithin the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said.    Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean productionwas 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.    While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria andKuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and fourmln barrels of products, Santos said. Reuter&#3;
