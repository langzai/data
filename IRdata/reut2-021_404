Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T> and VolkswagenAG &lt;VOWG.F> are considering raising the local procurement rateat their West German joint venture to at least 60 pct from anearlier planned 50 pct after one year's output, a Toyotaspokesman said.    The two carmakers agreed last June to start jointlyproducing a Toyota-designed light truck at VW's Hanover plantfrom early 1989 at a rate of 7,000 to 8,000 the first year,rising to 15,000 from 1990.    They may equip the light truck with a Volkswagen-madeengine to reach a local procurement rate of 60 pct, he said.    The two companies need to raise the value of locallyprocured parts to 60 pct to avoid tariffs when they export toother European markets, industry sources said. REUTER&#3;
