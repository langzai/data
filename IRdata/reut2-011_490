venezuela will shortly announce a newplan to allow private companies to repay their foreign debtswith equity and for public debt to be converted into privatesector investments, cntral bank president hernan anzola said.    Anzola told a meeting of the banking association yesterdaythe new plan, to be called exchange agreement no. 4, will beannounced in mid-april.    He said it will allow foreign creditors to convert unpaidprivate sector debts into bolivar-denominated shares of stockin the debtor companies. the plan would be similar to thosealready in effect in other latin american nations, he said.    at least a half dozen such debt-equity swaps have alreadytaken place in venezuela. In 1984, a group of 17 U.S. Banks ledby citibank converted 18.3 mln dlrs of debt from the cerveceranacional, into 30 pct of the beer company'stock.    Anzola said exchange agreement no. 4 will also allow forconversion of public sector debt into investments in venezuelanprivate industry.    Holders of venezuelan public debt bonds would be able toexchange them for bolivar-denominated bonds at up to 100 pct oftheir nominal value, which could be turned into privateinvestment in priority areas.    This, anzola said, would mean a reduction in the amount ofthe public sector debt and an increase in foreign investment.He stressed that the public sector debt bonds will not beexchanged for shares of stock in state-owned companies.    Anzola said exchange rates for these transactions willdepend the type of investment the creditor intends to make,with export-oriented companies to be favored.    Venezuela issued a new plan in december for the repaymentof 7.8 billion dlrs in private sector foreign debt. Under thescheme, debtors are able to buy dollars at the preferential7.50 bolivars rate, but must also pay a premium. Reuter&#3;
