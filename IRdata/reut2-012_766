Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg saidhe will advise Brazil to take up discussions with itscommercial bank creditors when he is in Washington for theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting next week.    He told a news conference ahead of the IMF talks thatdiscussions about developing country debt problems would playan important role on the agenda in Washington.    Stoltenberg noted that Brazil had agreed in January to worktogether with the banks but said this pledge had not yet beenfulfilled.    After Brazil imposed a moratorium on interest payments on68 billion dlrs worth of debt in February, Brazilian FinanceMinister Dilson Funaro sought to involve foreign governments inrescheduling talks with banks.    But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonrebuffed Funaro's bid and said commercial bank loans were amatter for banks and not governments. West German bankers alsosaid then that Brazil should seek an understanding with theIMF.    Stoltenberg said in Bonn today that he had already toldFunaro that the unilateral moratorium was a mistake.    Stoltenberg said that despite progress in some areas, thedebt problems of a whole range of countries had recently becomemore difficult.    He said flows from commercial banks had decreased markedlyand that the refusal of some highly indebted countries tofulfil their commitments to private creditors or with the IMFwas one reason for this.    He also said that when debtor countries came up with good,confidence-inspiring policies, commercial banks should reactwith more flexibility in interest structures, maturities andrescheduling.    Many debtor countries had realised that it was not possibleto mobilise capital flows, and especially direct investments,without such policies, Stoltenberg said. REUTER&#3;
