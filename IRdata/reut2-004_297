Union Pacific Corp said it will sign apact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin PetroleumCo subsidiary.    The sale will also include the related marketing anddistribution system for the refinery's products.    A spokesman for the company said that a statement may beissued later today giving details of the transaction.    There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in NewYork.    The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is alargely upgraded facility but he would place no value on thetransaction.    The additional acquisition of refinery and distributionassets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been movingaggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry fromproducer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.    Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits aprofile which PDVSA officials have said previously they lookedfor in any acquisition.    One PDVSA official said the company was looking forindependent oil companies with good refinery and distributionnetwork and a strong regional presence.    The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followedits earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's&lt;SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.    In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paidSouthland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.    The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's CorpusChristi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet forits crude oil production while giving the refiner an assuredsource of supply, trade sources said.    In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to tosupply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and otherfeedstocks. Reuter&#3;
