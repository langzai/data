The European Community (EC) cerealstrade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC FarmCommissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for salesinto intervention, which it claims could save the EC budgetmoney.    It proposes that applications for intervention be madethrough a certificate valid for execution three months later.If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere,he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pctpremium.    Coceral argues that this would restore the originalfunction of intervention as a safety net and would end thepresent situation in which produce is often sold intointervention as a precaution.
