Officials said the Agency was still studying the project,but agency sources said the assessment was in the final stages.    The officials said the agency had received a briefing on adevelopment proposal from General Dynamics to modify its F-16jet. The firm's team arrived here on March 30. They declined toelaborate on the briefing.    A team from McDonnell is arriving next Monday with asimilar proposal based on its F/A-18 Hornet, the Agency said.    A Pentagon team of about 10 experts will follow up with aone-week visit starting on April 11 to discuss the projectedplane with the Agency, the officials said.      Five major Japanese makers will also present briefingsthis month, they said. A spokesman for the group includingMitsubishi Heavy Industries &lt;MITH.T> and Kawasaki HeavyIndustries &lt;KAWH.T> declined to disclose details.
