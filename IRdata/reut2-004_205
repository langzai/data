The EC Commission said it wasadopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of productionquotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steelproducts which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods.    In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that theindustry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacityby 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.    The industry has argued for the maintenance of existingquotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almostall steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market. Reuter&#3;
