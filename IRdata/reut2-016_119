Prime Ministers Zhao Ziyang of China andAnibal Cavaco Silva of Portugal signed an agreement to end morethan four centuries of Portuguese rule over the territory ofMacao and return it to Chinese control in 1999.    Macao will become a special administrative region onDecember 20, 1999, retaining a high degree of autonomy exceptin foreign affairs and defence. Its capitalist system is toremain intact for 50 years under an arrangement similar to theone that will return Hong Kong to China from Britain in 1997.    China hopes to win back the Nationalist-ruled island ofTaiwan under the same "one country, two systems" formula.    "The successful settlement of the question of Macao hasproven and will continue to prove that the concept of 'onecountry, two systems' is realistic and therefore definitelyviable," Zhao said.    Macao's population of 300,000 includes more than 40,000Portuguese passport holders.    Peking has said Chinese nationals in this category will beable to use their Portuguese passports after 1999 but will notbe entitled to Portuguese consular protection in Macao orelsewhere in China.
