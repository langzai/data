Hong Kong's Attorney General MichaelThomas said he decided not to prosecute Alan Bond, chairman of&lt;Bond Corp International Ltd> (BCIL), for giving misleadinginformation about the firm because the case was weak.    He told the Legislative Council there had been widespreadmisunderstanding, speculation and unfair distortion of thereasons for the decision.    "Even if there is evidence that tends to prove the necessaryingredients of an offence, a bare prima facie case is,generally speaking, not enough to warrant a prosecution," addedThomas.    The Attorney General's office said last month it will notprosecute Bond for his statements that the net asset value pershare of properties owned by BCIL should be 2.60 H.K. Dlrsinstead of 1.10 dlrs stated in the firm's prospectus.    The decision followed a public apology by Bond that hisremarks were misleading about BCIL, owned 66.2 pct by theAustralia based Bond Corp (Holdings) Ltd &lt;BONA.S>.    Thomas dismissed a suggestion that he had compromised notto prosecute Bond if an apology was published but added: "itspublication ultimately was a factor I took into account whensubsequently I decided not to prosecute."
