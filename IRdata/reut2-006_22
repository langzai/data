West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl hasinvited the European Community's 17-man Commission for talks inBonn next month in a bid to repair strained relations, ECdiplomats said.    The Commissioners, led by President Jacques Delors, willpay a two-day visit to Bonn on April 1-2 when they were due fora meeting with the principal West German cabinet members.    The meeting, the first of its kind between the Commissionand the government of a member state, was originally meant tofocus on problems posed by West Germany's federal constitution.    But they said the meeting was now likely to be dominated byCommission plans to restructure the EC's exhausted finances andits costly farm policy, which have provoked strong oppositionfrom Bonn.    Kohl has written two letters to Delors, complaining thatthe plans would hit West German farmers hard.  His farmminister Ignaze Kiechle has publicly criticised the two Germanmembers of the Commission for failing to oppose them.    This caused protest from Brussels where the Commissiontries to guard the independence of its members from thegovernments that nominate them. REUTER&#3;
