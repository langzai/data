President Reagan warned the U.S.Congress in his weekly radio address against passing what hecalled dangerous, protectionist trade legislation that wouldtie his hands in trade negotiations with Japan and othercountries.    Reagan, who will hold talks with Japanese Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone here this week, said he would lift tariffsimposed last week against some Japanese products as soon asTokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors.    U.S. officials gave the same message to former JapaneseForeign Minister Shintaro Abe in talks here last week.    In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said hewould tell Nakasone: "We want to continue to work cooperativelyon trade problems and want very much to lift these traderestrictions as soon as evidence permits.    Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mlndlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of traderetaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called hisstaunch anti-protectionist policies.    "In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal witha particular problem, not begin a trade war," he said. Reuter&#3;
