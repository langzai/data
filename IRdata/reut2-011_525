Ames Department Stores Inc fell 1-7/8to 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surpriseannouncement earlier today by the company that earnings in thefiscal year ended January 31 will decline sharply.    Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in theprevious year.    "We were looking for 1.15 dlrs," said an analyst at a majorWall Street firm who declined to be identified. Ames said mostof the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at itsSecaucus, N.J. distribution center.    "The obvious suspicion is that there has been some kind offraud or theft," said Ralph Shulansky, senior vice president ofAmes. "We do not have hard evidence we are still putting thingstogether."    He said it would take several weeks for the company tocomplete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcementofficials involved at this time.    He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said itwas the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline ingross margin percentage and an increase in the effective taxrate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said. Reuter&#3;
