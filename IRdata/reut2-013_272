Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency (IEA) said.    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by aroundone pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels per day, theIEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report.    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices arehigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may bebelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said. Reuter&#3;
