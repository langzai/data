American lawmakers rallied behindPresident Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets inthe Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congressdebate over limits on his powers to make war.    The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warshipsdestroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulfship traffic and military operations, and also raided a secondIranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack ona Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.    Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicansexpressed support for the attack and praised it as anappropriate "measured response."    But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears thatthe growing confrontation between Tehran and the United Statescould erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan complywith the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout ofAmerican forces from the waterway.    "Those who contend the strike was necessary must realizetheir words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of warwith Iran," said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican. Reuter&#3;
