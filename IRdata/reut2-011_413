West German Economics Minister MartinBangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar byboth official and private institutions in the U.S., Saying calmwas needed on the foreign exchanges.    Speaking at the opening of the 40th Hanover Industry Fair,Bangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities hadleft their mark on exports and investments. He added thatwithout these external difficulties, West Germany's economywould have grown by 3.5 pct last year instead of the 2.5 pctreported.    Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climatein West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was notin a downtrend.    The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he saidmainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden forsmaller and medium sized firms.    Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steelindustry, which he said had to be fought with all legal meanswhen they did not correspond to European Community guidelineson grants.    He added that in light of the declining demand for steelcapacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government wouldnot successfully be able to stand in the way of any change inthis industry.    Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and calledfor more competition, citing as an example the Federal PostOffice.    The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany,especially as far as deciding who is able to providetelecommunications equipment. REUTER&#3;
