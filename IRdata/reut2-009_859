International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromiseproposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumerdelegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegatessaid.    Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with majorproducers and consumers this morning to resolve outstandingdifferences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoathe buffer stock can purchase and price differentials fordifferent varieties.    Delegates were fairly confident the differences could beworked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.    Some consuming member nations, including Britain andBelgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pctnon-member cocoa, delegates have said.    The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower qualitynon-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will mosteffectively support prices because that low quality cocoa iscurrently pressuring the market.    Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make upat most a very small percentage of the buffer. They sayMalaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless itis a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoaMalaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.    As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higherdifferential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recentproposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoabought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.    Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a waythat would not promote buffer stock purchases of the moreexpensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.    Other technical points need to be sorted out, includinglimits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy innearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequenteffect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.
