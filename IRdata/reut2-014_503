Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban onforeign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are stillbeing disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had preventedthe movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.    The pay dispute went before a hearing of the ArbitrationCommission today.    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in theports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the weekof action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council toprotest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.    The shipping sources said the various port unions appear tobe taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start ofeach shift and then to walk off.    Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, withcontainer movements most affected, but has not stoppedaltogether, they said.    They said they could not say how long the disruption willgo on and what effect it will have on shipping movements. REUTER&#3;
