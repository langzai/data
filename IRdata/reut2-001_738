A plan by U.S. semiconductor firms tocooperate in a manufacturing facility to compete with firms inJapan could conflict with anti-monopoly law, the plan's backerssaid.    The Semiconductor Industry Association announced at a newsconference a plan for a consortium to be known as SEMATECH tobuild an advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant.    Asked whether U.S. antitrust regulators might object,Charles Sporck, president of National Semiconductor Corp, said,"That is a possibility."    Sporck said the Defense Department had a strong interest inthe project but he declined to estimate how much would besought from the government or how much funding SEMATECH wouldrequire.    Sporck said the group hopes to have an operational planready by June 1.    Then it will search for a site for the manufacturingfacility and an executive to head up the consortium.    The consortium could be operating by the end of the year,and the facility working in 18 months, he said.    International Business Machines Corp hopes to participatein the effort, Paul Low, an IBM executive, said.    He said the project suppliers of raw materials and othersvital to the semiconductor industry, such as toolmakers, wouldbe invited to participate.    Sporck said no decision was made on what product would beproduced, stressing that the emphasis was on developingtechnology and sharing that with firms which belonged toSEMATECH. Other aspects were still undecided, such as whether aJapanese firm with a facility in the United States would beallowed to participate, he said. Reuter&#3;
