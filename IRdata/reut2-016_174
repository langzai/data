Japan warned the United States it maytake retaliatory measures if the U.S. imposes its planned tradesanctions on April 17, a senior government official said at theweekend.    Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Tradeand Industry Ministry, said in a statement that Japan wouldconsider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pcttariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week.    However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue tradetalks with the United States despite its failure to convinceAmerica to call off the threatened tariffs during two days ofemergency talks which ended in Washington on Friday.    In March President Reagan announced the sanctions inretaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honor a July1986 pact to stop dumping computer microchips in marketsoutside the U.S. and to open its home market to U.S. goods.    Fukukawa said the U.S. had not listened to Japan'sexplanation of its efforts to live up the pact. He saod the U.Shad not given detailed reasons of why it planned tariffs. Reuter&#3;
