Negotiations between miningcompanies and the National Union of Mineworkers are founderingand mines could face a May Day work stoppage, the Chamber ofMines said.    It said the union had called off talks on a specific issue,the introduction of a Labour Day on May 1.    The union refused a request to give advance notification ofthe names of workers who would be working on May 1 rather thantaking the option of a paid holiday, the Chamber said.    It said mining companies wanted advance notice in order toplan their operations.    "The union is adamant only employees who wish to work onLabour Day should notify management," the Chamber said.    "This raises the prospect that the mines will once againface stay-away action on May 1 and that the employees who donot work will once again forfeit pay."    It said the union accepted all the proposals except givingadvance notification for May 1.    It said miners had been offered a full paid holiday on May1 or a premium of six pct of their basic monthly pay forworking that day. REUTER&#3;
