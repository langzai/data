The European Commission should make urgentand concrete proposals to break the deadlock over moves to cutsky-high European airfares, an independent report said.    The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) saidcosts, fares and profits on international services withinEurope are the highest in the world although European airlinesare less efficient and not perceptibly safer than their cheaperU.S. Equivalents.    "The European airlines protect their position through thesecrecy they maintain over the costs and profits of any groupof services," the report said.    The airlines also protect themselves through "the ferocitywith which (they) resist any relaxation of the monopolisticpractices which protect their profits," the report said.    Britain, a strong advocate of deregulation, has been tryingto push measures to introduce greater competition amongEurope's airlines but negotiations foundered at the end of 1986over discount and deep discount fares.    The IEA report said European governments and theCommission, the EC executive authority, had beenextraordinarily lax about the airlines' secretiveness, showing"a lack of concern for the interests of the traveller."
