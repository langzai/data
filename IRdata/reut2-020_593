First RepublicBank Corp, the largest bankholding company in Texas, reported a loss of 6.3 mln dlrs forthe third quarter and said that its non-performing loans rosesharply because of a further deterioration in Texas's realestate market.    There was no comparable figure for the third quarter of1986 because the company was formed in June 1987 through themerger of RepublicBank Corp and Interfirst Corp.    Non-performing loans were 3.1 billion dlrs at the end ofSeptember, or 12.4 pct of total assets, mpared with 9.5 pctat the end of the second quarter.    Loans secured by real estate accounted for about 90 pct ofthe 706 mln dlr increase in non-performing loans in the thirdquarter, First Republicbank said.    It said the poor shape of the office and retail housingmarkets in Dallas, Houston and Austin will continue to holdback earnings.    "As indicated earlier in 1987 by First RepublicBank, thecompany will continue to assess future common stock dividendpayments relative to earnings performance," GeraldFronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officier, said in astatement.    First RepublicBank said its third-quarter loan lossprovision of 106 mln dlrs and net charge-offs of 87 mln dlrsleft its total allowance for credit losses at 1.14 billiondlrs, or 4.6 pct of the loan portfolio.    The company's primary capital amounted to 7.9 pct of assetsat the end of September.    The 6.3 mln dlr loss was sustained despite a 29 mln dlr cutin overhead, achieved partly by staff attrition. The size ofthe combined staffs of the two banks has been cut by 12 pct sofar this year, and Fronterhouse said the bank is ahead of theschedule it set for achieving savings through the merger.
