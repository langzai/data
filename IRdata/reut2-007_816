There are heightened fears that "ElNino" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continentsand caused widespread damage through floods and drought, theU.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a fieldreport.    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led toincreased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.    However, it said official sources still believe that thisyear's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds andwaters in the pacific.    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now beingexperienced has not had an overall negative impact onagricultural production.    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduceyields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in thecrop cycle.    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive whereexcessive moisture exists, it said.    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supplyof irrigation water in the major dams which will improveprospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, andslow the decline in sugar production, it said.    If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry couldreceive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fishcatch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are threeto four degrees centigrade above normal but still not highenough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino willintensify and carry on through late March, April and Maycausing problems as crops approach harvest.    "There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino-- only time will tell," the report said. Reuter&#3;
