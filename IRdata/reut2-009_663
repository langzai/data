Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in astatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite afall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar andother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressureon selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices ofcrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale ofpolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01billion from 42.72 billion.    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billionmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by thecold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continuesat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below theprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from1986, Hoechst said.    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and informationtechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance ofthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and to&lt;American Hoechst Corp>.    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected therestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.    Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidatedpartners did not perform as well as in 1985.    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretaxprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earningsfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall inextraordinary costs.    The fall in raw material prices was not enough tocompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices andcurrencies, Hoechst said.    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in newprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capitalincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with theacquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>.
