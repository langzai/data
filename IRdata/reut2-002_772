Standard and Poor's Corp said it cut toB from B-plus 900 mln dlrs of notes due 1994 of Holiday InnsInc, a unit of Holiday Corp.    S and P said the action reflected a change in the issue'sterms to unsecured from secured. That change was made after Sand P's initial rating release on February 20, it noted.    After the firm's recapitalization, substantially all of itsassets will be pledged to secure bank and other debt totaling1.4 billion dlrs. S and P said it is making a ratingdistinction between secured and unsecured debt because of thesignificant amount of secured in Holiday's capital structure.    However, S and P said that if the amount of secured debtdecreases meaningfully, then the secured and unsecured debtcould be rated equally.    The 900 mln dlrs of seven-year notes were priced lateyesterday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The noteswere given a 10-1/2 pct coupon and par pricing.    Holiday Inns also sold yesterday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs ofsubordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and parpricing. This issue was rated B-minus by S and P.    Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc said its initialrating of B-1 for the notes remained appropriate. Reuter&#3;
