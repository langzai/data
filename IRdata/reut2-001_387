President Reagan, seeking to salvagehis Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal, said amajor U.S. economic program for the region was working butneeded 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned.    In a report to Congress, he called for immediate approvalof 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four CentralAmerican democracies and eventual full-funding of a totaleconomic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992.    The report, mandated by Congress, explains how theadministration intends to carry out the recommendations of theReagan-appointed Kissinger Commission, which in 1984 developeda blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant tooffset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels.    The commission, headed by former Secretary of State HenryKissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989.    "The Soviet Union and its allies have provided theSandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aidto keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat," Reagan said.    Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who briefedreporters, said the administration will not try to linkapproval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, withthe vastly more popular economic package for the region, assome Republican leaders in Congress have suggested.    He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contrascandal, Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlrallotment in military aid for the rebels, who are fightingManagua's leftist Sandinista government.    Abrams admitted the administration would have its toughestfight in the Democratic-controlled House, but said he believeda majority of the Senate -- led by Democrats for the first timein six years -- would back the military request.
