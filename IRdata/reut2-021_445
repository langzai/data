Iranian President Ali Khamenei said hedoubted the U.S. Was in position to take violent action againstIran in the Gulf, Tehran Radio reported.    The U.S. Government "is in a very difficult situation nowand it is not clear if it has the necessary elements for aviolent action," the radio quoted him as saying in an interviewwith the English language daily Tehran Times.    In Washington, President Ronald Reagan said he had decidedon a response to Iran, which the Americans blame for twomissile attacks on U.S.-related tankers in Kuwaiti waters lastweek, but declined to say what the response was.    Khamenei said the U.S. Government had to take some actionto demonstrate its authority, "but on the other hand any violentact in the Persian Gulf will greatly harm long-term U.S.Interests," the radio, monitored in Nicosia, reported.    On efforts for a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war, Khameneisaid: "Declaration of the aggressor and a ceasefire should beconcurrent. Formation of a panel to determine the aggressornecessarily preceeds the ceasefire."    He also rejected a peace-keeping committee or a bufferforce as instruments to implement a July 20 U.N. SecurityCouncil order for a ceasefire in the seven-year-old Gulf war. REUTER&#3;
