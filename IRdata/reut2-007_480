The Chinese port of Ningbo isworking well below capacity despite being only 130 miles fromShanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said.    Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China --handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mlnin 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mlntonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986.    Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of itsinadequate facilities, including a single track rail linelinking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network.    Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coalfrom north to south China and imports include fertiliser andsoda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks canhandle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour.    Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since1979, official publications show. A container berth and twotimber and three general cargo berths will be added during thecurrent 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said.    "The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995.By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai," he added. REUTER&#3;
