The Federal Aviation Administrationsaid it ordered U.S. airlines to inspect their older DC10 jumbojets within five days for hairline cracks in tail areas.    The FAA action follows a warning to the airlines by theplane's maker, Douglas Aircraft Co, that three cracks had beendiscovered on two DC10s.    Douglas Aircraft is a unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp.    Such cracks typically are caused by metal fatigue and poseno safety risk if repaired.    The cracks were found in the metal skin covering the tail,during aircraft maintenance.    If not detected and repaired, the cracks "may progress untilthe spar cap or skin panel is severed, which could result instructural failure," the FAA order said.    The spar cap is the top part of the tail wings' main beam.    The FAA said the inspection order would apply to airplaneswith over 40,000 hours of flight or more than 12,000 landings. Reuter&#3;
