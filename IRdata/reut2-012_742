West Germany's chemicalindustry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, JosefStrenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.    Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>,told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the maindangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar aswell as crude oil and commodity prices.    Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harmingearnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at thestart of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.    The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, wasbadly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover wasmainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.    Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 andcompetition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings fromlower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by pricecompetition and increased costs.    Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemicalfirms were slightly worse than the year before but the improvedfinancial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,neutralized the negative impact.    Strenger said the industry would try to increase productionin the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out ofWest Germany.    The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall inexports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.    Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far Eastexports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.    Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidencefollowing several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine latelast year. REUTER&#3;
