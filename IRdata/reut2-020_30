Thai stock prices plunged on Tuesday asnervous investors unloaded shares on reports of steep declineson major world stock markets.    Brokers said the Securities Exchange of Thailand Index fella record 36.64 points, or nearly eight pct, to close at 422.37.    "It's impossible to halt the slide in this situation. Themarket just doesn't behave logically," said SirivatVoravetvuthikun, executive vice president of Asian SecuritiesTrading Co Ltd.    But Sirivat said he did not believe the fall would mark theend of the SET's 16 month bull run, which has acceleratedduring the last two months. He expected Thai stocks tofluctuate widely in the next few weeks.    The slide on Tuesday followed a 13.85 point decline of the97-stock index on Monday when it closed at 459.01.    Brokers said they were flooded with sell orders when themarket opened this morning and a SET announcement urginginvestors not to panic was ignored.    The index reached a record 472.86 last Friday, up 57.7 pctfrom end-June and 128.2 pct higher than last December.    SET officials said 77 issues were traded on Tuesday, ofwhich all but two declined. Of the losers, 68 plummeted thedaily maximum 10 pct allowed by the exchange. Prices on thespecial foreign column also fell sharply.    SET vice president Suthichai Chitvanich told reporters the10 pct floor serves as a restraint, making it unnecessary tosuspend trading should the panic continue.    The Thai exchange has lately been gaining on its ownstrength with most buying coming from local investors.    Investors should not be unduly influenced by foreign marketreports, he added.    Suthichai said sound local fundamentals, including lowinterest rates and promising economic growth, favouredinvestment in the stock market.    The SET also announced it would release third quartercorporate earnings earlier than expected as part of efforts toshore up public confidence. REUTER&#3;
