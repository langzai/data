Telex Corp said its board adopted ashareholder rights plan which will allow shareholders topurchase one common share for two dlrs if a hostile groupacquires 15 pct or more of the company.    However, the company said the plan will not be triggered bypurchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offercommenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a groupcontrolled by New York financier Asher Edelman.    It said the rights will be distributed on a one for onebasis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemedbefore they become exercisable at five cents per right.    The company said the rights will expire on the later ofFebruary 17 next year or 60 days from the date they becomeexercisable.

The rights become exercisable if any person or groupacquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock otherthan through an all cash tender offer for all outstandingshares at 65 dlrs per share.
