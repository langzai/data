"We have placed top priority on the restoration ofshareholders' equity in the shortest time frame possible," saidJohn McGillicuddy, chairman and chief executive.    "The first step was selling the full amount of new commonequity we anticipate needing in this replenishment process,"McGillicuddy added. "The remainder will come from higher coreearnings, the sale of undervalued, non-strategic assets and therecognition of tax benefits."    Taken together, he said, these moves, as well as tightercontrol over asset levels, will raise the corporation's commonequity-to-assets ratio to the four-pct range by the end of1988.
