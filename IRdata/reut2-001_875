Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit anew high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, comparedwith 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a yearearlier, the central bank said.    Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increasecame mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billionU.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 andMarch 4.    He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, becauseTaiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its tradesurplus to decline over the next few months as a result.    Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billionU.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.    In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pcton some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surpluswith the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2billion, according to official statistics.    Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for EconomicPlanning and Development, told Reuters the government isplanning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second halfof this year.    The reserves could support imports of more than two yearsfor Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and theU.S. REUTER&#3;
