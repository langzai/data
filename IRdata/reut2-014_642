Bankers Trust New York Corp said it hasplaced its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-termloans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarternet income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrsof medium- and long-term debt on February 22.    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stopaccruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "the highpotential of a continued suspension that would result inreaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates arereceived for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated thatfull-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiationsbetween Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to theresumption of interest payments.    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when centralbank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt thatmatures on April 15.
