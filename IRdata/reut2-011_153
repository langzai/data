Japan has decided to cooperate with theU.S. To develop a new generation of fighter planes, DefenceMinister Yuko Kurihara said.    Japan is now in a major trade dispute with Washington, butKurihara told reporters the decision was not made in responseto outside pressure and described the project as a Japanese-ledprogram with U.S. Cooperation.    President Ronald Reagan said last week that the U.S. Wouldimpose high tariffs on Japanese imports to retaliate againstalleged Japanese violation of a computer chip trade pact.    The plane, codenamed the FSX, has been the focus ofcompetition between Japanese and U.S. Defence contractors. Atstake is an estimated 6.5 billion dlrs worth of contracts whichthe Japanese government had previously intended to award todomestic firms.    The Ministry has said the plane, part of Japan's selfdefence forces, will be equipped with high technology radardodging equipment, and will be able to fly at very lowaltitudes. It will have a combat radius of 830 kms.    The ministry plans to build 100 FSX fighters to replace all77 of Japan's Mitsubishi-made F-1 planes by the 1990s.    A defence ministry spokesman said the timing of theannouncement had nothing to do with escalating trade frictionbetween Japan and the U.S., Its largest trading partner.    "This is an objective decision, made after discussions withU.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger," he said.    However, with two weeks to go before the U.S. Imposestariffs, Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, toldForeign Minister Tadashi Kuranari that Japan must addressindividual market-opening issues, such as the FSX, defenceministry officials said.
