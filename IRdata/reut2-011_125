Brazilian President Jose Sarneyannounced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase ofU.S. Dollar currency in the parallel market, aimed at promotingimports of foreign goods.    In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for thepurchase of goods."    The parallel market, although tolerated, is technicallyillegal. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel marketis being sold at 25 to 100 pct above the official rate.    Sarney's decision means that Brazilian importers ofmachinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency inthe parallel market without having to wait for the issuing ofan official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign TradeDepartment (Cacex).    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in aneffort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviatethe risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of theeconomy.    The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council(CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil'strade policy, with participation of the private sector.    The Council had been closed three years ago by the militarygovernment of former President Joao Figueiredo.    Tomorrow, Brazil was due to fulfill payment of 15 billiondollars in short range credit lines, but its economic officialshave suggested a 60-day extension in the deadline in order toseek a renegotiation with its creditors.    Sarney told members of the Council that for Brazil it is amust to recover its annual trade balance surplus to the 12billion dollars average recorded in 1984 and 1985, and whichdropped sharply last year to 8 billion dollars.    He attributed the poor performance of Brazil's tradebalance in 1986 to protectionist moves by industrialisedcountries, the fall in the prices of basic goods and the crisisfaced by several of Brazil's Third World trade partners.
