The European &lt;Airbus Industrie> consortiumtoday formally signed an agreement with the Franco-U.S. Group&lt;CFM International> for an improved version of the CFM56-5engine to power the A340-200 and A340-300 aircraft, an Airbusstatement said.    Airbus said yesterday that it chosen the CFM56-5-S3 engine,to be produced by &lt;General Electric> of the U.S. And &lt;SNECMA ofFrance, because the &lt;International Aero Engine> (IAE) hightechnology superfan engine would not be ready by early 1992,when the A340 plane is due to become operational.    The five-nation IAE consortium has decided not to go aheadwith the proposed launch of the superfan, a spokesman forconsortium member &lt;Rolls-Royce Plc> said today, adding that theproject had not been cancelled and could be offered later on.    Airbus said the CFM56-5-S3 will have a thrust of 30,600 lbsand an improved fuel burn of four per cent compared with theCFM56-5A1 which is now being operated on the A320 flight-testaircraft. It will be available for deliveries of the A340 inMay 1992.    At the same time, the Airbus statement said AirbusIndustrie and General Electric have concluded an accord for animproved version of the GE CF6-80C2 engine, with 64,000 lbs ofthrust and a three per cent improvement in specific fuelconsumption, to power the A330 aircraft which will beintroduced in spring 1993.    "This continues the long-standing history of all Airbuslaunches being made with either GE or CFMI engines," AirbusIndustrie president Jean Pierson said in the statement.    "Airbus Industrie has already worked with CFMI to launch onenew aircraft programme - the A320 - in early 1984, and is happyto build on this relationship by launching the A340 with animproved version of the same engine," Pierson said.    Airbus Industrie said it has so far received a total of 128commitments for the A340 and A330 from nine customers. Reuter&#3;
