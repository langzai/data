Hydro-Quebec, the provincially-ownedutility, said it is appearing this week before the NationalEnergy Board to defend its application to export about fivebillion Canadian dlrs worth of electricity to the New Englandstates.    The contract with the New England Power Pool was signed in1985 and runs from 1990 to 1999. A spokesman for the Quebecutility said hearings are normally held on major contracts upto two years after the deal is signed.    Hydro-Quebec, which last month agreed to sell 15 billiondlrs worth of power to Maine starting in 1992, has to convincethe board the electricity is surplus to Canadian needs.    Utilities in at least three Canadian provinces have saidthey are opposing the New England deal. The Ontario and NewBrunswick utilities said they are objecting becauseHydro-Quebec did not offer them the electricity before going tothe New England Power Pool. New Brunswick said it is alsoconcerned that Hydro-Quebec is taking all the U.S. exportmarkets.    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said severalprovinces, including Newfoundland which wants to renogotiate apower agreement with Quebec, routinely oppose the Quebecutility's export contracts.    Hebert said the National Energy Board has ordered changesto contracts in the past but has always left the agreementsessentially intact.    He said the utility was not prepared to comment on whetherit believed the board would call for substantial changes to theagreement with New England.    He said the hearings, which began today, will probably lasttwo or three days and a decision made in about two weeks.    Hydro-Quebec has recently been trying to move from exportcontracts for surplus energy to contracts for guaranteedamounts of energy, such as the deal signed with Maine. Reuter&#3;
