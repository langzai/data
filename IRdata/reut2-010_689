"Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations byexplaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points thatneed to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service assaying.    While expressing regret over America's decision to imposetariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone saidTokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washingtonto help settle the dispute.    Government officials said Japan would make a formal requestnext week for emergency talks and that the two sides wouldprobably meet the week after, just days before the April 17deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japaninvestigation of American claims that Japanese companies aredumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.    On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronicgoods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure tolive up to their bilateral chip pact.
