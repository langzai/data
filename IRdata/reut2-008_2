The U.S. Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal todrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growersfor the cut with targeted income payments.    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanyingthe "Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987", Peter Myers,Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administrationwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginningwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by thegovernment for the price support cut with targeted incomepayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments wouldcost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.    The administration sugar proposal is expected to beintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.John Porter, R-Ill.    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic itis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate becausepolitically-influential sugar and corn growersand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and graduallylowers payments over four years. It also excludes from paymentany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a growerwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.    The income payments would be based on the amount ofcommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changesin the sugar program because the current high price support iscausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.    He said the current program has artificially stimulateddomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowedcorn sweeteners to make market inroads.    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a"progressive contraction" of the sugar import quota to only onemln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugarrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program givesoverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products acompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports ofsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processingfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost onU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA saidconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more thannecessary for sugar.    "Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap betweensweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverseimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currentlyfacing," Myers said.    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts perlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tonsrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal tocompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.
