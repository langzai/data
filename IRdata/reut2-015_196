International Business MachinesCorp said IBM vice president Ray S. AbuZayyad has been namedpresident of its ROLM Corp subsidiary, succeeding Dennis D.Paboojian, who remains with IBM as a consultant.    The company said IBM vice president Paul R. Low has beennamed president of the IBM General Products Division,succeeding AbuZayyad, and IBM vice president Michael J. Attardohas been named president of IBM's General Technology Division,succeeding Low.    A Rolm spokeswoman said Paboojian decided to step down forpersonal reasons.    His decision, she said, was not related to IBM's move lastmonth to merge Rolm's sales and service organization into itsown marketing corps.    That merger was viewed by some analysts as reducing Rolm'sindependence and relegating it to a role as a manufacturing andproduct development site within IBM.    "He wanted to take some personal time off," she said,adding that Paboojian had taken part in the merger decision.    Scores of Rolm veterans have left the company, which makestelephone exchanges and other communications equipment, sinceit was acquired by IBM in 1984.    Rolm's highly respected founder, Ken Oshman, left more thana year ago.    Rolm and IBM customers have complained about a lack ofcoordination between Rolm and IBM, and analysts estimate theunit lost money last year.    But the spokeswoman said Paboojian was "happy with the waythings are going with Rolm." She said the unit posted its bestfourth quarter revenues ever in the 1986 fourth quarter. Reuter&#3;
