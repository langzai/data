Sweden's Nordbanken banking groupsaid it would postpone indefinitely its planned auction onMonday of 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral byFermenta's &lt;FRMS ST> founder and former chief executive Reefatel-Sayed.    A statement cited Fermenta's financial position as the mainreason for delay. The company's 1986 deficit had earlier beenestimated at 136 mln crowns, but that was revised at anextraordinary shareholders meeting last Monday to half abillion crowns. The company said at the meeting a planned newshare issue would not be launched but that another, estimatedto raise 580 mln crowns, was scheduled for April.    Nordbanken said the auction was the natural result of adebtor's inability to repay an overdue loan. Although itexpected to buy the shares back itself, it did not excludeaccepting a suitable bid for them.    Nordbanken loaned 200 mln crowns to Reefat el-Sayedprivately and is Fermenta's largest creditor with loans of l55mln crowns.    It was one of the four Swedish banks which last monthagreed to advance Fermenta 110 mln crowns to solve itsimmediate liquidity problems. REUTER&#3;
