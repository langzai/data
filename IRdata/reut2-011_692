The grain output of a major Chinesegrain-producing province is not increasing, because farmerslack incentives, production costs are rising, storagefacilities are poor and there is not enough state investment ingrain, the province's vice-governor said.    The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton asthey could growing grain, and three times as much growing cashcrops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pctof farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investmenthad caused the area of irrigated land to fall.    Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pctof the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.    He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain washit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and afurther 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.    He said government measures to deal with the problem dealtwith trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for moreinvestment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal useof or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called thetendency to rely on grain imports.    The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate tothe National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He saidthe government had cut agricultural investment to three to fourpct from 11 pct.    "With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past fewyears, some people got carried away, relaxing their attentionto grain and cotton production," he said.    On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to beself-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from thenortheast, but it imports wheat.    "Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reachthe 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be consideredadequate," Tian said. REUTER&#3;
