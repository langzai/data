&lt;Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc> said that,due to poor market conditions for railway freight carmanufacturing, it plans to sell its Trenton Works division inTrenton, Nova Scotia.    Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mlndlrs for the proposed sale.    It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lowerearnings in transportation equipment and losses in steelcastings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sectorand improvements in forestry equipment.    Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipmentwas limited with export sales frequently restrained bycustomers' financing difficulties.    Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railwayscontinued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements atthe lowest level in the past decade.    However, there was demand for industrial casting due toincreased hydro-electric power generation, the company said.    The company said manufacturing of mining machinery andtunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in theU.S. and export markets, mainly China and India.    The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity inaircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture ofengine components.    Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by astrike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U.S.imports of Canadian lumber, but there were encouraging signs atyearend, the company said.
