The United States today handed Sovietarms negotiators a draft treaty which would eliminate allsuperpower medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and slashsuch weapons elsewhere to 100 warheads on each side.    Maynard Glitman, who heads the American team discussingmedium-range nuclear forces, told reporters the document, "afull treaty text," was now on the negotiating table.    The proposal responds to a new Soviet offer to abolish"Euromissiles" and cut sharply medium-range nuclear forceselsewhere announced by Mikhail Gorbachev last Saturday.    The developments have been described by many disarmamentexperts as the first real opening for a superpower accord sincethey resumed arms control talks in March 1985.    Glitman presented the draft treaty during a one and a halfhour meeting at the American diplomatic mission with the Sovietteam on medium-range missiles headed by Lem Masterkov.    He told reporters: "It is a complete document. It has to bebecause we want precision. We don't want any ambiguities."    The draft called for elimination - removal and destruction- of all superpower medium-range missiles in Europe over fiveyears and reduction elsewhere during that period to 100 atomicwarheads on each side, Glitman added.    In Europe, this includes 270 Soviet triple-warhead SS-20'sand 316 single-warhead U.S. Pershing-2 and cruise missiles. Reuter&#3;
