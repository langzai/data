National Broadcasting Co, a unit ofGeneral Electric Co &lt;GE>, said programming has not beenaffected by a strike which began just after midnight June 28.    "Right now things are running very smoothly," said NBCspokeswoman McClaine Ramsey.    The strike by members of the National Association ofBroadcast Employees, representing 2,800 of NBC's 8,000 workers,began after the network imposed a contract which the union saidwas unacceptable. The union said its main objection to thecontract was that it permitted NBC to employ additionalpart-time workers.    Ramsey said managers had been trained to replace the rolesof many of the producers, news writers, editors and technicianswho walked off the job. She said no reductions in programming,much of which is summer re-run schedule, were expected.    NABET executive board member Bill Freeh said many people,some brought in from foreign news bureaus, had crossed picketlines set up at NBC television stations and bureaus. Reuter&#3;
