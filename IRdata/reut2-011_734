Taiwan's shipbreaking industry isexpected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986because of keener competition from South Korea and China, therising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products,industry sources said.    Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt),up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a TaiwanShipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, toldReuters.    China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year whileSouth Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.    Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leadingshipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, "Weexpect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expecteddecline in our steel product exports."    Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline inscrapping operations this year due to falling demand from theU.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.    Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steelproduct exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first halfof 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, aTaiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.    Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steelexports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's.    The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct againstthe U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers andeconomists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar bythe end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.    In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuanremained stable during the same period, he added.    "We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland Chinabecause foreign importers have switched their purchases," hesaid.    Taiwan's steel exports to the U.S., Japan and SoutheastAsia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel andIron Association official said.    He said he expected further declines in later months butdid not give figures. REUTER&#3;
