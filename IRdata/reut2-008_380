Washington Water Power Co said itrequested the Washington Utilities and TransportationCommission to issue an accounting order which would revise thecurrent method of accounting for investment tax credits.    Approval of the order would allow the company to apply taxcredits to earnings in 1987, 1988 and 1989 rather thanspreading those credits over a period of about 30 years underthe current method.    A similar request was filed with the Idaho Public Utilitiescommission in November of 1986 but hearings have been delayeduntil later in 1987. Reuter&#3;
