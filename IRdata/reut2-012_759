Unions are planning a week of state-widestrikes in New South Wales, starting midnight next Tuesday, toprotest against a state move to cut workers' compensation.    NSW Labour Council secretary John MacBean, who is also anexecutive member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions(ACTU), said the council has authorised the strikes and otherindustrial action.    The NSW government has introduced in the state parliament anew Workers' Compensation Act which would cut by up to onethird the cash benefits paid to injured workers.    MacBean said almost every business sector would be hit andthe unions would extend their action for two or three moreweeks if the state government went ahead with its plan. Reuter&#3;
