The West German airline, DeutscheLufthansa AG, believes the way it decides fares is in line withEuropean Community (EC) guidelines despite an official probe, acompany spokesman said today.    The Federal Cartel Office in West Berlin is investigatingwhether agreements reached by European airlines over fares area breach of EC regulations on competition.    Hubertus Schoen, the Cartel Office's spokesman, said theinvestigation had been running for some weeks.    A spokesman for Lufthansa told Reuters: "Lufthansa presumesthat the way we decide fares corresponds with EC regulations."    Airlines did not traditionally have to comply with a clausein the Community's treaty forbidding companies in member statesfrom reaching accords likely to hinder free competition.    However, Schoen said that last year the European Court ofJustice had ruled that this clause should also apply to airtraffic. The Cartel Office"s probe came in the wake of this.    The Office had not yet officially contacted Lufthansa, butSchoen said the airline would be asked for information aboutthe way fares were decided.    It would then be decided if the practice was a breach ofarticle 85 of the EC treaty. Reuter&#3;
