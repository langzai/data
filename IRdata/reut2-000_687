Gelco Corp said that,excluding the effects of a restructuring plan, it expectspre-tax operating earnings for the year to end July 31, 1987,to be about the same as those of last year.    For the year ended July 31, 1986, Gelco reported pre-taxoperating earnings of 14.8 mln dlrs, or 1.08 dlrs a share.    However, final results will be affected by certain chargesincluding legal and investment advisors fees, preferred stockdividends and other costs of restructuring, it said.    Expenses associated with restructuring are expected to beoffset by "significant" gains from the sale of some of Gelco'sbusiness units, it said.    The final outcome for the fiscal year will be determined bythe timing and proceeds from the sale, it added. Reuter&#3;
