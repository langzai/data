Call money rose to 3.70/80 pct from3.50/60 pct in moderate business as liquidity drained from thesystem on pension payments by insurance firms, dealers said.    But the market was relatively liquid for the month's end,when rates usually tighten, dealers said. Call money was stillat or slightly below the 3.80 pct rate set on the most recentBundesbank securities repurchase offer last week.    The insurances would probably draw down some 11 billionmarks for pension payments. But part of this would be offset byan estimated five to six billion marks flowing in from treasurybills bought from the Bundesbank on Thursday, dealers said.     Rates could ease later in the week as bank customersdeposit part of their pension payments back with the bankstomorrow and Wednesday, and banks face reserve requirements fora new month, dealers said.    On Thursday, banks' actual daily reserve holdings fell to43.3 billion marks, down substantially from 49.1 billion onWednesday. But the daily average holdings for the first 25 daysof the month stood at 51.8 billion marks, well above therequired daily average net reserve holdings of 50.7 billion.    The Bundesbank has not scheduled a securities repurchasetender this week, since there is no expiring prior pact. dealers said liquidity was adequate without the addition of newrepo funding.    If tightness does occur the Bundesbank may add short-termtemporary federal government funds to counteract this. The lastsuch liquidity injection was carried out as call money ratesrose above 4.00 pct earlier this month, dealers said. REUTER&#3;
