The nation's exchanges and brokeragehouses said their computers systems have been strained by theavalanche of trading triggered by the past week's stock marketcollapse.    And while the financial instry's hi-tech resources havebeen able to handle the crisis, the sudden surge in tradingvolume will likely force the exchanges and securities firms torevamp their computer systems and communications networksseveral years earlier than they had planned, industry officialssaid.    "We had already started certain processes to increase theNew York Stock Exchange's capacity," said Jim Squyres, aspokesman for the Securities Industry Automation Corp, whichruns the central computer network for the New York and AmericanStock Exchanges.    "We will have to seriously consider speeding that up," hesaid. After three straight days of record volume, however, manyexchanges were pushing their systems to untested limits. Andwhile the exchanges said their computers were handling thecrush, brokers and traders complained about lost trades anddelayed price quotes.    The most serious problems arose on Monday, when a recordfall of 508 points in the dow and volume of more than 600 mlnshares on the New york stock exchange stunned the entireindustry.    The American Stock Exchange's order-routing system crashedjust 10 minutes before trading closed. The Pacific StockExchange suspended business a half-hour early so it could catchup with a massive backlog of trades.    And the price-quote feed supplied by the NYSE was cut offseveral times during the day, leaving some traders with quotesthat were often 45 minutes behind the actual market.     Although the computers whirred away late into the night,the exchanges opened on time Tuesday and problems were fewer,even though NYSE volume swelled to 610 mln shares. Combinedvolume of the NYSE, American and over-the-counter exchangestopped 900 mln shares.    "I think we're equipped for this kind of trading," saidPaul Stevens, executive vice president of operations for theAmerican Stock Exchange.    "The problem is less the computers, which are handling thevolume, than the strain on people," he said.        "The computers might turn out to be the heroes of thiswhole thing," added DuWayne Peterson, executive vice presidentof technology at Merrill Lynch and Co Inc.    In fact, officials said the biggest constraint on tradingwas caused by some of the oldest machines on exchange floors,the card printers that issue the buy and sell orders.    But even as computer executives spoke with awe about theirsystems' ability to hold up under unprecedented pressure, theystarted to plan for the future.     "We had to do a lot of innovative things to handle thisvolume," said Squyres of the Securities Industry AutomationCorp (SIAC), which is jointly owned by the New York andAmerican Stock exchanges.    SIAC had planned to boost the capacity of its system by upto 50 pct by 1990. But that and other improvements will now bemade much earlier.    Meanwhile, New York Telephone Co said Monday's panicselling did not wreak havoc on its telephone system.    "It was a normally heavy business day," said companyspokesman Steve Marcus. Reuter&#3;
