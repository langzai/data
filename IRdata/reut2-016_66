Union and New South Wales governmentofficials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workerscompensation, averting increased industrial action in thestate, union sources said.    But some unions, including those of building and miningworkers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and wouldcontinue their strikes for a few more days.    State officials said the government had agreed to reviseits proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightlyhigher cash benefits for injured workers.    Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes andother industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details ofthe compromise package are not yet known.    The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council ofTrade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Walesunless the government modified its pending legislation on theissue.    State officials said the only sectors affected in the pastthree days were some government building projects, railwayfreight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports. REUTER&#3;
