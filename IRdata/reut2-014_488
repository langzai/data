Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) Vice Minister Makoto Kuroda leaves forWashington today with data he hopes will refute U.S. ChargesJapan has violated a pact on microchip trade.    A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washingtonlaying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S.Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S.Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products.    But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. "I havenothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the currentsituation," Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.    Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect dataand an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control marketforces. "The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilisesupply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excessinventories since 1985 will take some time," he said.    Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip salesin Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.    He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday toforestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter. U.S. Officials said this week'stalks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs. REUTER&#3;
