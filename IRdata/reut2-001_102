Belgian Foreign Trade Minister HermanDe Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within theEuropean Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fatsand oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the UnitedStates.    De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administrationofficials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conferencethere is a battle within the community on the tax on fats andoils used in the 12 EC countries.    But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue becausethere will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there willbe a compromise."    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterdaythat if the community went ahead with the tax, the UnitedStates would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights andaccess to community markets.    De Croo also said he thought the community would postponeits April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules tocover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress wasmade toward resolving differences with the United States.    U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards andthe EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.    He also told reporters he hoped the community could dealwith another controversial health proposal that would forbidthe feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by theUnited States.    De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might beresolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.    He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to changeslaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned afew months later by the hormone rule. Reuter&#3;
