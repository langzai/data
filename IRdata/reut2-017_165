The Soviet government said economicresults achieved in the first three months of the year wereunsatisfactory, the official news agency Tass said.    Soviet industrial production from January to March grew by2.5 per cent compared with the same period last year, but fellshort of its target by 0.8 percent, official statistics showed.    "The Council of Ministers (government) emphasised that theresults did not meet the Communist Party's exacting demands forthe radical reconstruction of the economy," Tass said. "The firstquarter economic results were deemed unsatisfactory."    The government said poor economic results last January,when industrial production was 0.1 lower than in January 1986,had been overcome to a considerable extent in March, but thenegative effects had not been completely eliminated.     It singled out failings in the engineering, chemical andtimber industries, as well as light industry.    Growth in the machine-building sector, a priority inKremlin plans for economic renewal, also fell short of targetby 4.2 per cent, with below-level output in nearly all branchesat a cost of 723 million roubles (1.08 billion dollars) inundelivered products.    The sales volume of consumer goods fell 2.7 per cent shortof planned growth, with a resulting decline in income to thestate, the figures showed.    Foreign trade turnover totalled 27.5 billion roubles (41.25billion dollars), or 4.8 billion roubles (7.2 billion dollars)less than in the same period last year.    The power industry, however, performed well. Output of oil,electricity, gas and coal were all above plan. Reuter&#3;
