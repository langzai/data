International Minerals andChemical Corp said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencygranted permission to its subsidiary, IMCERA Bioproducts Inc,to make a genetically engineered microorganism for use as agrowth factor in laboratories.    The action marks the first time such a biotechnologicalproduct has undergone successful review by the EPA, it said.    The EPA action clears the way for IMCERA to begincommercial production of the microorganism, Escherichia ColiK-12, in the production of its IGF-I growth factor for use inlaboratories in cultivating tissues and cells, it said.    Escherichia Coli K-12 is a non-pathogenic organism commonlyused in laboratory operations for studies and commercialfermentations, and does not affect humans, it said.    International Minerals said it plans to manufacture themicroorganism at IMCERA's plant in Terre-Haute, Indiana andmarket it to research institutions and pharmaceutical companiesin the U.S. and other countries.
