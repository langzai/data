Fiji gold miner &lt;Emperor Mines Ltd>said it will float a gold investment company in the Isle of Manto be known as &lt;Odin Mining and Investment Co Ltd>.    Sixty pct of Odin's 51 mln issued shares will be offered toEmperor shareholders on a one-for-one non-renounceable basis at1.20 Australian dlrs each, it said in a statement.    Each share will carry a free option exercisable at the sameprice up to March 1992.    Odin in turn will be allotted a 10 pct stake in Emperor at6.06 dlrs a share against the market level of about 7.70 dlrs.    Odin shares will be listed in Australia and New Zealand.    Emperor said Odin's chief activity would be strategicinvestment in emerging gold companies and projects.    Emperor's 22 pct stake in Australia's &lt;Nullarbor HoldingsLtd> and 10 pct stake in Canada's &lt;Osborne and ChappelGoldfields Ltd> will be transferred to Odin at substantialdiscounts to their market prices, it said.    The offer will not be available to shareholders registeredin the U.S. And Britain in view of compliance costs, it said.    But David Kingston, of advisers &lt;Rothschild Australia Ltd>,told Reuters those few shareholders were being urged to switchtheir registrations to an Australian nominee.    Kingston said about 65 to 70 pct of Emperor's shareholdersare domiciled outside Australia, but the vast majority areregistered through Australian nominees and are thus entitled toparticipate.    Stockbroker &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd> will underwrite the issue,Emperor said.    Odin shares are expected to be listed in May, it added.    Emperor changed its domicile to the Isle of Man fromAustralia last October because of changes in Australian taxlaws that would affect its tax position, even though it has noactivities in Australia.
