A Circuit Court judge orderedthe company that insured the solvency of International MedicalCentres Inc to show cause why it should not honour its contractwith International, according to Florida's Department ofInsurance, which had filed a petition on the matter.    As previously reported, International, the largest healthmaintenance organization in Florida, was declared insolvent onMay 14. Federal regulators had also told the company itsMedicare contract would be terminated on July 31 because of thecompany's financial and management problems.    Michelle McLawhorn, Florida Insurance Departmentspokeswoman, said International's insurer, State Mutual LifeAssurance Co of America, had made clear it would fightactivation of the policy because International did not provideit with accurate financial records.    State Mutual could not be reached for comment.    McLawhorn said it was not yet known how many creditorsInternational had or how big its debt was. The court gave StateMutual 20 days to show why it should not be obliged to payclaims against the solvency policy. Reuter&#3;
