Japanese crushers have so far bought50,000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for shipment in lateJuly/August and total purchases for the period are likely to bearound 130,000 tonnes, trade sources said.    Crushers reduced their Canadian purchases for late June andJuly to 111,000 from 120,000 tonnes due to seasonal maintenancework at oil mills.    But estimated crushers' buying for July/August was slightlyabove monthly average and is likely to keep to this level for awhile due to a better crushing margin compared with that ofsoybeans, they said.
