Middle South Utilities Inc said theU.S. Supreme Court granted the company's Mississippi Power andLight Co's request for stay of a Mississippi Supreme Courtruling blocking a portion of the utility's retail rates.    In February, the state court had returned to stateregulators a case involving the recovery of Grand Gulf onenuclear power plant costs at the rate of 28 mln dlrs per month.These rates, some of which were deferred for future phase-in,were granted by the state regulators in September 1985 based onFederal Energy Regulatory Commission allocation of the powerplant's cost among Middle South's subsidiaries.    Middle South said one condition of the stay is the postingof a bond that is suitable to the Mississippi Supreme Court.    Middle South said the Supreme Court stay brings stability toMississippi Power and Light's situation and "removes thepossibility of MP and L's imminent insolvancy while the case isproceeding on the merits."    The company said it expects its subsidiary's case toprevail on the merits, resolving for all Middle South Systemcompanies "issues concerning the prudence and retail raterecovery of costs associated with the Grand Gulf One nuclearunit."
