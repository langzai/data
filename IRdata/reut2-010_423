President Reagan vetoed an 87.5billion dlrs highway and mass transit bill calling it a budgetbuster.    The bill, which also contains a provision allowing statesto raise highway speed limits, now goes back to Congress wherethe White House faces an uphill battle to sustain the veto.    Reagan in a message to Congress said he had an alternativeproposal that would authorize 66 billion dlrs over five years,the same levels as in the Senate-passed version of the bill.    He said he recognized the states were rapidly running outof highway funds and the legislation needed to make fundsavailable for the 1987 construction season. He said was noreason why Congress could not send a new bill that he couldsign before the spring construction season was any furtheralong. Reagan supports raising the speed limit to 65 mph from55 mph on rural interstate highways. Reuter&#3;
