"We don't want to jump the fence prematurely. We want toknow the government's position first," he told a pressconference. "The new airport is still a long way away. But if itdoes go ahead we will be involved." He declined to elaborate butnoted that no other company has more at stake in a Hong Kongairport than the Swire group, which controls &lt;Hongkong AircraftEngineering Co Ltd>.    The idea for a second airport has been proposed for morethan a decade but in 1982 the government shelved the plan forbeing too expensive. Early this year a consortium led by&lt;Hopewell Holdings Co Ltd> presented the government with a 25billion H.K.

Hopewell said it will take a 20 pct stake in the projectwhile Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd &lt;CKGH.HKG> and HutchisonWhampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HKG> will take a combined 20 pct. Earliertoday Hopewell said &lt;Jardine Matheson and Co Ltd> will take afive pct interest in the project. REUTER&#3;
