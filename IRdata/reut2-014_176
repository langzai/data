More generic grain certificatesshould be released onto the market in order for the U.S.certificate program to have its full effect on commodities,according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.    The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiencypayments and paid land diversion payments in a two-thirdcertificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told aHouse agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.    Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughlya 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.    The Sparks study on certificates examined two possiblescenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a "zerocertificate case," where no certificate program was assumed,and an alternative case labeled "adequate certificate case" inwhich sufficient certificates would be released so that grainprices would not be artificially supported by market shortagesdue to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.    The study showed that total grain use under the adequatecertificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenarioby 11.2 pct.    Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grainusage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed thezero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.    For the five-year period examined, government expendituresunder the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.    The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct ofthose savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.    The study also estimated that government grain stocks underthe adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushelsbelow the zero certificate case at the end of the periodexamined.    The Sparks study said that while certificates permit marketprices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increasecommodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versuscash. Reuter&#3;
