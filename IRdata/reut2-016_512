U.S. Secretary of State George Shultzwas holding several hours of talks with Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze today in pursuit of the first superpowerarms control agreement in nearly a decade.    Shultz, accompanied by a panoply of senior advisers andtechnical experts, went directly into a closed-door meetingwith Shevardnadze and the Soviet delegation after arriving inMoscow from Helsinki aboard a U.S. Air Force jet.    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporterstraveling with the secretary that as the crucial talks gotunder way, U.S. Arms control advisers were instructed not todiscuss the substance of the American proposals with the press.    It has been reported previously that some of the proposals-- such as those dealing with President Ronald Reagan's "StarWars" space shield against enemy missiles -- represent ahardening of the U.S. Position.    Nevertheless, U.S. Officials have been optimistic about thepossibility of progress on arms control during the talks, whichare scheduled to end Wednesday.    Reagan, who is believed to want an agreement before heleaves office in 1989, said last week that a breakthrough on anaccord eliminating intermediate-range missiles (INF) in Europewas a distinct possibility.
