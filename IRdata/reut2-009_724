First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> wouldbenefit from new banking capital adequacy rules proposed by theFederal Reserve Board, Chairman Joseph Pinola said.    "We are one of the few banks that would have an improvedposition," Pinola said in an interview, noting First Interstatehas fewer off balance sheet liabilities than many other banks.    Under the proposed rules, a bank's minimum capitalrequirement would be determined by the assessed risk of theirassets, including off balance sheet liabilities that are notcurrently taken into account.    Currently, banks must retain a primary capital ratio of 5.5pct.    First Interstate reported a primary capital ratio of 6.14pct at the end of 1986.    Pinola said First Interstate has since raised that ratio,however, to about 6.70 pct, through a recent preferred stockoffering and a 200-mln-dlr subordinated capital note offeringannounced yesterday.    First Interstate reported a relatively average return onassets ratio of 0.68 at the end of 1986.    Pinola said First Interstate's return on assets ratio willimprove to the 0.70-0.71 range at the end of the first quarter,because 1986 year-end assets, at 55.4 billion dlrs, wereoverestimated by about two billion dlrs.    He said he is anxious to improve the return on assets ratiofurther, but continued loan losses at First Interstate's RockyMountain state banks continue to hold down profits.    Pinola said its banks in other states are showing excellentreturn on asset ratios, with its Arizona and Washington banksrunning at about 1.30, its Oregon bank showing 1.00 and itsCalifornia bank at about 0.83.
