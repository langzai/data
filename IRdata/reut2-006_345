A leading Soviet economist said thepractice of padding figures was significantly inflating thecountry's industrial production data.    "According to the information of state monitoring organs,the padding of figures makes up one-and-a-half to three percent of the volume of production," Alexei Sergeyev told theofficial newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya.    "In my opinion, it is significantly higher," Sergeyev, whoworks at the Economics Institute of the Soviet Union's Academyof Sciences, said.    Most Western economists have for years allowed for acertain padding of figures when analysing Soviet statistics forindustrial production.    Sergeyev said about 600 mln roubles was lost annually inraw material industries by paying wages and bonuses for workwhich was not in fact performed.    He said the elimination of figure-padding and othermalpractices would save billions of roubles and would pay forthe Soviet Union's social development program up to the year2000. REUTER&#3;
