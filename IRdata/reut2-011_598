GAF Corp chairman Samuel Heyman toldReuters he did not foresee major changes in Borg-Warner &lt;BOR>if GAF's 46 dlr-per-share offer to acquire Borg-Warner issuccessful.    "We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement," Heymansaid, following a speech at the American Institute of ChemicalEngineers annual meeting. "We don't have any particular changesin mind."    Earlier today, GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offerwas presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-basedcompany.    Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of thecompany for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to19.9 pct.    In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire UnionCarbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed aninterest in acquiring a chemical company that would complementits own chemical business.    When asked whether GAF would consider selling thenon-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer isaccepted, Heyman declined to comment.    He also refused to say whether GAF would considerincreasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if theinitial proposal is rejected.    Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer toBorg-Warner to be a friendly one.    "We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warnermanagement and good for its shareholders," Heyman said.     In his speech, Heyman said he feared too many chemicalcompanies were attempting to specialize in the same high marginniche products.    He said they were turning their backs on core commoditychemical businesses.     Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total ofseven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past twoyears to trim balance sheets.    He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry, whichreported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits, would seea 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasingexports, cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.
