Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawatold a press conference the basic solution to currencyinstability among major nations is economic policycoordination.    He said that is a time-consuming process as coordinationdoes not always proceed in a way policy makers envisage. "Thatis democracy," he said. Upon that foundation, Miyazawa said,there must be coordinated intervention. Major nations havesufficient funds to continue concerted intervention, he added.    "Without doubt this set-up of coordinated intervention willcontinue to operate," Miyazawa said.    Miyazawa said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and U.S.President Ronald Reagan are likely to reaffirm the Louvre andWashington Group of Seven (G-7) agreements on currencystability when they meet later this week.    Asked whether the dollar is declining against all majorcurrencies, not only the yen, Miyazawa declined to make anycomments.    He reiterated that many major nations have undertakencoordinated intervention in recent weeks to prop up the dollar,including countries who are not members of the G-7. Reuter&#3;
