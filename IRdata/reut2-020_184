Avon Products Inc, which earlierreported lower third quarter profits, said its fourth quarterand full year earnings will exceed the year ago results due tostrong sales in its domestic cosmetics business and an improvedeconomic situtation in Brazil.    Last year Avon earned 158.7 mln dlrs or 2.23 dlrs a shareon sales of 2.9 billion dlrs.    In the current third quarter Avon said its earnings dropped12 pct to 37 cts a share because of a wage and price freeze inBrazil, one of the company's four major operating areas.       "Themance of the domestic beauty business inthe fourth quarter should more than offset the impact of Brazilon earnings," said Hicks Waldron, Avon's chairman and chiefexecutive, in a statement.    John Cox, Avon's spokesman, told Reuters that Brazil'seconomic problems costs the company 10 cts a share or aboutseven mln dlrs in profits in the third quarter. He said thatabout half of that loss was offset by the strong performance ofthe company's domestic cosmetics business.    For the nine month period, Avon's earnings were flat.       Avon also said in a statement that an initial publicoffering in Japan for up to 40 pct of its Japanese subsidiary,which is expected to exceed 200 mln dlrs, may not take place asscheduled in November.    Avon said the offering will depend on world stock marketconditions. Reuter&#3;
