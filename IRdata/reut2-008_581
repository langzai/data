Indonesia's September devaluationhelped bank profits to rise by 28.6 pct in calendar 1986, butdespite higher world oil prices, banks are likely to seeprofits stabilise or fall in 1987, the head of Indonesia'sAssociation of Private Banks told Reuters.    Association chairman Nyoman Muna said in an interview thatmost banks made windfall profits from the 31 pct devaluationagainst the U.S. Dollar.    He saw the outlook for 1987 as more favourable forIndonesia, with oil prices now around 18 dlrs a barrel.    But he forecast that overall bank profits would probablyfall slightly from 1986 pre-tax levels, which he said wereartificially high due to the devaluation.    The Association's latest report on the performance ofIndonesia's 112 state, foreign and private banks shows thatoverall profits rose in 1986 to 495 billion rupiah from 385billion in 1985.    This was after a fall in first half profits to 202.9billion rupiah, from 238.1 billion in January-June 1985.    The report shows foreign bank profits slumped in 1986,mostly due to a loss by Bank of America NT and SA.    Bank of America, a branch of BankAmerica Corp &lt;BAC.N>, wasaffected by a string of bad debts and other problems during theyear. It showed a loss of 32.03 billion rupiah, against a lossof 3.48 billion in 1985, and 1984 profit of 7.25 billion.    A bank spokesman told Reuters he believed Bank of Americain Jakarta was now back on track. "The worst is behind us."    Its assets have fallen to 194.07 billion rupiah in 1986from 293 billion in 1985 and 301.5 billion at the end of 1984.    Indonesian profits of the 11 foreign banks allowed tooperate in Jakarta fell to 6.58 billion rupiah from 39.2billion in 1985, the report said.    These profits do not include offshore loans, which arehandled through other centres but which account for most of theforeign banks' business.    Profits of Indonesia's seven key state banks, which accountfor more than 80 pct of domestic banking assets, rose sharplyto 319.09 billion rupiah in 1986 from 212.0 billion.    Total assets of the seven rose to 40,232 billion from31,288 billion rupiah, the report said.    Profits of BNI 1946, the largest of the seven, rose to63.28 billion rupiah from 35.9 billion in 1985.    Its total assets expanded to 12,115 billion from 8,552billion at the end of December 1985.    Muna said in the fiscal year starting April 1, budgetedgovernment spending will fall in real terms. Many ministrieshave had budgets cut severely due to declining oil revenues.    "This will naturally have its impact on the banking sector,"Muna stated. "But I think that with oil around 18 dlrs, thegeneral performance of the banking sector will not be too bad."    Western bankers said the capital market remained sluggish,but Indonesia was using more foreign loans.    Bank of Tokyo &lt;BTOK.T>, the only Japanese bank allowed tooperate here, almost doubled its assets in 1986 to 607 billionrupiah from 335 billion in 1985, the report showed. But itsprofit was barely higher at 8.5 billion from 8.4 billion.    Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N> local unit Citibank, previously listedas the largest foreign bank, slipped to second place behindBank of Tokyo. It recorded a loss of 480 mln rupiah against a1985 profit of 11.9 billion.    A Citibank spokesman told Reuters the loss was abook-keeping issue and did not represent the true picture, butdeclined to give further figures.    One western banker said that "Citibank is still definitelythe largest foreign operation in Jakarta, whether or not itsprofit figures show it."    Bank of Tokyo and Citibank ranked 10th and 11th in terms ofassets of all banks in Indonesia.    The government allows only 11 foreign banks to conduct fullbanking operations, and restricts their business to Jakarta. REUTER&#3;
