Britain and Australia have offered atotal of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants tocontain rising cereal prices and help support rural employmentprojects, officials said.    They said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain wouldbe shipped next week and used for the government's "Food forWork" program in the villages.    Under the program, workers building roads, diggingirrigation canals and engaged in other rural developmentactivities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money.    The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive inBangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operationsdesigned to stop price increases, the officials said.    Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in thepast month, market sources said. But the government expectsprices to fall after the wheat harvest next month. REUTER&#3;
