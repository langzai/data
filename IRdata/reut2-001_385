Rockwell International Corpcontinues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results,despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of itsbusiness segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters.    Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter endedDecember 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, comparedto 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.    Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, andanalysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell'sAllen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in theindustrial automation market.    "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. Itis moving forward with market development and is enhancingmarket share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.    Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technologymanagement conference, said first quarter sales for theAllen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. Hesaid the company does not break out operating earnings by uniton a quarterly basis.    Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in theresearch and development phase of government contracts shouldnot have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.    He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharingcould limit technological innovation.    "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse ofcontracting approaches too early in the development stages ofimportant military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term,we have a very serious problem."    In addition, Beall told the conference the greatestcompetitive threat to defense contractors is in defenseelectronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantageof competitively priced products made outside the U.S. Reuter&#3;
