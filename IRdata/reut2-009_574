Unocal Corp said it intends toincrease its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in1987, eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986.    The company said in its annual report that it wouldincrease spending for exploration and development of petroleumresources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986's 595mln dlrs, assuming oil prices hold around current levels.    The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocalsaid.    The company's proved developed and undeveloped reserves ofcrude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil andcondensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986,compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said.    The company said its net crude oil and condensateproduction averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to251,300 bpd in 1985.    Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985's 6.19 billion. Netnatural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986,down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said.    Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrsper thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985.    Average production costs for crude oil and natural gasdeclined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalentin 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said.    In the annual report, the company called for imposition ofan oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor priceof about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil.    "Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel    will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the risein imports," Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report.    "Without decisive action in Washington, this nation willonce again become a hostage to OPEC's plans and policies,"Hartley said. Reuter&#3;
