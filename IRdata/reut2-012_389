Kenya's late coffee crop is floweringwell, but the main coffee areas were generally dry and hot inthe week ended Wednesday, trade sources said.    "Machakos, Embu, Meru and Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya, andNyeri and Thika in central, have been dry in the past week. Thefarmers expect rain this week. If it does not fall output ofthe late (October-November-December) crop will decline sharply,"one source said.    He said that since most growers did not irrigate their cropthey could do nothing but wait for rain, the main factor whichdetermines Kenyan coffee production.    Two months ago the International Coffee Organization issueda forecast of Kenyan exportable coffee production in the1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season at 1.82 mln bags. REUTER&#3;
