The U.S. Agriculture Department haslowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard redwinter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, asenior USDA official said.    USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at KansasCity and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputyadministrator of commodity operations at the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, said.    The department also lowered the terminal price of hard redspring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.    In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hardred spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not tobe identified said.    The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as atPacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.    The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and rollactivity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided uponlast week and will be effective today, he said.    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiumson high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheatprices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a proteinpremium would remain unchanged.
