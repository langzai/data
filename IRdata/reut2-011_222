&lt;Fletcher Challenge Ltd> (FCL)Managing Director Hugh Fletcher said he was disappointed that&lt;Rada Corp Ltd> had decided to sell its shares in &lt;N.Z. ForestProducts Ltd> (NZFP) to Australia's &lt;Amcor Ltd>.    He said in a statement that FCL had made an offer for the24 pct of NZFP held by Rada. He said the FCL offer was betterthan Amcor's because it would have been made to all NZFPshareholders, but he gave no further details.    Amcor and NZFP said earlier today they were merging theirpulp and paper interests in a joint partnership and wereincreasing their existing cross-shareholdings.    The plan involves NZFP increasing its current holding inAmcor to about 20 pct from four pct. Amcor will acquire Rada'sNZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seekstatutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct.    Rada bought its stake for 505.5 mln dlrs from &lt;WattieIndustries Ltd> last year, but it has not disclosed the priceto be paid by Amcor.    FCL originally launched a takeover bid for NZFP late lastyear with a scrip and/or cash offer at 3.90 dlrs a share,valuing the company at 1.3 billion dlrs. NZFP shares ended at3.88 dlrs today.
