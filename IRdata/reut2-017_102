A range of substantial policyinitiatives need to be implemented to shift resources fromconsumption to production in the Zimbabwe economy, says theZimbabwe Banking Corporation (ZBC) in its quarterly economicreview.    The state owned banking group says although Zimbabwe'sbalance of payments improved significantly last year theunderlying position deteriorated. Last year's improved tradesurplus was partly the result of sales of stockpiled gold andcontinued import restraint.    It says debt service charges are projected to exceed 35 pctof exports in 1987 and warns against squeezing imports further.    ZBC says mining industry import quotas for the first sixmonths of 1987 have been halved and those for manufacturingindustry cut by a third.    It contrasts the performance of manufacturing industry in1967 to 1974, with that since independence in 1980. Industrialproduction almost doubled between 1967 and 1974, when foreigncurrency allocations almost trebled in real terms.    Since 1980, import allocations have been cut 45 pct and theZimbabwe dollar has depreciated by more than 60 pct. As aresult the bank says the external purchasing power of foreigncurrency allocations is currently only 20 pct of its 1980levels. REUTER&#3;
