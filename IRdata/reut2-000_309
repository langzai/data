&lt;Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary ofBritish and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc &lt;BCOM.L>, said it hadagreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in &lt;RMJ HoldingsCorp> for about 79 mln dlrs.    Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition wasbeing made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>, which currentlyholds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.    Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pcteach and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.    RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of thelargest U.S. Government securities brokers.    It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and otherinstruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.    Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S.Government securities broker for the past four years and hadmade an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp&lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.    B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would bebought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting netincome of around 16 mln dlrs.    The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving ofbrokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.    Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 inthe brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, whichprovided computer software for the financial servicescommunity.    RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total marketturnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs aday, and in London where it has 15 billion.    It was also given permission last week to open an office inTokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to aboutfive billion dlrs a day.    The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct ofB and C's share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis. REUTER&#3;
