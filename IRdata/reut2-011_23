Audi of America Inc said itintroduced the "Audi Private Purchase Plan" in which it willoffer 5,000 dlr purchase certificates exclusively to currentowners of 1984-86 Audi 5000 vehicles.    It said owners must apply the certificates toward purchaseor lease of any new 1987 Audi 5000 series vehicle.    The program will run between April 1 and June 30, and morethan 150,000 certificates will be mailed.    A company spokesman said eligible owners need not trade intheir old cars to take advantage of the offer.    He also said the scheme was not prompted by the fact thatAudi had to recall thousands of its cars earlier this year tocorrect a possible defect that caused some of the cars toaccelerate suddenly.
