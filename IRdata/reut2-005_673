In what may easily be the largestinitial public offering in U.S. history, Consolidated Rail Corpestimated that the sale of its 59 mln government-owned sharescould earn the freight railroad as much as 1.7 billion dlrs.    In an amended registration statement filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, Conrail said its publicoffering could come as early as next week and estimated itsshares will sell for between 26 and 29 dlrs each, slightlyhigher than Conrail's initial prospectus had anticipated.    A sale in this price range would net between 1.53 billiondlrs and 1.7 billion dlrs for Conrail's 58.8 mln shares, with52 million sold in North American and the remainder for sale inan international offering.    The previous largest initial U.S. public offering occurredlast May when the Henley Group Inc., a diverse collection of 38companies spun off by Allied-Signal Corp, raised 1.19 billiondlrs.    In its initial prospecus filed with the SEC, Conrail hadestimated its government-owned shares would fetch only 22 to 26dlrs a share, or a maximum of 1.52 billion dlrs.    "We cannot comment on any question," said a spokesman forGoldman Sachs and Co., one of the co-managers of the sellingsyndicate. "The SEC is being extremely cautious," he said.
