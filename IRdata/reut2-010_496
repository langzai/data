Latest consumer price data indicateU.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will beabove last year's pace, economists said.    "Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this timelast year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,"said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.    U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer priceindex for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced amore moderate 1.9 pct last month.    The CPI came within the range of economists' expectationsand had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.    Among the key components of the report, transportationprices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gainreflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels anddeclines in new car prices and finance charges.    "There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,"said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Economists said the latest CPI supports existingexpectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.    The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.    Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as aresult of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energycomponent warrant attention in case gains in these areas becomefactored into the wider economic picture.    "As long as those price rises do not become entrenched incost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thusreducing international competitiveness, then the FederalReserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pctinflation," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Reuter&#3;
