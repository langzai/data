Asian countries are offering better oilexploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due tolast year's oil price slump, the United Nations said.    The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission forAsia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the pricefall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, whichfound it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region.    Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimatedto have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilledin Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985.    The report said &lt;Thai Shell Exploration and Production CoLtd>, a unit of the &lt;Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30pct cut in exploration and production spending last year.    To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reducedpetroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes.    Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pctto cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regionalexporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in1986 from 40 billion the previous year.    Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said.    Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion,China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion.    However, Asian importers saved between eight and ninebillion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably easedtheir balance of payments.    South Korea, the Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistanwere major beneficiaries, with Thailand and Pakistanrespectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year. REUTER&#3;
