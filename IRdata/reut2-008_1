Total food aid needs in 69 of theleast developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirmentsfell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, theU.S. Agriculture Department said.    In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, thedepartment said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was arecord high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.    However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened bydrought-reduced crops and civil strife.    Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheatconsumption for food to a new high, and higher yieldingvarieties have been particularly effective where spring wheatis a common crop, it said.    However, may developing countries in tropical climates,such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and CentralAmerica, are not well adapted for wheat production, andimproved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, thedepartment said.    World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in1986/87 for the third straight year.    Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oilconsumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the departmentsaid. Reuter&#3;
