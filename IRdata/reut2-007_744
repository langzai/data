Switzerland expects to launchfully computerized trading of financial futures and options inthe near future, a senior Swiss official said.    Alexis Lautenberg, minister for economic and financialservices at the Department of Foreign Affairs, said a stockindex based on issues traded on the three major Swiss exchangesis expected to be completed this month, marking "an importantstep towards the introduction of an option market and indexfutures."    Trading of options will begin next year "with more than adozen of the most actively traded shares ... and non-votingequities," he told the Futures Industry Association.    The Swiss envision requiring dealers to handle transactionson the computerized system and market makers to trade specificequities, Lautenberg said.    The Swiss official also said there would be limits on thepositions and exercise of option rights and that firms wouldhave to comply with minimum capital requirements under Swissbanking law.    He also said "intensive consultations" were under way witha view toward allowing profits earned from traded options andfinancial futures to be considered capital gains.    "It would follow that only when a buyer would exercise hisoption right by realizing a physical transaction would thestamp duty, or securities tax, be levied," Lautenberg said. Reuter&#3;
