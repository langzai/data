Bundesbank vice-president HelmutSchlesinger said that although West German economic growth wasnot expected to be satisfactory in the first 1987 quarter, twopct growth was still attainable for the whole of the year.    A further rise in the value of the mark would worsen exportprospects and have a negative effect on investments, he toldthe Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an interview. But if suchan appreciation did not materialize, the economy would expand.    The federal government has predicted a growth rate of 2-1/2pct or more in its annual economic report published in January,but some economists have said the forecast was too optimistic.    Schlesinger said private consumption was likely to risestrongly. Government expenditure and construction were alsoexpected to increase. But there was uncertainty about theprospects for exports and investment.    The Bundesbank had viewed with concern the money supplyovershoot in 1986, but the sharp rise was unlikely to have aneffect on inflation in the forseeable future. However, therewere potential dangers in the long run.    Schlesinger said there was hope that in 1987 the WestGerman money supply would grow within the three to six pcttarget zone set in December.    Schlesinger said the dampening effect on inflation of thedrop in import prices could continue to a lesser degree forsome time. Prices in West Germany were likely to rise betweenone and two pct this year.    He said 1987 would be the fifth successive growth year forthe West German economy. Although there was a possibility of adownturn at some stage in the future, there were no signs thiswould happen in 1988.    The main risks for the West German economy stemmed from itsclose ties with the rest of the world, Schlesinger added. REUTER&#3;
