U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng, reacting to recent criticism of U.S. meat inspection,defended the program saying the United States has the bestinspection system in the world.    Speaking to representatives of the U.S. NationalCattlemen's Association, NCA, Lyng attacked what he calledrecent "terribly biased" press reports critical of USDA poultryinspection. He cited a report on CBS "60 Minutes" whichcriticized USDA salmonella detection in poultry.    "I know we have the finest meat and poultry inspectionsystem in the world," Lyng told the cattlemen.    Lyng said USDA makes every effort to minimize the levels ofsalmonella in poultry, but added "the total elimination ofharmful bacteria is virtually impossible in this world." Reuter&#3;
