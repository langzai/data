The president of the Export-ImportBank said the Bank was changing its lending policies to reflectchanging conditions in export financing.    President John Bohn told a House Appropriationssubcommittee hearing commercial banks have largely withdrawnfrom financing exports and export projects were becomingsmaller.    "Exporters now need financing in riskier markets and ondeals which are smaller, take longer to put together andclose," Bohn said in his testimony. "Lenders, however, wantless risk, higher profit, transaction-oriented and lesslabor-intensive activities.    "It became clear to us the EXimbank must assume a broaderrange of explicitly defined country and transaction risks thanit has previously. Programs and procedures need to besimplified, streamlined and internally consistent," he said.    Bohn said the Bank would focus on the needs of the middlemarket product or service exporter and would have essentiallyone loan program and one guarantee program for both medium-termand long-term export transactions.    "Both programs will provide up to 85 pct financing, themaximum permitted under the OECD consensus. Eximbank loans willcarry the minimum interest rate allowed by the OECD rateschedule for the market and the term," he said.    Bohn said the Bank was requesting a limitation of 1 billiondlrs for regular loan obligations, of which up to 200 mln dlrsmay be available as tied aid credits, and a limitation of 10billion dlrs for guarantee and insurance commitments.    He said the Bank would have to come back to Congress laterthis year to discuss its capitalization needs. Reuter&#3;
