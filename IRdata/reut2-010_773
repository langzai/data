Baxter Travenol Laboratoriessaid its Hyland Therapeutics unit has started the first humanclinical trials on genetically engineered Factor VIII, theclotting agent missing from the blood of most hemophiliacs.    It said unlike Factor VIII concentrates currently in use,genetically engineered Factor VIII would not be limited by theavailability of human plasma and will be completely free fromblood-borne viruses, including AIDS and all forms of hepatitis,Baxter said.    Baxter also said it is in the final states of U.S. clinicaltrials on a highly purified form of Factor VIII derived fromhuman plasma that is produced using an advanced processincorporating monoclonal antibody purification.    It said Genetics Institute, a publicly held biotechnologycompany in which Baxter is a shareholder, will supply theprotein used for human clinical testing, as well as asubstantial portion of ongoing production requirements.
