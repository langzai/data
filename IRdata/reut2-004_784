West German banking authorities areconsidering requiring German banks to bring securities holdingsinto lending ratio calculations used to regulate credit risk,banking sources said.    The present interpretation of the credit law limits banks'maximum lending to 18 times eligible capital -- reserves plusequity capital -- but sets no restraints on securitiesholdings.    Under new provisions, weightings would be attached tosecurities similar to those used for lending. Weightings wouldrange from a zero rating for no-risk assets to 100 pct of totalasset value for what authorities consider the highest risk.    Low-risk securities carrying a zero rating would includepublic authority bonds for the federal government, states andmunicipalities, the sources said.    A 20 pct rating would be assigned to issues of domesticbanks. Secured bonds of mortgage, shipping and public authoritybanks would be an exception to this, via such securities asmortgage and municipal bonds.    Securities issued by foreign banks would attract aweighting of 50 pct, while authorities are consideringrequiring banks to include 100 pct of the value of debt assetsof foreign issuers, including sovereign borrowers.    The sources said the revision is still being discussed, andrequired approval by the federal Banking Supervisory Office inWest Berlin, the Bundesbank, and West Germany's four bankingassociations.    The move is a response to the increasing securitisation ofdebt markets, they added. Reuter&#3;
