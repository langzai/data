Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpinstarts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisorycommittee in New York tomorrow, buoyed by an economy on themend and political stability one year after President CorazonAquino took power, central bank officials said.    The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billiondlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due betweenJanuary 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack onanother 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to anynew agreement, the officials said.    Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentagepoint over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) andVenezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBORportend well for the Philippines, despite Brazil's repaymentsuspension last week, the officials said.    Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a77 billion dlr rescue.    Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which iscurrently hovering around 6-1/2 pct.    The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offeredwhen the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7.    Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments.    One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-typeaccord, which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusingto endorse five months after it was signed.    In Manila's case, about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrsoutstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large bankson the advisory committee, while about 180 smaller banks haveaverage exposures of 20 mln dlrs each.
