The Soviet Union would likely be moreinterested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking anygrain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.    Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchasesuntil the condition of winter and spring crops is better knownmake new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.    "Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offereda subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respondto," Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusinesseducation conference here. But if there are too manyconstraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take lessthan an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.    Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put SovietUnion wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidyoffer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,Moscow would likely buy more, he said.    "If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, Iexpect they'll take it," said Vernon McMinimy, director ofcommodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.    McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact oncrops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under asubsidy offer.    Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start becauseof a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather thannormal," McMinimy said.
