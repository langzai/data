The staff of the federal Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that theWashington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged withsecurities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on2.25 billion dlrs of bonds, a WPPSS official told Reuters.    WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised bySEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would beasked to charge WPPSS in connection with its officialstatements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclearpower plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it wasselling the bonds.    English, in a telephone interview, said the SEC staffplanned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand forpower in the region and had understated the cost of the plants,which were to built with the bonds' proceeds.    English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS had made nopublic forecasts of power demand in connection with the bondsale and had never understated the cost of the plants.    "We at all times told the public everything we knew aboutthe costs," he said.    English said WPPSS had no indication when the SEC mightmeet on the staff's recommendations.    The SEC, as a matter of policy, never comments on itsenforcement activities.    The SEC's WPPSS investigation began in late 1983 and theagency's slow pace on the probe has been publicly criticized onseveral occasions since then by Rep. John Dingell, the MichiganDemocrat who chairs the House panel responsible for the SEC'sbudget and operations.    Of the five nuclear plants originally envisioned by WPPSS,one has been completed, two remain under construction, and twoothers--those for which the defaulted bonds were sold-- havebeen terminated.
