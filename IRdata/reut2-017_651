Southam Inc said a Canadian governmentofficial asked the Ontario Supreme Court to order Southam toseek shareholder approval of a 1985 share swap between Southamand fellow newspaper publisher Torstar Corp &lt;TSB.TO>.    Frederick Sparling, an official in the Department ofConsumer and Corporate Affairs, wants the share exchangenullified if shareholder approval is not obtained, Southamadded.    Southam said it believed it had acted properly and wouldvigorously defend itself in what would probably be a lengthyprocess.    Sparling's action came after a year-long investigation bythe federal corporations branch in response to minorityshareholders' complaints about the share exchange, which gaveTorstar a 22 pct stake in Southam.    Southam said at the time of the Torstar deal that the shareswap was necessary to avert a hostile takeover bid for Southamby a third party.    The company declined further comment while the case isbefore the courts. Reuter&#3;
