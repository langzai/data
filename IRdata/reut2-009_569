ICN Pharmaceutical Inc saidit did not view Eastman Kodak Co's &lt;EK> decision to sell its2.3 pct share of ICN's common stock as having any effect on thestatus of its drug ribavirin or the previously reported ongoingdevelopment of that drug in the antiviral field.    ICN recently submitted data to the Food and DrugAdministration on studies using its antiviral drug ribavirinfor treating some AIDS-related disorders.    In a statement, ICN also said the sale will not effect itspreviously announced plans to seek an acquisition of a majorpharmaceutical company.    ICN also said the planned sale will have no effect on itslong-term research partnership with Kodak and Kodak's continuedfunding of the Nucleic Acid Research Institute.    Two years ago Kodak agreed to invest 45 mln dlrs over sixyears to form and operate a venture with ICN to explore newbiomedical compounds. It acquired a 2.3 pct stake in ICN as aresult of that agreement.    ICN said Kodak today confirmed to ICN its continuingconfidence in the progress of the joint project.    ICN also said although there were discussions today betweenICN and Kodak regarding a private sale of the shares to ICN, nodecision has been made on this matter. Reuter&#3;
