GTE Corp said it supportsrecommendations by the Department of Justice to allow theregional Bell companies to enter some new businesses but thatit rejects the government's proposal to let the companies offerlong distance services.    "As a vigorous competitor in many telecommunicationsbusinesses, GTE supports efforts by policy makers to preserveand promote fair opportunities for competition," GTE said incomments filed with the U.S. District Court, which oversees theregulation of the Bell companies.    But the Stamford, Conn.-based company added that entry bythe regional Bell companies into the long distnce market "wouldset back the progress toward a truly competitive interexchangeenvironment that has occurred."
