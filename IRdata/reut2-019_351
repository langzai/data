A U.S. government trade officialresponsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord oncoffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombianefforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.    Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative justback from trade talks in Colombia, said most producingcountries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must beagreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.    "There is one country which evidently still does not,"Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which hasbeen negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.    Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlookfor an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the SeptemberInternational Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.    He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technicaldiscussions with Colombian officials.    While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of theColombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.    The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last monthwhich praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formulafor the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concernswith the technical details of the Colombian plan.    Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for commenton a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to byEuropean coffee roasters and traders.    Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horicksaid in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year movingaverages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota forthe remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.    The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotasunless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in thecoffee market are used to set export limits. Reuter&#3;
