The House of Representatives passed aresolution urging President Reagan to negotiate a world-widetreaty to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons which aredepleting the earth's ozone layer.    Chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals used in aerosol sprays,refrigeration, air conditioning, foam insultation, fireextinguishers and cleaning solvents. They were banned in theUnited States and Canada in 1978, but are still widely used inEurope and Japan.       The ozone layer of the atmosphere protects the earthagainst ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.    Scientists have warned that if chlorofluocarbons continueto deplete the ozone layer, the additional ultraviolentradiation striking the earth will cause a higher rate of skincancer.    The non-binding resolution was passed by voice vote. Reuter&#3;
