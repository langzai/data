Texaco Inc said it filed apetition in the Texas Court of Appeals for relief of the bondand lien provisions of the 10.3 billion dlr judgement in itslegal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    Earlier today, a lawyer for Pennzoil told Reuters a filinghad been made in the Texas court of Appeals.    "The petition asks the court to determine a reasonablesecurity arrangement between Texaco and Pennzoil," Texaco saidin a statement.    Texaco also said it asked the court for a temporaryrestraining order against Pennzoil's enforcement of the 10.3billion dlr judgement until the petition is resolved.    According to Texas law, Texaco could be forced to post thefull amount of the judgement as a bond. If it fails to do so,Pennzoil could seek liens against Texaco's assets for the fullamount of the judgement.    Yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court stuck down a lower federalcourt ruling which had cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs.It said the issue should first be considered in Texas stateCourts.    Earlier, the attorney for Pennzoil said Texaco hadsuggested a bond of one to 1.5 billion dlrs as a reasonableamount in today's filing.
