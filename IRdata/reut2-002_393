Delegates from the National PorkProducers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congressin Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S.congress not to change the farm bill. While there are nospecific pork items in that legislation, feed grain pricesdirectly affect pork producer profits, the NPPC said.    Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said "to haveunpredictable changes come along periodically makes it verydifficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption."    Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections butthat's a price pork producers are willing to pay forlegislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said.    Delegates also passed unanimously a resolution thatCongress and the administration should act swiftly to identifyproblems in the farm credit system.    Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected VicePresident of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted aprogram that all commodity groups can work with and bring a resolution to this problem with legislators in Washington.    Hankes added that the National Pork Producers Council willwork to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to saveor create any one credit system. Reuter&#3;
