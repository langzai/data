&lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd>,41 pct owned by &lt;Hees International Corp>, said earnings andcash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas pricesremain at 1986 levels.    The improvement will result from production increases,lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and fromoperating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during1986, the company said in the annual report.    Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985.    Norcen's 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year.    It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was themost significant factor for Norcen's reduced performance.    "While financial results are far from the previous year'srecord levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood decliningprices and remains financially and operationally strong," Norcensaid. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.    The company said it is well positioned to capitalize onprofitable opportunities in its core business areas, and willcontinue to invest to increase revenue and asset values. Reuter&#3;
