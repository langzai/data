Venezuela's biggest private sectorcompany, La Electricidad de Caracas, will meet urgently withbank creditors in New York on monday to discuss the danger of atotal default on its 622 mln dlr foreign debt, a companyspokesman said.    "We are in an impossible situation, unless we getgovernment relief the company will be bankrupt in three years,"he told reuters.    La Electricidad's problems stem from the government'sdecision in december to set private debt payments at 7.50bolivars per dlr instead of 4.3, adding 74 pct to the debt inbolivar terms.    La Electricidad is seeking permission for a 50 pct increasein industrial and commercial tariffs, which officials say wouldbring in an extra 1.3 billion bolivars this year.    A 30 pct tariff increase introduced in january will onlybring in an extra 600 mln bolivars per year as againstadditional debt costs of 900 mln. Reuter&#3;
