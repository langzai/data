Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid toraise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy MinisterArturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.    He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota incompensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oilproduction when its main pipeline was destroyed by anearthquake last March.    "For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise itsright to produce 221,000 bpd," he said. "We should recognizeEcuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis ofjustice in that country's petition."    He added however, the quota increase should be gradual toavoid harming the market, he added.    Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador wouldformally submit the request for a higher quota at the nextministerial conference of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.
