Lucky Stores Inc said it andinvestor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibitsEdelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtaincontrol of the company and that limits the Edelman group'sownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any votingsecurities.    The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pendinglitigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.    The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman'smotion to intervene in pending shareholder actions againstLucky Stores and its directors, the company said.    In addition, the standstill provisions also apply toHancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, thecompany said.    Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for thecompany to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set forDecember 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their viewsconcerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the votingpower of substantial Lucky stockholders.    Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.    Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuringprogram that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its owncommon shares and reincorporation in Delaware.    The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retailstores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.    Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnershipsubsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposedreincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase andrestructuring plan.    Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreedto reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs ofout-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and othercosts.    "This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholdersby avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation andthe accompanying demands on management time," Lucky Storeschairman John Lillie said in a statement.
