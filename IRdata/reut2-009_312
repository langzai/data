Bristol-Myers Co said it has filed aninvestigational new drug application with the U.S. Food andDrug Administration requesting the agency to allow it to begintesting its AIDS vaccine in humans.    The company said it filed the application on behalf of itsOncogen subsidiary, which developed the vaccine. It did notname the drug.    Bristol-Myers, the third largest drug company in the U.S.,said that "considerable work remains to be done before it isdetermined whether a new drug application will be develpoed forsubmission to FDA."    An investigational new drug application is the first stepin testing an agent. After clinical studies establish thesafety and efficacy of an agent, a company then submits a newdrug application to the FDA.
