The Securities Industry Association,SIA, has asked the U.S. supreme court to overturn a lower-courtruling that would allow banks to sell commercial paper, SIAgeneral counsel William Fitzpatrick said.    In a petition, the SIA said the court of appeals erred inupholding the decision of the Federal Reserve board ofgovernors to permit Bankers Trust New York Corp &lt;BT> tounderwrite and distribute commercial paper.    The SIA charged that the Fed's ruling violates the 1933Glass-Steagall Act barring banks from underwriting most typesof securities.    The court of appeals decision, issued last December,reversed an earlier district court ruling that sellingcommercial paper is an improper bank activity and that privateplacements by banks is also improper.    In an earlier round of the case, decided in 1984, theSupreme Court upheld the SIA's contention that commercial paperis a security for the purposes of th Glass-Steagall Act.    The SIA is a trade association representing the interestsof more than 500 U.S. investment banks and securities firms. Reuter&#3;
