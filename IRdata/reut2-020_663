EC agriculture ministers attackedplans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear thatcereals output is above standard norms, EC sources said.    They said this was the major criticism raised at a meetingof ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbingspending on the cereals regime.    The Commission wants powers to cut guaranteed prices orraise the coresponsibility levy if output next harvest risesabove 155 mln tonnes.    The sources said several ministers complained that changingprice levels in the middle of a season would severely damagethe financial security of farmers.    But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner FransAndriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed securityregardless of market circumstances.    The sources said there was a general acceptance of the needfor some output ceilings. However, the French and Dutchministers called for a maximum output for a wider range ofcereal crops, rather than for cereals alone.    The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilingsfor individual countries with excess production being paid forfrom national exchequers, but received no support for thisidea.    British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters hedetected more support for his position against the penalties onfarmers being administered through higher coresponsibilitylevies.    He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothingto increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices forfarmers could help in this direction. Reuter&#3;
