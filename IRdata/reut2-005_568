The New York Stock Exchange said itwill cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission bydisclosing imbalances in market-on-close orders in 50 majorstocks thirty minutes prior to the close of trading Friday.    The procedure will be followed this Friday when stock indexfutures and options and individual stock options expiresimultaneously. Such triple expirations occur four times a yearand in the past have been associated with big swings in stockmarket averages. In a new variation of the disclosure rules,the NYSE said no market-on-close orders related to indexarbitrage can be entered after 1530 EST.    The NYSE said all market-on-close orders for 50 bigcapitalization stocks, including the 30 components of the DowJones Industrial Average, must be entered by 1530 EST Friday.The NYSE will then furnish to financial news services anyimbalance in market-on-close orders of 10,000 shares or more.    After 1530 EST market-on-close orders in the 50 stocks canbe entered only on the opposite side of the imbalance. But thebar on entering market-on-close orders related to indexarbitrage after 1530 EST is a new element of the disclosureplan, which has the goal of making the market less volatileduring the triple expirations.
