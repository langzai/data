Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> has found cracks inthe tails of two of its own DC-10 aircraft made by McDonnellDouglas Corp &lt;MD.N> and a third belonging to the Dutch airlineKLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS>, a Swissair spokesman said.    A Swissair spokesman said the cracks, in the horizontaltail surface, came to light during routine maintenance of theDutch aircraft here on March 18.    Subsequent checks on Swissair's 11 DC-10s showed similarproblems, thought to be due to material fatigue, he said.    The spokesman said the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority(FAA) and McDonnell Douglas have ordered checks of all 400DC-10s in use by airlines worldwide.    Swissair said both the FAA and Swiss aviation authoritieshad allowed it to continue to fly its DC-10s on condition thedamage was repaired and planes were checked after each landing.    Several days ago, Swissair announced a firm order for sixMcDonnell Douglas's MD-11s, with an option for 12 more, toreplace its DC-10s. The MD-11 is a development of the DC-10. REUTER&#3;
