A company spokesman said the proposals appear to have beenmade in today's edition of the Japanese daily Asahi by FumioWatanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with theFederation of Economic Organisations.    However, the suggestion still recommended a merger betweenthe two consortia tendering for contracts and would give Cablea five pct stake, more than the three pct originally proposedbut less than the 20 pct it holds in its original venture, hesaid.    The proposal would also offer a Cable nominee a seat on theboard of the merged company.    The spokesman said he believed Japan should acceptapplications from the two rivals for fair review.
