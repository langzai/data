ESSO SAF &lt;ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiaryof Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, said it had no immediate plans to shutdown one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R.Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a Frenchrefinery.    An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis thatdepended on the evolution of the market and refineries' abilityto make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos surMer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investmentover 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.    The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacityof seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, thespokesman added.    Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of wouldbe Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the PortJerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising apetrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.    Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview thatExxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and mightdecide to close one of its French refineries. Reuter&#3;
