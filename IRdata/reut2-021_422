China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the NewChina News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesmanas saying.    The harvest will be China's second highest in history butpoor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmershave kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mlntonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mlntonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09mln in the same 1986 period.    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state pricesfor grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increasethe incentive for grain production.    China could not afford to become a major food importer, hesaid.    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390mln tonnes.
