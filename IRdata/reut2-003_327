A top Treasury official said he doesnot expect any comprehensive Congressional reform of the U.S.banking industry until after the 1988 presidential election dueto political pressures and, to a lesser extent, the insidertrading scandal on Wall Street.    George Gould, Under Secretary of the Treasury, told a WallStreet Planning Group luncheon, "legislation is not going tohappen before the election ... (people) do not like to vote oncontroversial issues in election years."    "It may take a while in the next administration ... to getsomething done," he added.    Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry,which would probably feature wider investment banking powersfor commercial banks, has met strong opposition from privateinterest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.    "These discussions have nothing to do with merit ... thesegroups are trying to cloak self-interest in public policyterms," Gould said. "It is easier to stop something than it isto get it going."    He also described current concern about insider trading as"a major impediment to further progress ... it is not a helpfulbackdrop to accomplish financial reform."    Similarly, Gould said lobbying by such groups as the U.S.League of Savings Institutions would probably mean that theReagan Administration's proposal for the recapitalization ofthe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp would be watereddown.    Gould foresaw a five billion dlr injection over two years,compared with the original request for 15 billion dlrs overthree years.    Gould ruled out any new government initiative on bankingreform but said that some broad guidelines to address theseissues would be made public over the next few months. Reuter&#3;
