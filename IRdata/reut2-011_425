The United States and Japan are notinvolved in a trade war, despite U.S. sanctions announced lastweek against Japanese semiconductors, U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said.    "In my judgement, we're not even close to a trade war,"Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing.    Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreementwith the U.S. on semiconductor trade, "Then the retaliatoryresponse will last a relatively short period."    Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in thirdcountries and buy more American computer chips. Reuter&#3;
