Workers at a General Motors Corpparts plant in Michigan are scheduled to vote tomorrow on a newcontract that would change the way many of the workers do theirjob.    Some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers at GM'sLivonia, Mich., parts plant will vote in two shifts on a localcontract to replace their current agreement with the company,according to officials of both the union and the company.    The proposed accord would initiate the so-called "teamconcept" at the plant, which makes seat cushions and is part ofGM's Inland Division.    Under the proposed contract, workers in one area of theplant would be responsible for the entire product and wouldmake some of their own decisions about assembling that product,said Kevin Woodward, a steward with the UAW local thatrepresents the workers.    An Inland division spokesman would not discuss details ofthe accord. But he said Inland has a "serious" capacityproblem.    No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal. Those issuesare covered by a national pact between GM and the UAW. Talks ona new national accord are expected to begin in July.    If the contract is ratified, it would go into effect assoon as the vote count is completed, said Ronald Catcher, amember of the local's executive board.    The pact would also stay in place through the next nationalcontract, he said.    Catcher said the union members are sharply divided on thenew accord. "It's going to be close either way," he said.    Many of the workers are afraid that, if the agreement isnot ratified, the plant will be shut down, union officialssaid. The GM spokesman said "no decision has been made to thateffect." Reuter&#3;
