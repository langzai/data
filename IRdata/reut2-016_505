Argentine Treasury Secretary MarioBrodersohn said the country is near accord with creditor bankson refinancing about 30 billion dlrs of foreign debt.    Brodersohn, in an interview from Washington with Argentinetelevision, said Saturday the major obstacles to an agreementwith creditor banks had been overcome. "Only details remain tobe resolved," he said.    Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille on Thursday in a speechat the IMF accused creditor banks of standing in the way of anaccord by demanding conditions incompatible with Argentina'sIMF standby program.    Brodersohn said that since there "has been progress. I'dsay that we are now working on the fine print of theagreement."    Negotiations between Argentina and the banks have beenstuck over differences on the question of capitalisation of thedebt as well as on-lending programs.    Argentina has resisted a renewal of on-lending programs andsought an agreement whereby creditor banks would invest a freshdollar for every dollar of debt capitalised. Reuter&#3;
