U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said agriculture should share spending cuts under theGramm-Rudman law and that this would ultimately help exports.    "There needs to be some reduction of some expenditures to atleast get close to the Gramm-Rudman figure," he said."Agriculture would not be independent from that."    He told a Virginia Farm Bureau lunch, "I don't think anyonebelieves we'll meet the 108 billion dlr target."    Lyng said if the federal deficit came down, this would helpexports. "A failure to get the fiscal deficit under control ishaving a harmful effect on agricultural exports."    He added, however, that U.S. agricultural exports hadincreased under the Farm Security Act but so far had notrecovered to what he called the successful levels of 1981. Reuter&#3;
