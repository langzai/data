The quarterly session of theInternational Tin Council (ITC) continued without formalagreement on an extension of the sixth International TinAgreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was ageneral consensus the Agreement should be prolonged.    Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructionsfrom capitals, but informally most have indicated they favouran extension, delegates said.    This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seekfurther clarification on some of the issues involved, and todiscuss internal matters.    Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extensioncould be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special sessionwould be convened to adopt the resolution after the Associationof Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.    The full Council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 GMT aftera European Community coordination meeting at 1100. Reuter&#3;
