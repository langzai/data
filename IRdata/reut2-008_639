Iran has test-fired its newly acquiredSilkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and hasset up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, aBritish naval source in the Gulf said.    The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran hadfired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulfnaval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.    "These missiles pack a fairly big punch," he told Reuters."There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping)across the Strait of Hormuz." Reuter&#3;
