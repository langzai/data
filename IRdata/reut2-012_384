Interest rates on the London money marketwere slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against thedollar and mark, dealers said.    They said this had come as a surprise and expected thetargets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in theforeign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower intrade weighted terms at 71.3.    Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve hisgoals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currencymarkets and interest rates.    Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to teststerling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall inU.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term,dealers said.    The feeling remains in the market, however, thatfundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise inU.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expectedto continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10pct base rate level, for some time.    The key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmerat 10 9-7/8 pct.&#3;
