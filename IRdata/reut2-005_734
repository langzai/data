India is preparing to launchits first intercontinental-range rocket, which it insists ispart of a purely peaceful space program.    But a space department official who did not wish to beidentified said the Augmented Space Launch Vehicle (ASLV), withthe range of an intercontinental rocket and able to carry a150-kg satellite, could be converted into a weapon aftermodifications.    Space Commission Chairman Udipi Ramachandra Rao said theASLV will be launched between March 20 and April 5, dependingon weather and other factors.    "This launch will pave the way for the most important stage,by the end of 1989, when we test the Polar Space Launch Vehicle(PSLV)," Rao told Reuters.    The space department official said the PSLV would be ableto launch 1,000-kg satellites into polar orbit.    Rao said a successful ASLV launch could speed up the spaceprogram slightly but was not likely to solve the problem of abackup satellite for India's Insat 1B.    Insat 1B handles telephone communications, controls 182 ofthe country's 187 television stations and providesmeteorological data for farmers.    "It is a great worry that we do not have a second satelliteto back up Insat 1B in case it fails. Even with Insat 1C'slaunch by Ariane in the first quarter of 1988, we will still bein trouble because the life of Insat 1B ends in 1989," Rao said.    He said India plans to send up Insat 1D as soon as possibleas a backup for Insat 1C, but will have to wait for a place ona NASA or Ariane launch vehicle. "We can't use Soviet vehiclesbecause the satellites are made in the United States," he said. REUTER&#3;
