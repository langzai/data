The State Department says many U.S.diplomatic missions overseas are on high alert for possibleretaliation from Iran for Monday's attack on two Iranian oilplatforms by American forces in the Gulf.    At the same time, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday thatU.S. forces have begun escorting another Kuwaiti tanker convoysouthward through the Gulf from Kuwait.    The State Department renewed its warning to Americans notto travel to Iran because of what spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleycalled, "its virulent anti-American policies and support forterrorism."    "The threat to Americans has increased significantly," shesaid in announcing that the department was reiterating adviceit last made in January. The department said about 2,600American citizens live in Iran, the overwhelming majority dualnationalities.
