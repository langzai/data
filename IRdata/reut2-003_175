The proposed 757 mln dlr deal underwhich Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp wasdescribed by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies.    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC commonstock could be fairly valued at "just under five dlrs a share"given changes brought by tax reform and that Chrysler's offerto pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders otherthan Renault as a "a good price for Chrysler.    AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning afterthe Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chryslershares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4.    Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studyingthe proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said heregarded the proposal as a "done deal" because "I can't believeanybody else would make a bid."    "It's a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst toldReuters.    "Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC)Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier(mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers willhave more confidence that the manufacturer will still be aroundto service the products," Glantz said.    Analyst Thomas O'Grady said Chrysler would be getting moremanufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada,for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some returnafter its prolonged loss-making investment in AMC.
