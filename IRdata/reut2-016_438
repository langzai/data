The Bank of England will step upreporting requirements for primary dealers in U.K. Governmentgilts during the when-issued trading period in between the datean auction is announced and the date the sale is actually held.    In its document on the auctions, the Bank said "The Bank iscontent for such (when-issued) trading to cevelop subject tocertain conditions, in particular for predential supervision ofthe credit risk to which the gilt-edged market makers andInter-dealer brokers may become exposed."    The Bank is widely expected to require dealers to reportwehn-issued trading positions on a daily basis.    When-issued trading presents certain unusual risks becausedealers are buying and selling a security that technically doesnot exist although there is no uncertainty about when it willbe issued.    Still, the fact there is no physical delivery possiblepresents certain credit risks as well.    The Bank is widely expected to expand its reportingrequiremenmts for unsettled trades, requiring firms to reportunsettled when-issued trades one day after they occur.Normally, unsettled trades must be reported three days afterthey occur.
