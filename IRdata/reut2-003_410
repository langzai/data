Japanese crushers are likely to buy atleast 200,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year andanother 100,000 to 200,000 if quality and shipping conditionsare good against 128,089 tonnes in 1986, trade sources said.    A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said.    "Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents abushel cheaper than U.S. Origin due to the bumper harvest, itis highly likely that Japanese crushers will increase theirbuying volume," one source said. Brazilian beans are availableto Japan for shipment from May to July. REUTER&#3;
