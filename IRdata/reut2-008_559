World Bank president Barber Conablepledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lowerworld oil prices, but said further deregulation of itsprotected economy was needed.    Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise theeconomy and deregulate trade policy.    Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year whichcut the value of its crude exports in half, is the ThirdWorld's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrsfrom the World Bank in the past 20 years.    Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, wasprepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust tolower oil and primary commodity prices.    "We are prepared to support those steps which we believe areconsistent with the development of the Indonesian economy," hesaid.    He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after lastyear's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of thedifficulties now faced by other countries.    Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against thedollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, andhas announced a series of measures since May intended tostimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalisethe economy.    However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plasticsand high tariff barriers remain in place.    Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country'sborrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on thecountry. REUTER&#3;
