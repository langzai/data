Switzerland recorded last year its firstoverall surplus in government finances since 1974, ending witha net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs, the Finance Ministrysaid.    The surplus, including cash transactions and long-terminvestments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billionfrancs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986budget.    All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, andexpenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast.    The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61billion proposed in the original 1986 budget.    Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985deficit of 696 mln.    Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs aboveforecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expectedreceipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions.    Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more thanplanned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said.    The ministry said the improvement in the overall accountreflected years of efforts by the government and parliament tointroduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary taxincreases. But economic factors, including the low rate ofinflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oilprices were also important factors.    A spokesman for the ministry said the government had usedits improved cash position to retire about one billion francsof government debt, which accounted for the difference betweenthe 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mlnfranc overall surplus.
