A Texas State Court of Appeal agreedthat Texaco Inc's bankruptcy petition effectively stays thecompany's obligation under Texas law to post a bond in its10.53 billion dlr litigation against Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    In a brief hearing before a three-judge appeals court,Texaco attorney James Sales said the company's motion to reducethe amount of bond required to appeal the case was moot becauseTexaco's Chapter 11 petition protects the company from allpreviously existing debts and obligations.    Lawyers for Pennzoil, which won the 10.53 billion dlrjudgment in a struggle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty OilCo, did not object.    Texaco lawyers said they planned to pursue the appeal inTexas courts and in Federal courts, if necessary.    The Texaco lawyers said the company would seek permissionfrom the bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New Yorkto pursue the Pennzoil litigation. Reuter&#3;
