The Soviet oil production target for 1988has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes overthis year's planned output.    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesdayat the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oildeposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed anupsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnationwhich began in late 1983.    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.    January-September figures released at the weekend showedSoviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oildeposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geologprospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday. REUTER&#3;
