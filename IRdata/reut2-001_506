The cost of living in West Germany willlikely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct inthe first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, theHWWA economic research institute said.    The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from thefading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and thevalue of the dollar, the institute said in a report.    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in thecourse of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as awhole because year on year rates will remain negative in thefirst part of 1987.    Provisional inflation figures for February released lastweek showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lowerthan in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pctagainst the same month a year earlier.    The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remainaround 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17dlrs per barrel. REUTER&#3;
