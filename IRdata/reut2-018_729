Enzon Inc and EastmanKodak Co's Eastman Pharmaceuticals division said the Food andDrug Administration approved their application to allowclinical testing of the PEG-uricase drug to proceed.    Kodak owns 18.7 pct of Enzon and owns the marketing rightsfor PEG-uricase and two other drugs Enzon is developing.    The companies said PEG-uricase is intended to reduce uricacid levels in patients undergoing chemotherapy and sufferingfrom gout. A build up of uric acid in the bloodstream, a commonside effect of chemotherapy, often leads to kidney failure.    Enzon said that under the FDA's new rules to allow patientswith life-threatening diseases to get investigational drugs,uric acid levels in an extremely ill patient decreased tonormal levels within 48 hours after the drug was injected.    Separately, it said the FDA granted it permission toinclude an unlimited number of patients in trials with PEG-ADA,a drug used to treat a rare and usually fatal disease inchildren called severe combined immuodeficiency.    It said five children are being treated with the drug andit hopes to file a new drug application PEG-ADA by late 1987.When the NDA is approved, the drug can be marketed. Reuter&#3;
