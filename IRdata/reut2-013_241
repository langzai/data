West Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU)and their liberal Free Democrat Party (FDP) allies today woncontrol of the central state of Hesse in state elections,toppling the Social Democrats (SPD) who had governed the statefor over 40 years.    The CDU/FDP coalition will have a two-seat majority overthe SPD and their Greens party allies in the new stateparliament. Earlier predictions forecast a hung parliament.    The poll was the first major test of public opinion sincenational elections last January returned Chancellor HelmutKohl's CDU-dominated coalition to power in Bonn.    Political commentators said the result was a debacle forthe SPD, which has been split by disagreements over the party'sfuture direction. It was also a rebuff for a unique coalitionthe SPD had formed in Hesse with the anti-nuclear Greensmovement, which left-wing Social Democrats said could provide amodel for a similar alliance at federal level.    Bonn Environment Minister Walter Wallmann, the CDU'svictorious candidate for the state premiership, told reporters"Many traditional SPD voters voted for us because they did notwant an SPD that was under the influence of the Greens."
