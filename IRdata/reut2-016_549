The Environmental Protection Agency'sfive to 10 mln dlr suit against a Browning-Ferris IndustriesInc &lt;BFI> unit, CECOS International Inc, caused the stock todrop today, analysts said.    The stock has fallen 2-1/4 to 56-1/8 so far today, afterthe news about the suit was released this morning.    "It's potentially a big suit and investors feel that itsnot good to go against regulators," Kenneth Ch'u-K'ai Leung, aSmith Barney analyst said.    "What investors are actually saying by selling off some BFIshares is the cloud over this industry is the threat that theEPA will get tough on waste management companies," WillardBrown, senior analyst for First Albany Corp.    "Investors are saying to themselves that waste managementcompanies have that kind of exposure to regulatory suits,"Brown said. Brown said if the suit were settled for 10 mln dlrsit would have an impact on Browning Ferris earnings.    Leung said, however, that Browning-Ferris has adequate cashreserves to cover the fine. "It would have no impact onearnings whatsoever," he said. Reuter&#3;
