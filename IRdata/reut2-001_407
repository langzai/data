European Community Farm CommissionerFrans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairyoutput cuts over two years and promised new measures to helpfarmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses.    "We are now in a favourable position to improve thesituation in the dairy sector," he told a news conference.    The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billionEuropean Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes ofbutter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major newstocks from accruing.    A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached inDecember, but approval was held up by a row over Commissionproposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplusstocks into store.    After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailedrules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new publicstocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market priceswere sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores.    Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for whathe said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals forcuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the comingseason.    The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecupackage of measures to help farmers in difficulty and paycompensation to those who opt for less intensive productionmethods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objectionshad forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for whichhe had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years.    He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow olderfarmers to take early retirement, either taking their land outof agricultural production or passing it to successors.    The Commission is also working on proposals to enable theEC and member states to provide direct income supports tohard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not givefull details, but member state aid would be subject to "strictcriteria to avoid distortion of competition." Reuter&#3;
