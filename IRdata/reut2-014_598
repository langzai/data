President Quett Masire appealed forinternational aid to combat the effects of a drought ravagingland-locked Botswana for the sixth consecutive year.    Speaking on state radio, Masire said the drought haddecimated herds of cattle and wiped out crops throughout themainly desert country, which would be forced to rely on SouthAfrica for most of its food supplies in the coming year.    Masire said the government would also be forced to continuea drought relief program until at least the end of 1988 toprovide emergency water supplies and supplementary food tovulnerable sections of the population.    "It is against this background that we appeal to theinternational community for assistance," Masire said.    He thanked foreign governments for previous assistance, butadded, "The needs of the people in rural areas are greater now,not less. We must prevent the human suffering caused bymalnutrition."
