The bank previously said in January that it preferred toestablish its own securities unit rather than acquire anexisting investment dealer.    "Full TSE access will enable us to provide an even higherlevel of customer service and maintain Green Line's position asan industry leader," said Toronto Dominion president RobertKorthals in a statement.    He told reporters at a news conference that the bank agreedto purchase the seat for 195,000 dlrs from Hector M. Chisholmand Co.
