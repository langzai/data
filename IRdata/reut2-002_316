Charles Haughey, leader of the Irishparty Fianna Fail, said if he becomes prime minister followinglast month's Irish general election, he will seek the advice ofthe EC Commission on management of the country's 24 billionpunt foreign debt.    Haughey told a news conference he is confident of beingasked to form a government when the Irish parliament meets nextTuesday. Fianna Fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the February 17poll. Haughey said an offer of Commission help on debtmanagement was made to him today by Commission presidentJacques Delors.    Haughey said:" Delors assured me we could have full recourseto the Commission for advice, guidance and expert skills indealing with our overall financial problems, particularily inthe matter of debt management."    Noting current debt servicing charges are about two billionpunts a year, he added :"If we could achieve any significantimprovement in the management and reduction in the cost ofservicing, it could have significant budgetary benefits."    He added that he would seek advice, not a Community loan.    However, Haughey said Ireland had in the past used itsposition within the EMS to make borrowings in Europe atfavorable interest rates, notably for onlending to its farmingsector.    "It is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of beforeand we would look at it again," he said.     Haughey said he regarded as "almost paramount" themaintenance of the punt's current position within the EuropeanMonetary System.    He criticized the attitude of the outgoing Irish governmentin recent EMS realignments -- the punt was devalued by eightpct last August.    "Until 1983, the policy of the Irish government was to wasto adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the EMS. Ibelieve that policy was right," Haughey said.                      Reuter&#3;
