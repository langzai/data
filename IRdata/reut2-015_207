Showboat Inc will take acharge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for thethird quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to thepresident J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses ofits recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casinoand Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarterand probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to thecontribution of the new Atlantic City facility.    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's thirdquarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the AtlanticCity hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interestexpenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facilitydirectly against income rather than capitalizing the interestas it had been able to do previously.    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter andgaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gamingwas completed earlier in the week. Reuter&#3;
