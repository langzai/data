The Ecuadorean economy, struck by anearthquake last month, will contract an estimated four pct in1987 and its crude oil output will drop by 42 pct, thegovernment's national development council (Conade) said.    A Conade report, dated April 21 and obtained, said that thecountry's gross domestic product (gdp) would fall by anestimated four pct compared to 1.5 pct growth last year. Conadefunctions as the country's main planning institution.    Crude output will fall to 61.2 mln barrels in 1987 from105.6 mln in 1986, Conade said. It forecast exports of 22.9 mlnof crude and derivatives against 63.3 mln last year.    The March five earthquake killed up to 1,000 people andcaused an estimated one billion dlrs in damage. It paralyzedEcuador's crude output because it ruptured the country's mainpipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of jungle oilfields, tothe Pacific Ocean port of Balao.    It will take until at least end-July to repair the line andreturn output to normal levels, oil officials said. Ecuadoroutput was about 250,000 barrels per day before the tremor.    Conade forecast total 1987 exports of 1.77 billion dlrs,572 mln dlrs of which would be oil and derivatives.    Imports were forecast at 1.70 billion dlrs. Total 1986exports were 2.18 billion dlrs, of which 979 mln dlrs werecrude and derivatives, with total imports 1.66 billion dlrs.    Conade predicted that payments on Ecuador's 8.16 billiondlrs foreign debt will be limited to 947 mln dlrs this yearagainst 1.489 billion dlrs last year. Conade's projectedceiling on payments is not legally binding.    The current account balance of payments deficit was seen at934 mln dlrs in 1987. It was 696 mln dlrs in 1986. Reuter&#3;
