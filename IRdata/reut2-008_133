Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defendedhis tax reform plans from fierce opposition, even within hisown party, as campaigning for local elections began.    "Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no meanswrong. Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound todecay, perhaps within the next 10 years," Nakasone toldsupporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwidevote since the LDP's general election victory last July.    Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining tofight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks inthe tax reform package, and are now challenging theLDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.    In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by theLDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support thesales tax as it stands.    A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just overthree weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they wouldtake the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement nextJanuary, into consideration when they vote.    Takako Doi, Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, saidin a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing thetax "The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Yourvote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it)."    The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate andwestern Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly withother parties in other prefectures.    A close aide to Nakasone, who asked not to be identified,said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the localelections since almost all candidates, irrespective of partyaffiliation, are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls.
