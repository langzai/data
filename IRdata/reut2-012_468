Officials at Toshiba &lt;TSBA.T> toldreporters they have developed a kind of wire which can conductelectricity with no resistance and therefore no loss of power.    Although other firms have developed such superconductivematerials, Toshiba scientists said their discovery is the firstthat allows the material to be formed into a pliable wire.    Developing a superconducting material that works at roomtemperature with no resistance is the object of a freneticworldwide scientific race. The main applications would be insuper powerful magnets, small computers of immense power andspeed, electric transmission lines which use negligible power,and electric generators which consume no power.    Toshiba said that it will probably be five years before itcan incorporate superconductors in marketable machines.    But problems still have to be surmounted. Presentsuperconductors, including Toshiba's, need to be cooled to verylow temperatures before they can pass electricity with noresistance. This requires costly liguid gas coolants.    Superconductors developed to date transmit only smallcurrents and cannot conduct alternating current, only directcurrent, government scientists said.    Toshiba, which spent 190.3 billion yen on research anddevelopment in the year ended March 31 1986, counts itselfamong the leading superconductor research companies in Japan,manager of Toshiba's public relations Yuji Wakayama said..    The wires the company uses are a blend of yttrium, bariumand copper oxide and can conduct with no resistance at minus179.5 degrees centigrade. REUTER&#3;
