The recent deterioration in thesteel market makes it important for Arbed SA &lt;ARBB.BR> tomaintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in astatement.    It reported that its competitive position had weakenedconsiderably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pctcut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mlntonnes.    Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit,slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks tolower raw material costs and prudent management, the companysaid.    Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the marketdeteriorate further, but the decision of the European Communityto maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally,should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.    EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota productionsystem while discussions continue on an industry plan forcapacity reductions.    Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting effortsremain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which havebeen built up over the last three years. REUTER&#3;
