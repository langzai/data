A split in the Thai government's maincoalition party may prompt Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda todissolve parliament soon, Interior Minister PrachuabSuntharangun said.    He told reporters that Prem was considering new electionsbecause squabbling in the Democrat Party undermined governmentperformance and held up legislation Prem wanted passed.    But Prem was reluctant to call new elections or reshufflehis cabinet because that too would be likely to result in awobbly multi-party coalition, Prachuab said. He declined to sayhow soon parliament might be dissolved.    The Democrats, one of four parties in the ruling coalition,have been split ever since winning 100 of the parliament's 347seats in elections in July 1986.    The current coalition was formed last August andconstitutes a hefty parliamentary majority. But the Democrats'inability to work well together or with their coalitionpartners has made the government vulnerable to the small butmore cohesive opposition.    Parliament closed the first of its two annual sessions thismonth and is scheduled to reconvene in September. REUTER&#3;
