Heck's Inc said it has filed forprotection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federalbankruptcy act.    The company said its wholly owned wholesale subsidiaries,its Maloney's subsidiary and its discount drug store operationare not included in the filing.    Heck's said it made the filing because its bank lendinggroup failed to renew on acceptable terms a credit agreementthat expired February 28.    It said the 12 banks provided about 50 mln dlrs in creditlines to Heck's, representing all its short-term borrowings.    Heck's said some of the banks have demanded repayment.    The company said another reason for the filing was adeveloping shortage in merchandise as suppliers reacted to thebreakdown in bank support.    Heck's said two representatives of the bank group, CharlesB. Gates Jr. and Walter B. Dial Jr., have left its board.    Heck's said it is exploring, with its investment banker,the possibility of selling all or parts of the company.    It said the filing will allow it to work out arrangementswith suppliers for the delivery of merchandise while permittingit to continue its previously-announced programs ofcost-cutting and the paring of operations.
