Laurence A. Tisch said CBS Inc is astronger company now than when he took control six months ago.    Tisch, in a speech before the National Association ofBroadcasters, said his cost-cutting efforts have made CBS a"better-managed company, with a stronger financial base, thatis better prepared to deal with the challenges of the future."    Tisch has been criticized for his aggressive attempts toslash CBS' costs, especially at the company's network newsdivision.    Earlier this month he ordered up to 200 jobs trimmed fromCBS News, which he hopes will save at least 30 mln dlrs.    In his speech, Tisch said, "While this has been anextremely painful period at CBS and particularly for theindividuals whose jobs have been eliminated, it has beennecessary to deal with the changing economics of our business."    He added, "We have had to establish a realistic coststructure and assert firm control over our expenses."    He said the cost cutting has not compromised the quality ofCBS programming or the creativity and professionalism of itsstaff.    Tisch also said he remains "firmly committed to ensuringthat our crown jewel - the CBS News Division - maintains itsposition as the premier source of television news in America." Reuter&#3;
