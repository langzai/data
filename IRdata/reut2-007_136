The U.S. Agriculture Department isproposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits oninsect infestations in grain shipments.    The changes in the standards would include the following:    -- Establishing equal tolerances for the number of liveinsects in shipments of food grains, feed grains and oilseeds.    -- Revising the definition of "infested" to give equal valueto all insects injurious to grain.    -- Establishing lower levels of infestations. In 1988, theinfested level would be set at three or more live insects perrepresentative sample (about 100 grams), in 1990 two or moreinsects, and in 1992 the final infestattion level would be setat one or more live insects per representative sample.    -- Revising the definition of sample grade by adding alimit of 10 live or dead insects per sample.    -- Revising the definition of sample grade for wheat byadding a limit of 32 insect-damaged kernels per 100 grams ofwheat.    The department asked for public comments on the proposalsby April 17. Reuter&#3;
