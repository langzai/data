Federal Reserve Board Vice ChairmanManuel Johnson said that some U.S. banks have been too rigid intalks with lesser developed countries on debt refinancings andwarned that a breakdown of the renegotiation process could beharmful.    "There have been some difficulties in those negotiations ...banks have sometimes been too rigid," Johnson said in responseto a question during an address before the Eastern EconomicAssociation, an academic group.    "I think there have been potential breakdowns in thatprocess," he said, adding that an actual breakdown "would be veryunfortunate."    He declined to comment on the situation of specific nationsand said it was not the Fed's role to become involved in suchtalks.    However, he said it was "always a little bit risky" for aheavily indebted nation to seek refinancing without firstnegotiating with the International Monetary Fund on economicreforms. He added that he remains optimistic that current talkswould be resolved successfully. Reuter&#3;
