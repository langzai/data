House Speaker Jim Wright predictedpassage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration toprovide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, buta last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals andconservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.    The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision toprotect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags-- effectively making them American ships.    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,and some charged the policy could lead the United States intothe 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by theDemocratic and Republican congressional leadership and theadministration -- which demanded a report within seven days onplans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.    The resolution was expected to pass without controversytoday in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the fullHouse was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberalDemocrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joinedin an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.    Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in thebill implied consent to Reagan's policies. Reuter&#3;
