First Interstate Bank Corp spentabout 3.5 mln dlrs on its attempted takeover of BankAmericaCorp, First Interstate Chairman Joseph Pinola said.    In response to a shareholder's question following thecompany's annual meeting, Pinola also said that figure couldultimately be lower depending on the outcome of negotiationswith the firm's insurers.    Pinola explained that the company's insurance rates went up"substantially" after last year's attempt to acquire BankAmericaCorp.    In February, First Interstate withdrew its 3.20 bln dlr bidfor BankAmerica and said it was no longer interested in theacquisition because of BankAmerica's divestitures.    During the takeover battle, BankAmerica sold its Italianbanking operations and its profitable Charles Schwab and Codiscount brokerage firm. Reuter&#3;
