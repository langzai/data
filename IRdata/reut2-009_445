Combustion Engineering Inc saidit expects first quarter earnings to be 20 to 25 pct below theyear-ago 13.6 mln dlrs, mainly due to financing costs resultingfrom the January 1987 acquisition of AccuRay Corp.    The company said it has filed for an offering of four mlncommon shares and 150 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due2017, with proceeds to be used to refinance the short-term bankdebt incurred for the AccuRay acquisition, to finance othercosts of the transaction and for general corporate purposes.    Combustion said 3,500,000 shares will be sold in the U.S.and the remainder overseas.    Combustion paid about 218 mln dlrs for AccuRay, a maker ofcomputer-based measurement and control systems used in pulp andpaper mills.    The company said it expects to release first quarterresults in the third week in April.    Combustion said it expects further restructuring of corebusinesses -- particularly Lummus Crest -- this year throughstaff reductions downsizings and the consolidation offacilities.    Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest isexpected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this yearlosses in the Engineering and Construction segment.    But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to beapproximately offset by a number of factors, including asomewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generationsegment than in 1986, financing costs of the AccuRayacquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRaytechnology and operations and delays in waste to energyprojects.
