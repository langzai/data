French Prime Minister Jacques Chiracsaid that on financial issues, the United States and France had"very close" views, and he said Treasury Secretary James Bakerwas determined to support the February 22 Paris agreement onstabilizing foreign exchange parities.    "I was very reassured by the determination of Mr. Baker tosupport this agreement," he said.    He described the dollar's sharp fall against the yen at thestart of the week as a "passing incident" and added, "Everyone isresolved to support the Paris accord."    Questioned about his plan to help the world's poorestcountries, Chirac said he did not envisage any large-scale debtwrite-offs.    "I don't think we can talk of write-offs - even the poorestcountries have not asked for that," he said.    Chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third worldcountries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for theInternational Monetary Fund to soften its conditions.    "One cannot pity the banks - they bear a lot ofresponsibility due to the encouragement they gave to thesecountries to take on debts. Now the banks are complaining but Ido not weep for them."
