The Finance Ministry plans to examine howlife insurance companies realised capital gains throughtransactions undertaken in June, just before the yen bondmarket began to fall sharply, a senior Ministry official said.    The move is aimed at cooling fierce competition in thefield and will pave the way for a Ministry system to check thatinsurers do not inflate investment returns on the accounts toattract investors, he said.    Some insurers transfer part of their unrealised gains fromgeneral accounts to the variable life accounts, violating theirinternal regulations, industry sources said.    The eight major local life-insurers which offer variablelife policies here realised an average return of 21.01 pct onsuch policies in the year ended September.    The Ministry will scrutinise the policies of 17 local andforeign life insurers which offer the variable life schemes.    Japan has 23 major local life insurers, none of which islisted on the stock market.  REUTER&#3;
