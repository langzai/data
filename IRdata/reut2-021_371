U.S. warships attacked and destroyedan Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday'sIranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. DefenseSecretary Caspar Weinberger said.    When asked how much was left of the oil platform,Weinberger said, "Nothing."    "There was no Iranian reaction," he said. "... We considerthis matter is now closed."    Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platformabout 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fireat 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.    "We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere withand be a source of potential attack on convoys...," Weinbergersaid at a Pentagon briefing.     "We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch smallboat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...    "It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety ofU.S. forces in the future," Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy'soperation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we willbe prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iranwith stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.    He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platformwere given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.    "As far as we know they did abandon the site," he said.    Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen toattack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missileplatforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack. Reuter&#3;
