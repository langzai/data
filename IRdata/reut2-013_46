Britain's Export Credits GuaranteeDepartment (ECGD) is holding talks with Nigeria aimed atresuming insurance cover for British exporters to Nigeria, thehead of ECGD's international debt division, Gerry Breach, said.    The ECGD suspended cover on Nigeria in 1984 after thecountry fell into arrears on payments of insured and uninsureddebts.    Following last week's bilateral accord between Britain andNigeria to reschedule the country's insured trade debts,bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption ofcover.    Breach told a businessmen's meeting that for the ECGD toconsider "a gradual introduction of a package of new support"certain criteria would have to be met.    This would involve the Nigerian economic structuraladjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed bythe International Monetary Fund, the program remaining oncourse and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and asatisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government ofthe ECGD insured short-term trade arrears.    British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986. Reuter&#3;
