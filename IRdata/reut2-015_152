Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie saidthe province is prepared to offer money to help re-open(Noranda Inc)'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down byfire last week, but said he could not give a specific figureuntil damage estimates have been completed.    Federal member of parliament for the region, Charles-EugeneMarin, said last week the federal government is also preparedto provide financial help to restart operations as soon aspossible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a morespecific estimate by the end of the month.    Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, buthas found that it will take longer than expected to gain accessto the burned-out area.    Noranda said the mine was not insured.    "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring allof Noranda's underground operations would have beenprohibitive," Larry Taylor, Noranda's risk management andinsurance director, said.    Taylor said before last week's fire, the company had onlyhad one previous mine accident many years ago.    Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 otherunderground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to havestarted on a new conveyor system.    Noranda has said it would take four to five months toreturn the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said. Reuter&#3;
