One of two rival firms seeking to enterJapan's international telecommunications market said it willoffer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms.    President of &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ), NobuoIto, decline to specify what share the firms would take, buttold Reuters they would not participate in its management.    ITJ and &lt;International Digital Communications Planning Inc>(IDC), in which both Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> andPacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> own 20 pct stakes, are set tomerge into a new entity to compete against &lt;Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co Ltd> (KDD).    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has urged thetwo rival firms to merge so KDD would have only a singlecompetitor. The ministry has also rejected foreign management.    Japan's law limits foreign ownership of any newinternational telecommunications entrant to 33 pct, so C andW's and Pacific's stakes could be three pct in the merged firm,sources said. Those seeking to join are General Electric Co&lt;GE.N>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F.N>, &lt;Citibank NA>, BankAmerica Corp&lt;BAC.NYSE>, &lt;Shearson Lehman Bros Inc>, &lt;Saloman Brothers>,&lt;Asia Boeing Computer Service>, Unisys Corp &lt;UIS.N>, &lt;SocieteGenerale> and Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.FRA>.    The merger plan has been criticised for excluding foreignfirms from a meaningful position in the market.    The U.K.'s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, U.S. Secretaryof State George Shultz, U.S. Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have allexpressed such opposition.    Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will draft areply to the criticism following further discussion, a Postsand Ministry official said. REUTER&#3;
