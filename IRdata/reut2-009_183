Considerable uncertainty surrounds theoutcome of today's EC white sugar tender, traders here said,noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats tomove over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.    They said that due to the dispute between the Commissionand producers over the issue, it is not clear whether theCommission will authorise any exports at all or grant licenceson a large tonnage.    The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a preciselevel after prices fell yesterday.    Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commissionto award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar witha maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus.    Last week, the Commission granted licences to end August on60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819. REUTER&#3;
