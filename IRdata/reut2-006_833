U.S. Agriculture UndersecretaryDaniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demandsituation has become more bullish recently because ofdevelopments in the world market and increased consumption.    Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriationssubcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improvedthe wheat outlook.    He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are alsoreports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantingshave been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports ofgreater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.    "It seems reasonable to expect production and consumptionto be in far better balance than a year ago," Amstutz said. Reuter&#3;
