This is mainly because Raffinerie Tirlemontoise is in therelatively static sugar market, they added. The Glaverbel issueof 755,000 shares at 1,850 francs each was more than 100 timesoversubscribed and analysts said this showed that there will beno lack of liquidity for the sugar refiner's offer.     He declined to say at what price the new shares will beoffered when they are floated between May 5 and 15, sayingBelgium's Banking Commission has yet to approve arrangements.    However, analysts said local press speculation that theprice would be between 1,500 and 1,800 francs appeared not toofar from the mark.    Although the bourse saw some selling recently because ofinternational factors, the key Belgian cash market index closedyesterday at 4,436.05 against 3,582.17 a year ago, a rise whichhas been fuelled in part by increasing international interest.REUTER&#3;
