The entire House AgricultureSubcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry has written U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter a letter urging the Reaganadministration to block a European Community, EC, plan totighten meat inspection requirements.    The letter signed by the 16 panel members said the EC planto require U.S. meat processing plants to comply with ECstandards would "impose an unnecessary and unfair hardship onthe U.S. meat industry."    The EC plan is set to go into effect April 30.    "It would be inconceivable that we would allow the ECcontinued access to the U.S. market while they attempt to haltour meat exports to the EC," the March 9 letter said. Reuter&#3;
