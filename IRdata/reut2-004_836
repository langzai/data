Cyclops Corp said its board rejecteda request by Cyacq Corp, an investor group, for more non-publicinformation about Cyclops, a maker of specialty steels and anelectronics retailer.    Cyclops cited its agreement to be acquired by Britain'sDixons Group PLC for 90.25 dlrs a share under a tender offerthat expires midnight March 17.    Cyacq, comprising Audio/Video Affiliates Inc, CiticorpCapital Investors Ltd and other investors, yesterday said itwould increase its tender offer for Cyclops to 92.50 dlrs ashare from 80 dlrs, subject to certain conditions.    The conditions were that Cyclops provide Cyacq withnon-public data given to Dixons and that Cyacq be satisfiedwith financial projections made by Dixons in its offer.    Cyclops also said its board determined that Cyacq'sannouncement was not an offer. "Cyacq's press release does notamend Cyacq's outstanding tender offer which remains at 80 dlrsper share and it does not state that Cyacq has financingcommitments necessary to carry out its original offer or anyincreased offer that it may make," Cyclops said in a statement.    Its agreements with Dixons are binding and Dixons indicatedit will not rescind or waive any provisions of the pacts,Cyclops said.    The company also said it was advised that Dixons'shareholders approved the merger, satisfying that condition ofthe agreement. Reuter&#3;
