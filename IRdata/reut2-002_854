The U.S. Department of Transportation(DOT) said it dismissed on technical grounds an application byTrans World Airlines Inc for DOT approval for it to takecontrol of USAir Group.    The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when itcould put together an application for control that met theagency's procedural requirements.    The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justicedisclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.    It was not immediately clear what impact the denial wouldhave on TWA's bid to take over USAir.    In its control application, TWA had acknowledged thatadditional documentation was required to meet DOT rules andsaid it would file more material on the morning of March 9.    But the DOT said it would not wait.    "We have determined to dismiss TWA's application forapproval of the acquisition of USAir," it said in an orderissued late Friday.    "TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filingrequirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided noreason why we should accept such a deficient filing," it added.    "Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, ofcourse, may refile it when it is able to comply with ourprocedural rules," the DOT said.    The agency added that it would continue to consider aseparate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAirstock through a voting trust.    USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT todismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filingdid not meet DOT requirements. Reuter&#3;
