Portugal's minority centre-rightgovernment, which faces a crucial censure vote in parliament onFriday, unveiled an eight-year economic plan aimed at reducingforeign debt and boosting jobs and investment.    Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva told reporters the planwas a blueprint for modernisation focusing on cuttingPortugal's 9.6 pct unemployment, or 400,000 people.    The program was approved at a cabinet meeting of the16-month-old Social Democratic Party (PSD) government.    The censure motion has been proposed by a centre-left partywhich says the government has failed to tackle economic ills.    Left-wing opposition parties, who together hold a majorityin parliament, have indicated they intend to vote against theminority government, which would automatically fall ifdefeated.    A first phase of the government plan foresees annual growthin investment of between eight and 10 pct over the next fouryears. Government figures show investment grew 10 pct last yearcompared with a fall of three pct in 1985.    The plan foresees this leading to creation of 32,000 newjobs a year.    The program also foresees government spending cuts,particularly in the public sector, reducing the state budgetdeficit to around five pct of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in1990 from nearly 11 pct in 1986.    Portugal's foreign debt, which totals more than 16 billiondlrs, was forecast to be reduced to the equivalent of 24 pct ofGDP in 1990 from around 55 pct at end-1986.    Detailed forecasts were not released for beyond 1990. REUTER&#3;
