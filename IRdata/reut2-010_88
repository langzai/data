Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker said he opposes legislation to deny primary dealerstatus to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firmsequal access to their government debt markets.    In a letter to House Banking Committee chairman Fernand St.Germain, Volcker warned that it could lead to retaliationagainst U.S. firms already operating in other countries.    The committee approved the legislation yesterday. They saidits impact would be felt only by Japanese firms designated asprimary dealers in U.S. government securities since othercountries would meet the equal access rule.    "Even Japan, at which the proposal seems to be particularlyaimed, has made a number of advances in opening its market toU.S. firms," Volcker said.    The legislation gives the administration six months tonegotiate equal access for U.S. firms in the foreign governmentsecurities markets before the ban on foreign dealers in theU.S. would take effect.    Volcker said more progress could be made by continuingnegotiations without adopting the bill's more rigid approach.    An aide to Rep. Charles Schumer, the New York Democraticsponsor, said it is expected to pass in the House trade bill. Reuter&#3;
