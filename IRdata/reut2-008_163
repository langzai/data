French 1987 growth will probably be abouttwo pct, the same as last year, due to an internationalenvironment that is less favourable than expected, FinanceMinister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying.    Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that grossdomestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pctthis year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.    Although in line with the latest Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth,the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments andexports, Balladur said in an interview with the daily LesEchos.    Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just twopct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pctand 1.1 pct growth in 1985.    He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficitto 115 billion francs from this year's figure of 129 billionand compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985.    He has already announced his intention of cutting thedeficit to 100 billion francs in 1989. REUTER&#3;
