The Paris-based Intergovernmental Councilof Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying thecurrent backwardation in world copper market prices but doesnot envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sourceshere said.    The organisation's executive and marketing committeesreviewed the current market situation during a series ofmeetings here late last week, but took no major decisions.    The sources noted that the backwardation - premium ofnearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeksand is the longest on record.   "It's unusual," one official said, but added CIPEC did nothave any immediate recipe to remedy the situation.    The meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors ofCIPEC's regional copper development and promotion centres,which are based in Europe, Japan, India and Brazil.    Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annualministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire inlate September.    The last three ministerial meetings have been held in Paristo keep down costs. Reuter&#3;
