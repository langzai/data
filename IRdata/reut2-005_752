The Agriculture Ministry is expected toreduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not beenset yet, industry sources said.    Production prices, the basis for setting interventionprices, have been falling because of declining compound feedprices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said.    Last November an advisory panel urged the government towork on reducing officially set high farm product prices tolevels closer to international values, the sources added.    In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisationzone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers.    The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-governmentLivestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stockoperation in the wholesale market.    The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will beset by the end of March after an advisory panel to theAgriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting onMarch 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard orbottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said.    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced fromdairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540yen per kilo and the ceiling 760.    They said the domestic beef intervention price influencesimported beef selling prices on the domestic market.    Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-governmentbody imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers orprocessors in line with the standard price of other beefcategories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beefprices, they said.
