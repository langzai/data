The USDA monthly cold storage reportfor meats is expected to have little, if any, effect onlivestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile ExchangeMonday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk ofdirection, livestock analysts said.    The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals mayprovide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.    "I think the market is going to be looking at some otherthings and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets mightbe early next week," Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GHMiller, said.    Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futureswill be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hogmarketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business wascompleted this week and there may be less aggressive interestfor pork in general next week.    "We needed some help from the cold storage report to averta possible setback next week in the pork complex," Levitt said.    Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the bellyfigure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks weredown 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the averageexpectation and actually showed a lighter than expected declinefrom last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings,they said.    However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put instorage has been light since the beginning of March and this isa potentially bullish situation.    Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri,said, "I would not look for (belly) storage during the nextmonth or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will beless." Reuter&#3;
