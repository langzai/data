Japanese private sector investment inplant and equipment is expected to grow a real 0.9 pct in 1987,after an estimated 5.5 pct rise last year, the Long-Term CreditBank of Japan Ltd said.    It said its survey of 1,169 companies at the end ofFebruary showed that manufacturing industry investment willdecline eight pct this year, while non-manufacturing willincrease 5.7 pct. It did not provide figures for 1986.    The bank partly blamed the expected deline in manufacturinginvestment on the uncertain outlook for demand in thoseindustries.    The Long-Term Credit Bank also said that steelmaking andshipbuilding companies are putting a squeeze on maintenance andrepair costs for their facilities and equipment.    In non-manufacturing industry, growth in investment isexpected to be particularly marked in the wholesale and retailstore area, 12.4 pct, as new department stores and supermarketsare built and old ones are remodelled.    The Bank though expressed concern at a slowing of corporateinvestment that would help restructure the Japanese economy andurged government deregulation and other action to offset this. REUTER&#3;
