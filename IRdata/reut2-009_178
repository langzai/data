Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, theinternational trading group, said its 1986 domestic group netprofit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that theprofit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.    The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted adomestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mlnmark write-back of reserves that had been created to coverpossible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessarybecause of recent declines in raw material prices.    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall inprices as well as the lower value of the dollar.    It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinaryshare capital, which is entirely in private hands and heldlargely by family foundations.    Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participationcertificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yieldof around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to aquarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the companyadded. REUTER&#3;
