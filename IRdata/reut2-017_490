The Zambian government today announcedminor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its neweconomic strategy, while police and troops patrolled thenorthern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,were not affected by the cuts and many people said this couldprovoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected moresweeping reductions.    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with thesmall extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct onitems such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone saidgovernment forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no signof troops or police reinforcements on the streets.    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to takeaccount of lower import costs following the revaluation of thekwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economicstrategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerityprogram.    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs ofunemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatileregion to take action against shops that did not reduce theirprices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed inthe Copperbelt during food riots last December after thegovernment tried to lift maize subsidies. Reuter&#3;
