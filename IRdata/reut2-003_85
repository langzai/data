The Supreme Court declined to hear anappeal by U.S. West Inc &lt;USW> challenging whether a consentdecree was legally binding on the seven regional telephonefirms created by the breakup of American Telephone andTelegraph Co &lt;T>.    The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by a U.S.Court of Appeals last August that the restrictions of the 1982decree were legally binding on the regional companies, eventhough they were not parties to it.    U.S. West, one of the seven regional companies, argued thatthe restrictions violated the constitutional protections of dueprocess under the law because AT and T did not adequatelyrepresent its subsidiaries during the consent decreeproceedings.    The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to rejectthe appeal, saying, "As a parent corporation, AT and T had thelegal authority to bind (its operating subsidiaries) in aconsent decree."    Also opposing the appeal was AT and T.    The appeals court ruling also allowed the Bell operatingcompanies to offer certain services outside their territorywithout express permission of the federal courts.    That part of the ruling was not appealed to the SupremeCourt.    Justice Antonin Scalia did not take part in today's ruling,and the court gave no explanation. Reuter&#3;
