Strandard and Poor's Corp said it cut toCCC-plus from B-minus Coleco Industries Inc's 300 mln dlrs ofsubordinated debt.    The company's implied senior debt rating is B.    S/P said the action reflected significant deterioration incapital structure and financial flexibility following Coleco's111 mln dlr net loss in fiscal 1986. The agency attributed theloss to a falloff in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls.    Coleco had negative equity of 7.7 mln dlrs at year-end1986, S/P noted. Future operating performance depends onseveral new products with untested earnings potential. Reuter&#3;
