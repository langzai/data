Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale desUsines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeksthe period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler'sproposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.    The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault onMarch nine set April nine as the target date for completingnegotiations.    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension ofthat date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.    The two companies said they "now plan to complete work byApril 23."    Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of thedeal, the need for additional time was to be expected."    The March letter of intent between the two companies saysthat Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discoversan unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problemhad cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company'sstatement that more time was needed because the talks arecomplex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine orwhen an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendendby a written agreement by both companies.    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working towarda definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who isnot part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were introuble: "There are no glitches."    Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. "Ican't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done," saidDonaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson. Reuter&#3;
