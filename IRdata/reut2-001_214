Fertility and Genetics Research Inc saidit will not establish further free-standing ovum transfercenters and is exploring the establishment of general fertilitycenters and alternative businesses.    The company said this followed its evaluation ofunpublished technical information regarding some competingtechnology which, if substantiated and replicated, couldadversely affect the company's operations.    Fertility and Genetics said the non-surgical ovum transferprocedure will continue to remain a viable option for infertilecouples to consider among the several alternative proceduresavailable in advanced reproductive medicine.    "In particular, it is medically and psychologicallysuperior to surrogate motherhood, because the fertilized egg istransferred prior to the gestation process, rather than aftermaternal bonding with the child has taken place," the companyexplained without further reference to the unpublishedtechnical information.
