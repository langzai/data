Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat commercial banks need to develop more flexibility in theirconcerted lending mechanisms "to help assure continuedparticipation in new money packages."    He said that major debtor nations need to be able to counton receiving timely disbursements on new loans essential tosupport well-conceived economic programs.    His remarks were made to the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee.    Baker said, "The sense of urgency and willingness tocooperate in support of a larger general interest that helpedto carry us through the difficult crisis period of 1982 and1983 is now less evident."    He said to address this problem, it is important for thecommercial banks to "develop a menu of alternative new money options from which all banks with debt exposure can choose inproviding continuing support for debtor reforms."    He said the "continued implementation of the debt strategymay well rest on their doing so."    Baker also said that growth prospects for the lowest incomecountries remain an issue of "critical concern to the UnitedStates."    He said that he intended to address the problem of poorcountry prospects in greater detail at tomorrow's meeting ofthe joint IMF-World Bank Devlopment Committee.    Baker said, however, that ministers should guard againstwhat appear to be magical solutions to the complex debtproblem.    "I want to stress the need for all to guard against theephemeral attraction of magical solutions, which may appear astantalizing alternatives to the rigorous realities of grapplingwith our debt problems," he said.    But he emphasized that the only lasting progress is toapproach each situation on a case-by-case basis, "bringing tobear the policies and financing needed to bring the economyback to sustained economic growth."
