A 0.4 pct rise in the March U.S. indexof leading indicators points to continued moderate U.S. realeconomic growth, economists said.    "The report is consistent with a modestly growing economy,"said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. "Theeconomy is not robust, but we're not heading into a recessioneither."    "The report suggests more of the same: continued moderategrowth," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Government and CoInc. "The gain was mostly in stock prices. There was no changein the fundamental movement of the economy."    The Commerce Department said that higher stock prices ledthe March gain. Unemployment claims, vendor performance,contracts and orders for plant and equipment, manufacturers'orders, and building permits also were positive.    The average workweek, raw materials prices, and moneysupply detracted from the index.    Economists noted that the index signals the direction butnot the magnitude of changes in gross national product.    "You can't derive profound conclusions on the economy fromthe report," McCarthy said. "The link between leadingindicators and the economy is not strong." Reuter&#3;
