U.S. Comptroller of the CurrencyRobert Clarke said his office is expanding a plan givingtemporarily ailing but well managed national banks extra timeto come into compliance with its minimum capital requirements.    The policy, which originally was intended to give well runbanks in economically depressed areas more time to rebuilddepleted capital levels, will be broadened to apply to allnational banks, Clarke said in a speech to a financial seminar.A text of his remarks was made public today.    The comptroller's office will extend the applicationdeadline for the plan to Dec. 31, 1989 from Dec. 31, 1987.    It will extend to 1995 from 1993 the deadline for banks toboost their capital levels to the required minimum level.    Finally, it will eliminate a current requirement that abank have capital of at least four pct to participate in thecapital forbearance plan.    "In theory, a bank could be allowed to continue to operatewith nearly zero capital if we approve its plan to rebuild itscapital base," Clarke said, though he added that a bank in thatsituation would have a have "a virtually ironclad plan for aprompt restoration of capital" to be accepted.    The critical linkage to forbearance is that thefundamentals must be in place to assure that the bank cansurvive: in short, capable management and financial prospects,"Clarke said.    He said the program will continue to be closed to insolventbanks. Reuter&#3;
