AMR Corp chairman Robert Crandall,denying industry speculation, said the company is notinterested in acquiring shuttle routes in the northeast regionof the U.S. from Pan Am Corp.    But in remarks at a press conference announcing a majoraircraft order, he said AMR would be interested in certainother Pan Am assets. But he noted that none had been madeavailable.    Pan Am earlier today announced an order for 40 new aircraftfrom Boeing Co &lt;BA> and &lt;Airbus Industrie>, a Europeanconsortium, for an estimated 2.5 billion dlrs.    AMR, the parent of American Airlines, has said it is notinterested in acquiring Pan Am as a whole and Crandallreiterated that position today.    "Assets are one thing, and companies are another," Crandallsaid, referring to the possibility of acquiring assets from PanAm.    He said Pan Am has not offered its transatlantic routes forsale, adding that it would not make much sense for them to doso.  Reuter&#3;
