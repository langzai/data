Leading cocoa producers will discusswhether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa bufferstock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world priceswhen they start four day's of talks here later today,conference sources said.

The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss thescheme at a meeting in June, and exporters could use theYaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue, thesources said.    Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for aninternational cocoa research conference due to take place inSanto Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month, CPAsecretary general D.S.
