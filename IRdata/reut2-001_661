Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviriablamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of lastweek's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on exportquotas.    "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexiblethan the one of Brazil, where current economic and politicalfactors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviriatold Reuters in an interview.    The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the otherfor the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce exportquotas after being extended through the weekend in London.    Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successfuloutcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigentattitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made itimpossible.    In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviriasaid the U.S. attitude would have serious economic andpolitical consequences, not necessarily for a country likeColombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and forsome African countries.    He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relativelyhigh level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.    According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, whichtraditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total exportrevenue.    That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400mln dlrs from 1986.    Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at thestart of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mlnbags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30. Reuter&#3;
