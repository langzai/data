MacMillan BloedelLtd's share price rose 4-1/2 dlrs to 79-1/4 after climbing byas much as 5-1/4 dlrs in trading earlier on the Toronto StockExchange.    Company officials were not immediately available to commenton the steep gain.    Forestry analyst Rick Sales at Vancouver, BritishColumbia-based Odlum Brown Ltd said the strength partlyreflected the buoyant forest products industry, the company'sproposed three-for-one stock split and strong 1987 earningsprospects.    He predicted MacMillan Bloedel would earn eight dlrs ashare this year. The company's 1986 net profit after a 1.45 dlrextraordinary gain rose to 4.66 dlrs a share from 54 cts ashare in 1985 due to lower costs and stronger markets.    Sales added that investors might also be expecting "a majordividend increase." The company paid 75 cts a share in regularcommon stock dividends last year.    MacMillan Bloedel's 49 pct-owner &lt;Noranda Inc> "needs cashand they do have people on (MacMillan's) board of directors,"said Sales.    Noranda said earlier this week it planned a public shareoffer in its Noranda Forest Inc unit, which holds Noranda'sstake in MacMillan Bloedel.    Sales discounted previous speculation that Noranda mighttry to sell its stake in MacMillan.    Noranda would rather probably like to raise its stake,Sales said, although he added such a move could meet oppositionfrom the British Columbia government, which limitedToronto-based Noranda to a minority stake in its 1981 takeoverbid for MacMillan Bloedel.
