President Reagan said the UnitedStates would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missilereductions at talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva tomorrow.    Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in theWhite House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador MaxKampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home forconsultations later this week. He said they will then return toGeneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact.    Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturdayto proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces(INF) separate from strategic and space weapons, Reagan said:"This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INFreductions."    "To seize this new opportunity I have instructed ournegotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty textat Geneva tomoorrow," Reagan said.    He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining tobe resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Sovietmissiles, "none is more important than verification ... Anyagreement must be effectively verifiable."    The United States has been working closely with allies andfriends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty onreducing these weapons with an eye to their eventualelimination, the president said.     He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreedupon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October inReykjavik, Iceland, which was shelved when the Soviet leaderinsisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement onlong-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.    "I remain firmly committed to these objectives," he said.    He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkageof the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier toagreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at theearlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985.
