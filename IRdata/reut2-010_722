European Community agricultureministers are today taking their first serious look at farmprice proposals for the coming season, but diplomats expect noagreement at the two days of talks.    Experts say the proposals put forward last month by theEuropean Commission could lead to a double-digit percentagefall in guaranteed prices for the 1987/88 crop year.    Consideration of the price measures comes as farm surplusesand subsidies are set to dominate forthcoming talks under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.    The talks signal the official start of months of annualwrangling over subsidy levels paid to the EC's 12 mln farmers.    Agriculture worldwide is plagued by surplus production anddepressed prices, with domestic economic policies largelyblamed for the crisis. The U.S. Has signaled it wants the issueof world over-supply pushed to the top of the list ofinternational economic issues to be negotiated this year.    EC diplomats say that to a large extent this view is sharedin Europe, but the political strength of well-organised farmlobbies leaves ministers with little room for manoeuvre. Reuter&#3;
