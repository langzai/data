Cominco Ltd said itexpects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers ofAmerica locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley,B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.    It had no meeting scheduled with the other three strikinglocals, which rejected a tentative three-year contractSaturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost ofliving increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, butno wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.    The three locals represent about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about600 office and technical workers.    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since thestrike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare forcemajeure, which means the company may be unable to honorcontracts for products from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.    The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.    Trail smelter revenue was 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986. Reuter&#3;
