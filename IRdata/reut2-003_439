Lending by the World Bank and its softloan arm, the International Development Agency (IDA), to Chinais expected to almost double to about two billion dlrs by1989/90 from the levels of 1984 to 1986, foreign bankers toldReuters.    They said approved lending in 1986/87 (July-June) isexpected to total 1.4 billion dlrs, of which 550 mln will comefrom the IDA and 850 mln from the World Bank.    World Bank figures show approved lending to China by thetwo bodies amounted to 1.137 billion in 1985/86, 1.102 billionin 1984/85 and 1.04 billion in 1983/84.    The bankers said that 1.2 billion dlrs had been disbursedby the end of 1986 and China's disbursement record comparesvery favourably with that of other countries.    They said Japan has so far been the main source ofbilateral concessional assistance for China, followed by WestGermany, Canada, Italy, Australia and Britain.    But China will probably find that such funds will notincrease, except for those from Japan and the World Bank, givenother claims, particularly from sub-Saharan African countrieswhich cannot raise commercial credits, they added.
