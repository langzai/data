Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> turnover in theUnited States will rise to about 2.6 billion dlrs in thecurrent year to end September from 2.2 billion in 1985/86,management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.    He told the annual meeting 80 pct of last year's sales camefrom products made in the U.S.. He added Siemens was asinterested as U.S. Authorities in reducing the massive tradedeficit and calming down trade relations.    "But we would show no understanding if this (trade deficitreduction) was attempted through means incompatible with theprinciple of free world trade," Kaske said.    Siemens has been the subject of pressure by U.S.Telecommunications authorities to limit its access to the U.S.Market for digital telephone switching equipment.    The Federal Communications Commission announced in Decemberit was starting an enquiry into the blocking of free access tothe telecommunications market by foreign firms, with officerssaying reciprocal access was not available to U.S. Firmsabroad.    For years Siemens was the only supplier of public switchingstations to the Bundespost, the German federal post office.Regulatory authorities in 1982 opened Bundespost contracts totenders from other domestic and foreign suppliers.    But foreign authorities have complained that too manyrestrictions to overseas suppliers still remain.    Kaske said neither Siemens nor the Bundespost could be heldresponsible for the U.S. Trade deficit and noted the U.S. Wasstill achieving substantial surpluses in trade with WestGermany in the electrical and telecommunications sector.    The Bundespost is far more open to supplies from abroadthan telephone companies in the U.S. Japan or France, he added. Reuter&#3;
