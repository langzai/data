House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Congress would morereadily respond to the needs of the U.S. futures industry to beinternationally competitive if the industry showed awillingness to do its business honestly.    Rostenkowski told the Futures Industry Association that ifother countries were relaxing futures regulations "because oursare being tightened, so that they can take a competitiveadvantage, I think we (Congress) have a responsibility to keepyou out in front."    But he told the futures leaders that they "have a moreimportant reponsibility to do your business honestly. You can'tignore the trader who is improperly using his opportunity." Reuter&#3;
