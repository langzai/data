Charges of public sector waste,corruption and neglect of agriculture have surfaced amid thecompliments in debates at the annual session of China'sparliament, the National People's Congress (NPC).    China's top entrepreneur Rong Yiren, chairman of the ChinaInternational Investment and Trust Corporation (CITIC), whoalso represents Shanghai in the NPC, attacked the "profit beforeeverything" mentality which he said led to theft, embezzlementand extravagant gifts and banquets.    Public criticism of policy is rare in China.    The New China News Agency quoted comments by NPC members onPremier Zhao Ziyang's draft work program for the year ahead.    The rural lobby was active. Deputies from three provincessaid Zhao was not forceful enough in tackling their problems.One said the state had cut spending on agriculture from 11 pctof total capital investment in 1979 to three or four pct today."This is incompatible with the important place occupied byagriculture," he said.    Other deputies said the state had broken promises toimprove fertiliser, oil and seed supplies to their provinces.    Although another congress member was quoted by the agencyas saying Zhao's opening speech last week was "discreet,appropriate, comprehensive and assuring," others said thegovernment had spent too much or too little. One member saidpeople were worried about the state's budget deficit, projectedat more than two billion dlrs this year. Reuter&#3;
