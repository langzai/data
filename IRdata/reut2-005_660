Ashland Oil Inc said it expects toreport a loss from operations in the second quarter.    The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrsnet gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to paydown debt. "However, it is difficult to determine now whetherthis gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operatingloss," the company said in a statement. A company spokesmanwould not elaborate.    The company's Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a lossin January and February since it was unable to raise productprices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, Ashland said.    Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica, a retailmarketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, thecompany's Valvoline, Ashland Chemical and coal businesses areexpected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31.    In the year-ago quarter, Ashland had income from operationsof 93.8 mln dlrs before corporate and interest expenses, taxes,equity income and other items.    Net income in the quarter was 39.4 mln dlrs or 1.12 dlrs ashare on sales of 1.78 billion dlrs. Reuter&#3;
