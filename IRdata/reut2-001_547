The world trade body GATT has decided toset up an arbitration panel to rule on objections by Canada andthe European Community to a customs user fee imposed by theU.S. Government, a GATT spokesman said.    Canada and the EC told a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade) council meeting that the fee, which imposes a tax onan ad valorem basis on imports as of December 1, 1986, isillegal under GATT rules.    U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels said the fee, imposed bythe U.S. To help cover customs expenditure as part of theConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, doesnot breach GATT rules and is similar to fees charged by manyother countries.    Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examinethe dispute, instead of a panel empowered to rule on it.    In another development, Hong Kong, supported by a largenumber of developing countries, attacked the "textile andapparel trade act of 1987" introduced in the U.S. Congress lastFebruary 19.    Hong Kong representative Michael Cartland said the bill is"blatantly protectionist." He added there is "almost nothing aboutthe bill which could be regarded as in any way consistent witheither the GATT or the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)."    If the bill were to be passed by Congress, Cartland said "itwould forestall any attempt to negotiate liberalisation ofworld trade in textiles."    GATT's council also decided to set up a working party tostudy China's application for full GATT membership. The groupis due to report to the next GATT council meeting on April 15. Reuter&#3;
