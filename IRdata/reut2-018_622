New York Federal Reserve President E.Gerald Corrigan said he favors bank reform but wants tomaintain the separation of banking and commerce.    "As I see it, the case for fundamental reform in our bankingand financial system is compelling," Corrigan told the SenateBanking Committee.    Corrigan said he believed bank reform should allow banks tooffer a broad range of banking and financial services.    He said common ownership of banks, thrifts, securitiesfirms and insurance companies should be allowed but commercialfirms should not own or control insured depositories.    Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc) said he wouldpress for bank reform legislation this year and supportedgiving banks new power for commercial paper, mortgage-backedsecurities, municipal bond underwriting and mutual funds.    Former Citicorp Chairman Walter Wriston said bank reformshould reflect the reality that other companies were offeringbanking services such as checking accounts credit cards andmortgages.             "The reality is that there is one-stop financial shopping atbanks in some states, but not in others," Wriston said.    "There is also one-stop financial shopping in all 50 statesat a Sears store or American Express office."    "We must find ways for banks to deliver new products to newcustomers in order to maintain a spread of risk in a businessthat is rapidly losing traditional products and customers," hesaid.    But John Weinberg of Goldman, Sachs and Co said allowingbanks to enter the securities business would make banks toopowerful. Reuter&#3;
