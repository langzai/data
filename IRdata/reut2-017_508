Texaco Inc &lt;QTX> said it willsupport the efforts of a Texas legislature joint committee,which will study and propose remedies for problems with theprocedural bond and lien rules of the Texas judiciary.    The rules, which require a defendant in a civil case topost a bond in the full amount of the judgment plus interest inorder to exercise its right to appeal the judgment, directlyled to Texaco to file for protection under Chapter 11 of theFederal Bankruptcy Code, Texaco said.       Texaco said it was unfortunate that it took its bankruptcyto illustrate the need for reform.    Texaco also said Pennzoil Co's &lt;PZL> obstructive tacticsprevented similar legislation earlier in the legislature'ssession, which would have provided the trial judge in Texasflexibility to set the bond at a level appropriate to securethe interest of the judgment creditor based on thecircumstances of the case.    Under current law, Texaco said it would have had to postthe full 11.1 billion dlrs to exercise its right to appeal thejudgment. Reuter&#3;
