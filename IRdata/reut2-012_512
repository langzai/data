U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to openforeign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statementto the Senate Finance Committee.    "In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon othernations into opening their markets with threats of U.S.restrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly forglobal liberalization," Yeutter said.    Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctionsagainst Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pendingtrade bill.    Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S.competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoidprovoking foreign retaliation.    He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandateU.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.    Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateraltrade negotiating round and called on Congress to quicklyapprove an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.    "We want to open foreign markets and establish and enforcerules of international competition, not foster dependence onprotection and subsidies," he said. Reuter&#3;
