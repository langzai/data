Antonio Ortiz Mena, president of theInter-American Development Bank, warned that if Latin countrieswere unable to speed up their economic growth, then in the longrun there would be a default.    He told a press conference foreshadowing the bank's annualmeeting next week, "For the banks it is convenient to berepaid. But to achieve that, the countries need to grow. Ifthey don't, then in the long run there will be a default."    Ortiz Mena warned that Latin America needed to reverse thecapital outflows from the region and beyond that needed moreresources.    Ortiz Mena declined to agree with estimates that capitaloutflows from Latin America last year totaled 35 billion dlrsand that therefore he was calling for an inflow into the regionabove that sum.    He said the U.S. debt strategy, which envisaged stepped uplending by commercial and multilateral banks to major debtornations of 29 billion dlrs over three years, was insufficientto achieve the necessary rates of growth.    But he did stress the U.S. plan was important and the rightapproach.    Ortiz Mena said, "It is in the interest of the creditors,not only the debtors, to push forward the development processin Latin America and that has happened."    He added, "The only problem is the resources have not beenenough."    Turning to Brazil, whose growth rate he predicted willdecline slightly this year from 1986, Ortiz Mena said thecountry's moratorium was the right action in order to avert along term default.    "So it's preferable they negotiate now," a move which wouldeliminate any chance of panic in the markets.    Ortiz Mena also said that Brazilian authorities have openednegotiations already with commercial banks.    He pointed out Brazil took the action because of itsdeteriorating economic situation.
