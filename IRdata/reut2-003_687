Negotiators at a United Nationsconference on natural rubber are making slow progress towardsreaching an agreement, delegates said.    The conference, which began Monday, is widely seen as thefinal effort to adopt a new International Natural RubberAgreement (INRA) before the current one expires in October.    Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking partin the two-week meeting. This is the fourth such conference innearly two years.    Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the keyissue of the price adjustment mechanism.    Consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervalsinstead of 18 months as at present, a proposal currentlyrejected by producers.    And while consumers press for the price adjustment to beautomatic, producers have resisted reducing the role of theInternational Rubber Organization Council in the priceadjustment procedure.    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has said itwas "imperative" to settle outstanding issues this week so thattechnical drafting work can be done next week. Reuter&#3;
