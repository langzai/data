There is little scope for a substantialincrease in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said FederalNational Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell.    Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association,Maxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon.    "I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. Ifanything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than totighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of theeconomy are showing weakness," Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buysmortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities.    Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last twoyears had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Aone pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.    Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds outother sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital.    "There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out ofthe long-term debt market," he said. Both home mortgage debtand long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual ratesof about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.
