Organisation of African UnityChairman Denis Sassou-Nguesso said Africa was unable to pay itsdebts due to falling export prices.    "Even if African countries want to pay their debts they willnot be able to," Congolese president Sassou-Nguesso told a newsconference at a meeting between foreign and African experts onthe continent's economic prospects.    "You cannot be expected to do the impossible. All ourcommodity exports, without exception and even oil, have fallenin value on international markets," he added.    "In these conditions can African countries continue torespect their debt servicing?" Sassou-Nguesso asked.    He said the debt issue would be the main subject at nextmonth's OAU summit in Addis Ababa and would not rule out thepossibility of a joint "debtors' revolt" there.    "Let us wait and see," he replied when asked about thepossibility.    Debts of sub-Saharan African countries total less than 100billion dlrs, according to the Economic Commission for Africawhich is organising the current meeting in Nigeria's futurecapital. REUTER&#3;
