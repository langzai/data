The French 1986 current account balanceof payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announcedlast month, the Finance Ministry said.    This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and whileit is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower thanthe 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialistgovernment before they lost office in March last year.    Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billionfrancs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to amajor program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.    In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, butthe adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion.    Fourth quarter medium and long-term foreign debt repaymentsexceeded new credits by 11 billion francs. REUTER&#3;
