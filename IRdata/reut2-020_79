The spokesman said Goldman took the decision on its owninitiative on Tuesday morning after a number of mutual fundshad reported a cash squeeze because of a flood of redemptionsby stock market investors.    The New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and ExchangeCommission were informed of the move, he said.    The spokesman described the action as an effort to behelpful.
