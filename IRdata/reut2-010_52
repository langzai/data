The Reagan administration said thenational crisis in liability insurance eased during the pastyear as the insurance industry's profits more than doubled to11.5 billion dlrs, but some problems still persist.    An administration working group, in an update of its reporta year ago, found that insurance premiums generally havestabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated.    After severe financial difficulties in 1984 and 1985, theinsurance industry's rate of return last year recovered to thesame level as the performace of U.S. corporations in general,the group said in a 98-page study.    While the crisis has eased, the study found that liabilityinsurance will likely remain expensive and continue to bedifficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for somesectors of the American economy.    Some types of insurance, especially associated withenvironmental liability, remain unavailable for many companiesat any price, it said.    The increased availability and the price stability forinsurance the past year has been accompanied by higherdeductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policyrestrictions, the study said.    The administration last year unveiled a wide range ofrecommendations aimed at dealing with the crisis, including limits on punitive damages and awards for pain, suffering andmental anguish at 100,000 dlrs.    Attorney General Edwin Meese told a news conference todaythat the administration still supports state efforts to placelimits on damage awards and to enact other reforms of the tortlaws.    Assistant Attorney General Richard Willard denied chargesby consumer groups that the insurance crisis was caused byindustry collusion to raise rates in violation of the antitrustlaws. Willard, the head of the working group, said excessivejury damage awards was the main reason for the insuranceliability problem. Reuter&#3;
