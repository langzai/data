The U.S. International TradeCommission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department toimpose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozenconcentrated orange juice.    The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition inits final ruling on the matter.    Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the CommerceDepartment's final ruling of March 9, and activates ananti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozenconcentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigatorsaid.    The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports haveinjured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had alreadyruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decisionlast fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.    The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted onimports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice sinceCommerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.    Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.    Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons ofBrazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.    Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallontariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.    An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its finalreport on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.    Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order andtransmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entriesdating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessingduties, Vastagh said.    He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,including three major shippers, would be affected by thedecision. Reuter&#3;
