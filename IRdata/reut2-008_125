World governmentsshould prepare for an inevitable significant increase in theprice of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp&lt;XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said.    Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulkof world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in aspeech prepared for delivery to the Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) annual conference.    It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewherewill not change this fact, he said.    McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields containabout 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.    Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside theMiddle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in thelast 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.    He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at therate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.    More than half of remaining proved reserves are in theMiddle East, he said.    McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oiloutside the Middle East because each addition contributes to adiversity of supply desirable for global political and economicstability.    "It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-countrydiscoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stabletaxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up ofacreage for exploration," he said.    Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost theincentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources ofpetroleum, he added. REUTER&#3;
