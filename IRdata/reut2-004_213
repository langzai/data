K Mart Corp said its record fiscal1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrsa year ago, marked a "major turning point" for the world'ssecond biggest retailer.    K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter endedJanuary 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from "merchandising, refurbishing and expense control."    A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs fordiscontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retailoperations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs ashare compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.    K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said "the success of theseprograms is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increasein 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxesto 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reachedthis milestone."    Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prioryear. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinuedoperations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over1985, it said.    Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumeracceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, "a marked increasein hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution fromspecialty retailing operations."    K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income fromcontinuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.    K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pctfrom 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general andadministrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pctin 1985.    "Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for KMart," Fauber said in a statement.    "In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused onchanging the look of our stores and the structure of thecompany."    K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for storeremodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialtyretailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructuredits long-term debt.    "We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form ofslower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investmentcommunity. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,our improved performance is proof that our approach is correctfor the long term," the K Mart chairman said. Reuter&#3;
