The Environmental Protection Agencyproposed rules to shield water supplies from potential leaksfrom 1.4 mln underground storage tanks, nearly half of whichare used to store gasoline at service stations.    It said the rules would require owners and operators of thetanks containing petroleum products or certain hazardouschemicals to monitor the tanks for leaks and, in case of leaks,to notify appropriate authorities.    The owners and operators of petroleum tanks would also befinancially responsible for any contamination, the EPA said.    It said financial requirements for chemical tanks will beproposed later.    Hazardous tanks are regulated separately.    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said "Thousands of undergroundstorage tanks are currently leaking and, without adequatecontrols, many more can be expected to leak in the future,endangering our nation's drinking-water supplies."    He added in a statement "We intend to ensure that eachunderground tank is either upgraded or closed down and thatsafe operating and cleanup procedures are following to providemaximum protection from any future leaks." reuter&#3;
