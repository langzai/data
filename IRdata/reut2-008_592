Suzuki Motor Co Ltd &lt;SZMT.T> isnegotiating a joint venture with Hungary to assemble compactcars there following a request from its government, the firstentry by a Japanese car maker into a Communist country, aSuzuki spokesman said.    The company, in which General Motors Corp &lt;GM.N> has a 4.9pct stake, has to set up such projects to avoid cuttingcomponent production in Japan. Existing overseas vehicleprojects are increasing local content and so using fewerJapanese parts, the spokesman said.    Its Indian joint venture &lt;Maruti Udyog Ltd>, MUL, 26 pctowned by Suzuki, will reduce component imports from Japan as itincreases local content to 60 pct from the present 40 pct in1987, the spokesman said.    The yen's continued rise against the dollar and Japan'sself-imposed restrictions on exports to the U.S. And Europewere also to blame for cuts in car component manufacture inJapan, he said. REUTER&#3;
