A Circuit Court judge orderedthe company that insured the solvency of International MedicalCentres Inc to show cause why it should not honour its contractwith International, according to Florida's Department ofInsurance, which had filed a petition on the matter.    As previously reported, International, the largest healthmaintenance organisation in Florida was declared insolvent onMay 14. Federal regulators had also told the company itsMedicare contract would be terminated on July 31 because of thecompany's financial and management problems.    Michelle McLawhorn, Florida Department spokeswoman, saidInternational's insurer, State Mutual Life Assurance Co ofAmerica, had made clear it would fight activation of the policybecause International did not provide it with accuratefinancial records. State Mutual could not be reached forcomment.    McLawhorn said it was not yet known how many creditorsInternational had or how big its debt was. The court gave StateMutual 20 days to show why it should not be obliged to payclaims against the solvency policy. REUTER&#3;
