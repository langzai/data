The First Philippine Capital Fund will be launched jointlyby New York investment house &lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers> and theInternational Finance Corp, an affiliate of the World Bank,Ongpin said. He gave no date for the launch.    Ongpin said the implementation of the fund had been delayedby his government's negotiations to reschedule about 9.4billion dlrs of its 27.8 billion dlr foreign debt.    Craig Nalen, president of a U.S.-government backed OverseasPrivate Investment Corp mission which visited Manila inFebruary, told reporters at the time the capital fund wouldamount to at least 100 mln dlrs.
