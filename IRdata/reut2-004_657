The European Airbus Industrie consortiumhas obtained a total of 104 commitments from nine customers forits planned A340 long-range jet and A330 twin-enginedmedium-range jet, the consortium said in a communique here.    Its supervisory board, meeting in Toulouse, "concluded thatthe commercial and industrial objectives ... Have beenfulfilled and that a strong basis for a commercially successfulprogramme has been established," the communique said.    But the consortium still has to obtain funding guaranteesfrom its member governments for the 2.5 billion dlr programme.    The nine committed customers are well above the fiveairlines that the consortium said it needed to launch the planeproject.    "Therefore the supervisory board has decided to take allnecessary steps for a formal launch decision by mid-April 1987to ensure first deliveries of the A340 in May 1992, to befollowed by first deliveries of the A330 a year later," it said.    Airbus is a four-nation consortium grouping Britain,France, West Germany and Spain. REUTER&#3;
