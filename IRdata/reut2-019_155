There will be no serious bids at EuropeanCommunity open market tenders for wheat and barley until ECfarm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, tradesources said.    The failure of farm ministers this week to come to anagreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for exportsubsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as theuncertainty remains.    One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can beavoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situationwill become more serious as time passes.    However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around,lessening the disruptive impact of the delay.    Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feedwheat, will be offered intervention grain through specialtenders, traders said. Reuter&#3;
