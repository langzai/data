Overseas Shipholding Group Inc presidentMorton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during thesecond half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should riseaccordingly.    Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholdersmeeting, said international tanker markets were generally weakthroughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPECoil production has picked up. The result has been a modestimprovement in tanker rates.    Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.       He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 asOPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.    For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net incomeof 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mlndlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a yearago.    The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,or 1.45 dlrs per share.       "The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after fouryears of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeittemporary, rise in freight rates in the international tankermarkets last summer," Hyman said.    He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principalsource of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, whichrepresents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.    Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels. Reuter&#3;
