The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)said Sears, Roebuck and Co and Kellwood Co, a Sears supplier,agreed to pay penalties of 200,000 dlrs each to settle 1981 charges they misrepresented the amount of down filling in coatsthey sold.    The FTC said Sears and Kellwood also pledged to maketruthful advertising claims about the down and feather contentof their garments and to accurately disclose the type offilling on the garments' labels.    The FTC said Kellwood has not made or sold any downgarments since 1983.    The FTC had charged in a 1981 complaint filed in federalcourt that Sears and Kellwood mislabeled and falsely advertisedthe down content of clothing made by Kellwood and sold by bothSears and Kellwood.    As is typical in such cases, the settlement terms did notrequire either company to admit or deny the charges.    The FTC vote to accept the settlement was 4-1.    In a dissent, Commissioner Andrew Strenio argued that thesettlement terms held Sears to a lower standard than the restof the clothing industry. Reuter&#3;
