A spokeswoman for the London StockExchange said there was no question of trading being suspendedbecause of the unprecedented three-day drop in prices, whichhas seen almost 23 pct wiped off share values.    Trading on the Hong Kong market has been called off untilMonday because of the steep slide on Wall Street amid panicselling on all the world's stock exchanges.    The Tokyo market was 14.9 pct off last night after a huge508 point (22.5 pct) fall on Wall Street yesterday.    The Stock Exchange said although the Stock ExchangeAutomated Quotation (SEAQ) system was working perfectly, "fastmarket" conditions may pevail periodically.    A "fast market" indicator is displayed at the bottom of theSEAQ screen when the huge volume of activity is delaying pricesfrom entering the system, making screen prices lag behind theprevailing market.    Such conditions are reviewed every 30 minutes and at 1000GMT were withdrawn and all on screen prices became firm.    The Exchange said the mandatory quote period will still endat 1600 GMT but depending upon trading activity the marketindices may again be calculated up to 1630 GMT instead of theusual 1600 GMT.    At 0945 GMT the FTSE 100 share index was down 259.1 pointsat 1,793.2, 12.6 pct lower so far today. REUTER&#3;
