The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have asubstantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company'sannual report says.    One provision repeals the reserve method of providing forbad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets andrequires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, berestored to current earnings status, it said.    As a result, those amounts will be subject to federaltaxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.    Continental said it decided to deal with this change "inits entirety" in 1987.    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitationrules, and although the impact will not be material in theshort term, the Act will require, for the first time, thatincome from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the reportsaid.    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, itsaid.    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting theuse of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continentaltakes place, the report said.    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpsells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the nexttwo years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.    In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its juniorconvertible preference stock in Continental to the public inthe form of common stock. Reuter&#3;
