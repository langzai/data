A Bank of Japan spokesman declined tocomment on a press report that the central bank had decided toconduct closer scrutiny of the operations of financialinstitutions in the bond market.    The JIJI Press news agency had quoted Bank of Japan sourcesas telling Japanese reporters the bank was deeply concernedover potential risk in yen bond trading because the market hadrisen too fast.    However, JIJI quoted the sources as saying, the centralbank would not take such actions as guiding interest rateshigher.    JIJI quoted the sources as saying that current bond marketyields are similar to short-term interest rates due toexcessive speculative operations.    This was attributable to heavy redemptions of governmentbonds and unclear prospects for the dollar, which has sent manyforeign bond market participants to the domestic market, thesources were quoted as saying.
