Malaysian miners criticised theU.S. For violating an agreement with Southeast Asian producersby selling more stockpiled tin in 1986 than agreed.    The U.S. General Services Administration sold 5,490 tonnesof tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000tonnes, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said.    In its latest annual report, it said the U.S. Had promisedto limit sales of tin in a memorandum of understanding signedwith the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) in December 1983.    "The U.S. Appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEANMemorandum of Understanding," the Chamber said.    The Chamber estimated the U.S. Strategic stockpile held180,444 tonnes of tin in December 1986, 137,744 tonnes inexcess of of its original stockpile goal of 42,700.    The main ASEAN tin producers are Malaysia, Indonesia andThailand, which produce the bulk of the world's tin. REUTER&#3;
