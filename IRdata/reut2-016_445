GTE Corp said the decline in itsfirst quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.    This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reportedon operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior toentering a joint venture with United Telecommunications &lt;UT> inJuly 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct ofSprint.    Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.    Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, "we expect USSprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer trafficmigrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distancetelecommunications.    The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices aswell as higher operating costs related, in part, to thefraudalent use of the network.    Operating income of its telephone operations, which accountfor 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs. Revenues from telephone operations rose eight pct to 2.9billion dlrs. Reuter&#3;
