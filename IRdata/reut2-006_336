Turner and Newall Plc said it planned toraise a net 71.7 mln stg with a one-for-six rights issue of36.15 mln shares.    The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner'sprice which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.    The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings,which had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as aresult of the takeover of &lt;AE Plc>.    The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mlnstg from 39.6 mln previously.    It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment ofsome 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowingsof some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year endhad risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. Therights issue would cut borrowings and also allow furtherdevelopment through investment and acquisition.    But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won aftera long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthenedthe group's position in the automotive components andengineering materials sectors.    In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 monthspreviously.   As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional untilDecember 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986results.    Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forwardto taking advantage of the opportunities available.   1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart fromZimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the localcurrency against the dollar.
