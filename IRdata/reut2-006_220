The Financial Times newspaper said ithas launched a new international share index, which representsmore than 70 pct of the world's total stock market value. TheFT-Actuaries World Indices, published for the first time today,feature a main world share index and indices plotting themovement of share prices in different regions and individualcountries, the FT said.    The first world share indices will be published on anup-to-date daily basis. The indices are based on the prices ofaround 2,400 equity securities from 23 countries.    Calculated on the same basis as the FT-Actuaries Indicesfor UK securities, the indices will be produced daily andpublished in the Financial Times. The daily tables have aseries of regional indices together with the overall worldindex.    The FT said its main aim was to provide a set ofmeasurements against which the performance of internationalfund managers could be judged. Markets, companies andsecurities have been included only when direct holdings ofshares by foreign nationals are allowed, it said. The FT saidto keep the whole series manageable it has kept the number ofcompanies from the U.S. To 600.    The indices are calculated in three seperate currencies -the US dollar, sterling and the appropriate local currency.
