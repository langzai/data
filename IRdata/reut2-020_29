The Philippine coconut industry hasgreeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a billrequiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.    The bill, which was defeated by the Senate AgricultureCommittee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a yearin lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.    "Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance thebill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to anotherSenate bill," a spokesman for the United Coconut Association ofthe Philippines (UCAP).    PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, witheight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.    The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association(ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.    He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue duringthe debate.    "Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturatedanimal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systemsleaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease," he said.    U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued thatsaturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels woulddiscourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favourof domestic unsaturated alternatives.    Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminatedagainst imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia andIndonesia.    The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut productsin 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.    Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible useaccount for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said. REUTER&#3;
