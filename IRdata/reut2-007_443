The Justice Department mishandled aninvestigation into alleged fraud on Navy contracts by a unit ofTenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, two senior senators charged.    The charges, made jointly by Sens. William Proxmire,D-Wis., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, were based on a report bysubcommittee staffs of the Senate Judiciary Committee and theJoint Economic Committee on the Justice Departmentinvestigation.    "Serious mistakes were made at every stage of the NewportNews investigation and much time wasted during lengthy periodsof inactivity," the report said.    The Tenneco unit, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry DockCo, asked the Navy in 1976 for reimbursement of 894 mln dlrs incost overruns in the construction of 14 nuclear-powered ships.The Navy settled the claims for 208 mln dlrs in 1978 and thenrefered the case to the Justice Department for investigation ofpossible fraud.    In 1983, the Justice Department decided to end theinvestigation without prosecuting Newport News.        Reuter&#3;
