First Interstate Bancorp ChairmanJoseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16mln dlrs per year, after taxes, if it had to put its medium andlong-term debt on non-accrual status.    In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5pct decline in annual earnings per share.    Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yetdecided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying intereston last month, on non-accrual status.    "None of us really wants to injure negotiations that mightbe going on," he said.    First Interstate reported to the Securities and ExchangeCommission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs inmedium-to long-term loans to Brazil.    It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilianoutstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs.    First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-termloans or trade lines to Brazil.    Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debtcrisis will be more political than economic, which he said hefinds, "very disquieting and discomforting." Reuter&#3;
