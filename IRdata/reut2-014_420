Over-investment and over-production areat the root of many of the difficult trade issues that havesoured relations between the United States and some of itsmajor trading partners, trade representative Clayton Yeuttersaid.    He told a conference, held by the University of Chicago'sGraduate Business School, that much of this was caused bygovernments "getting their finger in the pot."    Yeutter referred specifically to the problems ofagricultural trade, where subsidized exports have been a pointof contention most notably between the United States and theEuropean Community.    "Think of the vast waste of financial and other resources,"he said.    Yeutter said much of the problem underlying the disputewith Japan over semiconductors was due to overproduction.    The trade representative called for a long-term approach tointernational trade and said the recent commitment to afree-trade agreement between the United States and Canada was astep in the right direction.    There's a lot of work to be done in the next six months,but we have set October 1 as a target date for an agreement tobe reached, he added.    "We're trying to create an environment that will facilitateand foster free and open trade in the world," he said. Reuter&#3;
