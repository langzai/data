Hardliners have blocked debate on a keyeconomic reform in China's parliament, a clear challenge toreformers among the leadership, western diplomats said.    The annual session of the National People's Congress nextweek was to have discussed a draft law which would bolster theindependence of factory chiefs while eroding the power of localCommunist Party officials.    The decision not to include the draft law was announced bythe congress's standing committee, the People's Daily said. Thecommittee's chairman is Peng Zhen, considered one of the moreconservative figures in the Chinese leadership.    The "factory director responsibility system" covered by thedraft law has already been experimentally introduced in statefirms over the last three years, giving managers greaterfreedom from the control of factory party committees.    Diplomats said the agenda decision appeared to contradictassurances by top leader Deng Xiaoping that reforms were notthreatened by the current campaign against "bourgeoisliberalisation," or western political ideas.    Earlier this week Deng raised expectations for the sessionby saying plans to reform China's political structure would beunveiled in 1987, diplomats said. REUTER&#3;
