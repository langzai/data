U.K. Agriculture Minister MichaelJopling said an OECD study which calculates the level ofdomestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a goodbasis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.    The controversial study, which has not yet been released bythe Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farmsubsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECDsources in Paris said last month.    Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday,suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducingdomestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of tradenegotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.    The OECD study shows that there are few countries which donot significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.    The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies forthe years 1979 through 1981.    Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as anegotiating tool, however, by saying the European Communitywould want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actionstaken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.    Representatives of other industrial countries told Reutersthey are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.    An Australian trade official said Canberra has "gravetechnical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations.U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the studyincluding the necessity to update the calculations to reflectrecent changes in farm programs worldwide.    The officials said the study may be released in May. Reuter&#3;
