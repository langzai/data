Treasury Secretary James Baker saidmassive new lending to debtor nations could actually increasetheir difficulties in the period ahead without protections.    In testimony before the Senate Committee on GovernmentalAffairs, Baker said, "throwing money at the debtor nations won'tsolve their problems."    Baker told the committee such an approach could "worsentheir difficulties unless the new financing can be productivelyabsorbed and is consistent with their ability to grow andservice debt."    He said the debt initiative associated with his name is along-term approach and further progress "will be gradual andwill vary among nations, depending upon their own determinationto implement growth-oriented reforms and on the continuedactive support of the international community."
