GTE Corp scientists said theyhave discoverd a much simpler method for producing transistorsby creating an entirely new electronic material.    The new method, they said, consists of simultaneously"growing" metal connections and silicon crystals together toform one, three dimensional device with connections penetratingthe entire device.    Conventional transistors require many steps to make andhave connections only on the surface.    GTE Laboratories created "an entirely new electronicmaterial and device form, which may open up a spectrum of usesthat cannot even be imagined at this time," said David Decker,vice president and director of research for GTE Laboratories.    "Although still early in our research, we are obviouslyexcited that we have found a significantly simpler and, webelieve, cheaper way to produce an electronic device," he said.    Researchers at GTE created the new transistor by combiningand heating silicon and a conductive metal, tantalumdisilicide, so that the two grow together.    The resulting device has microscopic metal rods extendingthrougout the chips, creating a three dimensional transistorthat should be superior to standard devics in high powerapplications, the scientists said.    They said that, because the connections extend verticallythrougout the new device, it has a much greater volume ofactive material than conventional surface-mounted connections.    Decker said the scientists are still in the early stages oftheir research on the device, but prototypes of the new devicecompare favorably with conventionaly made transistors and showpromise of superior performance.    He said the prototype device also proved to be particularlyefficient in detecting light, which could open up newpossibilities in solar energy conversion, the development ofelectronic cameras and greater efficiency in opticalcommunication systems.
