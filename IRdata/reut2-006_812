Asked what the U.S. StateDepartment's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leadersthat U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.    "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they maybe, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,"Shultz told the board of directors for the National Associationof Wheat Growers.    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say thatsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the samething at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't," hesaid.    "That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,and it must be our approach as we look at the American farmprogram and try to figure out what we should do to make itbetter," Shultz told the Wheat Growers.    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation thatwould allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than theAmerican housewife, he realizes the importance of Americanagricultural products being competitively priced.    Speculation has been in the market for some time that theUnited States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Unionat subsidized prices.    Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if itwere competitively priced. Agriculture Department officialshave declined to take any official position on the issue. Reuter&#3;
