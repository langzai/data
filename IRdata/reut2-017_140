A cargo of U.S. corn for the SovietUnion was rejected and forced to be unloaded at a Chicagoexport elevator earlier this week after it failed to makegrade, with the British vessel Broompark now being reloaded, anelevator spokesman said.    The first attempt to load the ship failed when thepercentage of broken kernels proved to be higher than contractspecifications, he said.    The Soviets traditionally refuse to take sub-grade grain ata price discount, as is the practice with many other importingnations, he added.    The official estimated the reloading of the vessel withabout 700,000 tonnes of corn may be completed by Tuesday, April28. Reuter&#3;
