Office of Management and Budgetdirector James Miller said President Reagan opposes increasesin the federal excise taxes on gas, cigarettes or alcohol tohelp reduce the federal budget deficit.    In an address before a group of House Republicans, Millerreiterated Reagan's opposition to an oil import duty. "I thinkalso he would opose an increase in the gas tax."    He said there was no reason to think Reagan had changed hisopposition to a cigarette tax hike. "In the case of thecigarette tax, we have no evidence the appropriate tax ishigher than now, and the same on wine and spirits."    Miller urged the Republicans to hold firm against a taxhike to reduce the estimated 174 billion dlr deficit for the1988 financial year.    House Democratic budget writers are expected to recommendan 18 to 20 billion dlr revenue increase as part of the 1988budget. However, the composition of the taxes would be left tothe tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee to decide.    Reagan's 1988 budget proposed 22 billion in revenueincreases from sales of federal assets such as the Amtrakrailroad, higher federal fees for services and largerindividual payments for social programs.    "It's so essential to us to hold on that point of no taxincrease," Miller said.    He added that House Speaker Jim Wright's proposal to set anew tax on security transactions was "a nonstarter" with theWhite House. The tax would be a tax on capital which woulddiscourage all but the most profitable short-term transactionsand could lead to creation of a duty-free market abroad.    "Control spending, get the deficit down and oppose any taxincrease," Miller urged the Republicans.    Congress has set 108 billion dlrs as its deficit target for1988. Reuter&#3;
