Dutch Finance Minister Onno Rudingsaid there was a growing feeling in the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund that commercial banks and debtorcountries should take a greater lead in assembling newfinancing packages.    "The IMF and the Bank may be less inclined to put togetherlarge packages like Mexico," Ruding told reporters in a briefingon this week's semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks.    Ruding, who is also chairman of the IMF's policy-makingInterim Committee, said he was reflecting a feeling within thetwo institutions.    Asked whether his comments reflected a feeling theinstitutions were being unduly pressured by the Reaganadministration, Ruding replied "we should not go in thedirection of politicisation of the two institutions."    Ruding said "no country large or small should push in thatdirection."  He said he expected commercial bank lending todebtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace oflending recently. Ruding also said he did not expect any majorinitiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in thedebt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debtcrisis itself.    In other remarks, Ruding said many countries supported aGeneral Capital Increase for the World Bank and he expectedBank president Barber Conable also to express his support.    The U.S. has said it is opposed to a GCI at present.    Ruding said the Interim Committee Communique would supportthe use of indicators to assist multilateral surveillance butwould stop short of supporting U.S. proposals for automaticconsultations if indicators were sharply out of line withpolicy objectives. Monetary sources say the U.S. has suggestedestablishing "norms" or automatic triggers for consultationsamong industrial states if policies deviate from plan.    Currently the plan also has the support of France, theNetherlands and Italy while Britain, Japan and West Germany areall opposed. Reuter&#3;
