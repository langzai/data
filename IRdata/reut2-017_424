U.S. Interior Secretary DonaldHodel said he does not support an oil import fee as a means tostimulate domestic oil and gas production.    "I am an advocate for incentives for exploration," Hodelsaid, but added, "I do not favor an oil import fee."    "It would inject the federal government so deeply back into the process, we would never get the government out again,and I think that would be in the long term disinterest of thenation," Hodel said in an address to a group of local businessexecutives.    Earlier today, Congressmen from oil producing statesintroduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports.    Hodel said he supports drilling incentives, such as repealof the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulationof natural gas.    The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshoreCalifornia and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge isnecessary to prevent the U.S. from becoming too dependent onforeign supplies of oil for its energy needs.    Failure to approve such exploration, Hodel said, would leadto greater U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil.    "In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today,we are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or moredependent on imports for its oil requirements," Hodel said.    If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply, Congress wouldlikely act to have the federal government fix gasoline pricesand allocate supplies, Hodel said.    "If they allocate supplies you and I, in the sametwo-to-five year time frame, could well find ourselves sittingback in gas lines," Hodel said.    Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in theArctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardizeenvironmentally sensitive areas, Hodel said.    "We are convinced we can meet and resolve everyenvironmental concern that is raised," Hodel said. Reuter&#3;
