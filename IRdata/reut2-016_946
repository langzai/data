TransCanada PipeLines Ltd deniedreports that it raised its offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP>to 5.5 billion Canadian dlrs from 4.3 billion.    A report on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) late lastnight said TransCanada's new bid was rejected by Dome, whichhas accepted a 5.1 billion dlr bid from Amoco Corp &lt;AN>.    "We still want to acquire Dome's assets and are prepared tonegotiate. However, we have not presented a new proposal to thecompany since April 16 and Dome has refused to negotiate withTransCanada since that date," said TransCanada president GeraldMaier.    TransCanada said its proposal consists of two parts -- 4.5billion dlrs in cash and securities and one billion dlrs ofpayments to creditors based on future profits.    Last week, TransCanada valued the first part of its offerat 4.3 billion dlrs, but a spokesman today said the companyincreased the estimated value of that part to 4.5 billion dlrsafter the recent gain in Dome's stock.    Dome was halted today on the Toronto Stock Exchange pendingclarification of TransCanada's offer. It last traded at 1.70dlrs per share. Two weeks ago, before TransCanada's offer, Dometraded at about 1.10 dlrs per share. Reuter&#3;
