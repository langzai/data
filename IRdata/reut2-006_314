The Reagan administration willconsider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitiveindustries such as semiconductors and computers, the New YorkTimes said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.    "I think there's a strong sentiment here that someindustries are not totally up for grabs," the paper quoted theofficial as saying.    "Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor andcomputer companies," said the official, who the newspaper saidwas a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd&lt;ITSU.T> takeover bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>.    The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, andindustry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reaganadministration in its drive to beat back Japanese competitionin the important computer chip manufacturing industry.    Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger foughtthe planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled SchlumbergerLtd &lt;SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it couldhave left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources forvital technology.    The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time hadcome to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.    "Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there haveto be some exceptions for the national interest," Baldrige wasquoted as saying.    The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected tobring the takeover issue before a top-level interagencypolicymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker'sEconomic Policy Council or the president's National SecurityCouncil.
