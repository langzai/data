Pacific Gas and Electric Co saidit expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision tochange the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear PowerPlant revenues.    The accounting change will not affect the company's cashposition and the company intends to continue paying itsdividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or2.60 dlrs per share.    Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted bydelays in the receipt of a California Public UtilitiesCommission decision on the company's 1984 application for raterelief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructingunits one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.    It said the commission is currently allowing the company torecover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each monthas deferred non-cash account receivable, which has beenincluded in current income.    But the accounting change, effective January 1, willreflect only cash received through interim rates approved bythe commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.    It also said the commission is now awaiting its PublicStaff Division's report which will recommend how much of the5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed torecover in rates.    The company further stated that it is confident it willreceive an objective review of the facts.    It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.    Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear powerunits in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit onewent into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line inMarch last year.
