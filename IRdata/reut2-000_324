The European Community Commission saidit has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Unionis dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.    The Commission said its decision follows a complaint fromEC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Sovietmercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in theEuropean industry.    According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EChad risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes betweenAugust and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct ofthe EC market if they continue at the same pace.    The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them tocut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. Theimports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.    The Commission said the industry would probably be unableto hold prices at current levels and that any increase wouldresult in loss of sales and jobs.    The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by theCommission will allow all interested parties to state theircases to the authority. REUTER&#3;
