The Ugandan government, in its fouryear investment and development plan, proposed taxing land andfood crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away fromdependence on coffee sales.    The government also said in the plan, made available toReuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would dolittle to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit.    The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni tookpower 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs ininvestment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991.    It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrsin pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mlndlrs at a conference in Kampala last week.    Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at theend of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debtservicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of exportearnings of 431 mln, the plan said.    The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on largeland holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploitingthem, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by theProduce Marketing Board.    The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which inUganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffeefarmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchangeearnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue.    On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argumentthat any form of fotation would not help allocating resources.    Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandanshilling is grossly overvalued and the government must changethe exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment. Theshilling sells on the black market at more than 15,000 to thedollar, compared with an official rate of 1,400. REUTER&#3;
