Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said a bill passed this week by the Senate bankingcommittee is too restrictive regarding the Federal Reserve.    "I don't think our hands should be tied so much as in thatbill," he said.    The bill would set a one-year moratorium on approval ofcertain powers that banks have already applied to the FederalReserve for -- selling insurance, securities and real estate.    Volcker added, however, that comprehensive new legislationdealing with such issues is needed. Reuter&#3;
