The Democratic-controlled HouseBudget Committee, over Republican protests, approved and sentto the House a trillion dlr spending budget for 1988 that wouldcut the anticipated federal deficit by about 38 billion dlrs.    The Democratic-written budget would produce about a 133billion dlr deficit using the nonpartisan Congressional BudgetOffice economic assumptions.    Using President Reagan's more optimistic assumptions thedeficit would be about 108 billion dlrs -- which would reach anew budget law's goal. Reuter&#3;
