Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger hasordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf inan effort to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to keep oilflowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported.    The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navywould keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in theArabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, threemonths longer than planned.    The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six toeight warships in the area at all times rather than part of thetime, as happens now, the paper said.    The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sourcessaid they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of aChinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait ofHormuz.    It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was readyto continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war againstIraq.    U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range ofthose missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quotedofficials as saying.    From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launchaircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships couldfire long-range missiles, the paper said. REUTER&#3;
