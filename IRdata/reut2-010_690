Belgian starch manufacturer &lt;Amylum NV>is surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr offer forthe European business of CPC International Inc &lt;CPC.N> wasapparently rejected in favour of a lower 630 mln dlr bid byItaly's &lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi>, chairman Pierre Callebaut said.    Callebaut told Reuters that Amylum, a leading starch andisoglucose manufacturer in which Britain's Tate and Lyle Plc&lt;TATL.L> holds a 33.3 pct stake, had made an undisclosedinitial takeover offer for CPC's European corn wet millingbusiness by the close of CPC's tender on March 17.    The offer was raised on March 24 to a final 675 mln dlrs incash after CPC told Amylum its initial bid was below Ferruzzi's630 mln stg offer, Callebaut said.    On the same day, CPC announced it had agreed in principleto sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlrdeal.    Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering ofshares in its unit &lt;European Sugar (France)> to fund the CPCtakeover, Callebaut said Amylum may still succeed in its bid.    "For the time being we just await developments. But I notethat whereas our higher offer was in cash, Ferruzzi apparentlyis still organising finance," Callebaut said. REUTER&#3;
