Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG[OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record amoderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mlnschilling net profit made in 1986, General Director GerhardWagner said.    Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pctrise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due togreater domestic business and wider margins on schillinginterest rates.    The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividendto 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capitalfrom 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.    Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavourto maintain the higher dividend in 1987."    Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreigncurrency business last year accounted for some 37 pct ofbalance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign businesschiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which iseffectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wipedsome 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits fromthe bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but saidthat it came close to one mln stg.    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pctto 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due tolower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state. Reuter&#3;
