The Finance Ministry plans to furtherease restrictions on large-denomination bank deposits this yearand is studying several deregulation plans, a ministry officialsaid, without elaborating.    Banking sources told Reuters the ministry plans to lowerthe minimum denomination of money market certificates (MMCs) to10 mln yen from 20 mln, the amount slated to be applied fromApril 6. The amount is currently 30 mln yen.    The ministry is also considering shortening the minimumperiod of free-interest large-lot time deposits to one monthfrom the current three months, the sources said.    The Ministry plans to expand the issue period ofcertificates of deposits (CDs) to one week to two years fromthe current one month to one year, the sources said.    They said banks fear the ministry's plans may induce ashift of funds from bank to other financial instruments.    One official of a major bank said the planned moves wereunexpected as deregulation on large deposits was previouslyexpected to have ended with the measures to start in April.    On April 6, the Ministry is scheduled to lower the minimumtime deposit amount to 100 mln yen from the current 300 mln andcut the maximum MMC deposit period to two years from one. REUTER&#3;
