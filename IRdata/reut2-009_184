Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhooshoilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack lastNovember, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences areready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industrysources said.    They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaisedes Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhooshsubsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on thereopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.    Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi,last November 25.    The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main livingquarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main productionplatform.    Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsiblebut Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.    Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resumeat a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff andthe fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.    The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed inremaining accomodations, the sources said.    Facilities being installed to protect the field includeaircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housingfor military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sourcessaid.    Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United ArabEmirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15mln bpd production, the sources said.    They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field,part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located onlya few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi airraid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked. REUTER&#3;
