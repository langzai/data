The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificantinvestment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but netwill fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86ended May 31.    The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28from 813.0 mln a year earlier.    Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln ayear earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November31, BHP said in a statement.    Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end ofshare analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to620 mln dlrs.    BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents afterdeclaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced aone-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.    The bonus is being made from reserves which will notqualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction ofdividend imputation next July 1.    The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHPsaid.    BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate ofdividend will be maintained on the increased capital.    The level of future dividends will be influenced by theimplications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,it said.    As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free inshareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits thathave borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.    BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, saidpetroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mlna year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.    BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflectedgenerally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Straitwhile the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domesticsales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of newplant and some operational difficulties.    The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrsfrom 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase inownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.    The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term,reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of &lt;Blue CircleSouthern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown. REUTER&#3;
