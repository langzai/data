Thailand's major tin exporter andproducer &lt;Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) saidit may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because ofinsufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.    Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales toThaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> unit, to less than20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonneaverage, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters.    He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to letthe temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exportedtin lapse on June 3.    The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct thismonth from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lowerlevels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aidthe tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.    Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet alarge portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100tonnes per day.    As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated bythe Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the yearending February 1988.    Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC toallocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.    The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a MineralResources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes latethis month, Yoot said.    The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tinduring January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago. REUTER&#3;
