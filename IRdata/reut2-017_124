The White House said last month's0.4 per cent in increase in the CPI, the third sharp rise inthree months and one that brought the annual inflation rate to6.2 pct so far this year, was no cause for alarm.    "While this is something to watch, it's not something to bealarmed about," said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.    He said the three month increase in inflation was duealmost entirely to higher energy prices.    Fitzwater said once an OPEC price hike is "passed throughthe system," the nation should see a slowing of the inflationrate to the administration's 3.8 pct 1987 forecast. REUTER&#3;
