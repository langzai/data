Galactic ResourcesLtd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, saidit adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar toother gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.    As a result, the company retroactively charged all pastexploration and related administration costs incurred on itsproperties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.    Under the new policy, all future exploration and relatedadministration costs will be written off to expenses ratherthan capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.    Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mlnU.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediatelydisclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.    The new accounting policy is not expected to adverselyaffect working capital position, future cash flows or thecompany's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, itsaid.    Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs ofcosts concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mlnU.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and othermine developments.    Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, theSummitville mine expenses would have been amortized over thelife of the mine and charged against future earnings.    The change will also result in lower depreciation andamortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs anounce of gold produced in future periods, based on totalestimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.    Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville isexpected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalentproduction since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000ounces. Reuter&#3;
