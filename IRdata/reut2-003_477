The Bank of Spain has extended thereserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta fundsin an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital whichis currently fuelling money supply growth.    In a statement issued late last night, the central banksaid convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subjectto exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserverequirement with effect from Friday.    Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt fromreserve requirements.    The measure comes one week after the central bank raisedreserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentagepoint to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.    Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offernow -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted alarge influx of speculative foreign capital which isthreatening the government's monetary targets.    They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain'sprincipal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquidassets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17pct annualised rate in February, compared with January's 8.3pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. Thetarget for 1987 is eight pct.    The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds tobanks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the moneymarket. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightlyTreasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserverequirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas fromthe system.    The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interestrates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pctaverage for deposits.    Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandableresponse "given that the market is short of funds."    But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interestrates would neutralize the central bank's attempts to curtailshort-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanishmoney markets more attractive.
