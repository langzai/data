High labour costs and slower corporateinvestment could hinder Sweden's economic growth after 1987,the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development,OECD, said.    The Swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than inprevious years. GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on externalfactors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariatsaid in its latest annual report on Sweden.    It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly inSweden than in other OECD countries.    Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, whichlargely relies upon export markets, was losing market share.Wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986, inline with 1985 increases, while public sector wages rose anestimated 9.2 pct in 1986, up from six pct in 1985.    This was significantly higher than average wage increasesof 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986.    The report said wage moderation was central to maintainingeconomic growth in Sweden. It suggested that wage negotiationsshould be at least partly centralised to control the totalwages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels.    Helped by low oil prices and the government's tight fiscalpolicy, inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 fromalmost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most otherOECD countries, the report said.    Unemployment, a principal policy target, was at 2.7 pct in1986, in line with 1985's 2.8 pct and well below the OECDaverage of 8.6 pct. The report said Sweden's employmentpolicies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation.    It also said that economic growth in 1986 reliedincreasingly on private consumption because corporateinvestment in machinery and equipment had shrunk.    The total volume of industrial investments dropped by twopct in 1986, with sharp declines in spending by the wood, pulpand paper industries. This compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985when there was heavy investment in these industries.    The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boostcorporate investments and reduce its dependence on domesticconsumption for economic growth. It suggested there was roomfor reform in the tax system.    Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending,especially in local government, to keep in line with itstighter fiscal policy, the report said. REUTER&#3;
