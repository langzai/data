International Business Machines Corpsaid it introduced four new personal computers, including a topof the line unit based on the powerful Intel Corp &lt;INTC> 80386chip.    The company said the new PC's are compatible with mostexisting IBM PC applications.              The new computers, which mark the first major overhaul ofthe IBM PC line since the company entered the business in 1981,include a PC based on the Intel Corp &lt;INTC> 80386microprocessor, making it the most powerful IBM PC to date.    Also included is an Intel 8086 based system which IBM saidis up to two and a half times as fast as its IBM PC XT model.    IBM also introduced two new versions of its PC AT system.These use an Intel 80286 chip running at 50 pct faster than theexisting IBM PC AT.    The new line of PC's, which IBM calls the PersonalSystem/2, uses 3.5 inch diskettes instead of the conventional5.25 inch diskettes.    The company said the smaller diskettes store from two tofour times more data than larger diskette, which typicallyhandle 360 kilobytes of data.    IBM said the new PC AT's and the 80386-based PC use a newIBM-designed 32-bit data bus. This carries data internallywithin the PC.    The company said the new bus offers processing power up totwo to three-and-a-half times the existing IBM PC AT.    IBM said the new PC's can run a new operating system,called IBM DOS Version 3.3, which is now available.    The company also said it will offer a second operatingsystem, called IBM Operating System/2, developed jointly withMicrosoft Corp &lt;MSFT>. This will be available in stages,beginning in the first quarter of 1988.    IBM said Operating System/2 will for the first time giveIBM PC users the ability to access multiple applications andvery large programs and amounts of data.    IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 30, which is anIntel 8-megahertz (MHz) 8086-based system, is now available ata list price of 1,695 dlrs each with two diskette drives andfor 2,295 dlrs with one diskette and one 20-megabyte fixed diskdrive. The unit weighs 17 pounds.    It said an 8087 math coprocessor that runs at the sameeight MHz rate as the 8086 is available.    The company said the Personal System/2 Model 50, an Intel10 MHz 80286-based desktop system, is now available at a costof 3,595 dlrs.    IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 60, which is alsoan Intel 10 MHz 80286-based system, is a floor-standing systemavailable in two configurations. This system, which isscheduled for availability in the second quarter, lists at5,295 dlrs with a 44MB fixed disk drive and 6,295 dlrs on the70MB fixed disk drive.    The company said the Personal System/2 80 is the mostpowerful member of the new family of PC's, using an Intel80386-based mocroprocessor. The floor-standing machine will beavailable in three configurations.    IBM said one Model 80 configuration, scheduled for Julyavailability at a cost of 6,995 dlrs, runs at 16 MHz, contains1MB of memory and features a 44MB fixed disk drive.    A second configuration, also scheduled for July at 8,495dlrs each, runs at 16 MHz and has 2MB of memory and a 70MBfixed disk drive.    The company said the third Model 80 is scheduled for thefourth quarter and features IBM-designed one-megabit memorytechnology. Expected to cost 10,995 dlrs, it runs at 20 MHz andfeatures 2MB of memory and a 115 MB fixed disk drive.       IBM said its Personal System/2 incorporates enhancedintegrated graphics functions including significantly improvedtext, expanded colors up to 256 out of a palette of more than256,000, and sharper business graphics.    The company said the Models 50, 60 and 80 Video GraphicsArray supports 640 x 480 x 16 colors in graphics mode and 720 x400 x 16 colors in text mode. It will also support the new 320x 200 x 256 color mode.    With the addition of the new advanced graphics feature, IBMsaid, 1024 x 768 addressability also can be obtained. Reuter&#3;
