The House Committee on Energy andCommerce is studying recommendations for stricter penalties forviolation of securities laws, said Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the committee.    Dingell told Reuters after a speech to businessmen herethat insider trading laws must be strengthened to assure thatself-regulation by the securities industry is more effective.    "We've got to see to it that (exchange) members regulatetheir employees," he said.    Dingell said his committee is "looking at a number ofpossibilities" to harshen penalties for violation of securitieslaws. But he would not be more specific, saying proposals onstiffer penalties are still being drafted in Washington.    "I wish I could be more definitive, but I can't," Dingelltold Reuters.    Dingell said another solution to the problem of insidertrading would be a "significant" increase in funding for theSecurities and Exchange Commission, as well as in SEC'sauthority to enforce securities laws.    Dingell added that he supports self-regulation by thesecurities industry rather than government creation of "somenew structure that may or may not work."    "The markets must regulate themselves," he said. Reuter&#3;
