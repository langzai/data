&lt;Placer Pacific Ltd> said it willundertake a full feasibility study of Western Australia's BigBell gold prospect.    Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in whichPlacer has an option with &lt;Australian Consolidated MineralsLtd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enoughto warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement.    Big Bell, in the Murchison goldfield 540 km north east ofPerth, was founded in 1904. Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded22.8 tonnes of gold and 7.8 tonnes of silver while millingabout 30,000 tonnes of ore a month.    Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnesof ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible byopen-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 metersunderground.    It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study nolater than December 31 this year by which time it would havespent three mln dlrs on Big Bell.    If the results are positive and a commitment to developmade then construction would take about 12 months, Placer said. REUTER&#3;
