Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe U.S. imposition of tariffs on Japanese goods oversemiconductor trade does not signal the start of a trade war.    He also played down the significance of the precipitousstock market decline earlier this week.    "I don't think this action should be interpreted in any wayas the start of a trade war," he said in response to a questionfrom a House Appropriations subcommittee.    He said a drop in stock market prices of the magnitudeexperienced Monday was not so unusual.    "I don't think it is particularly unusual to see those kindsof days" on Wall Street, Baker said.    Since Monday, he added, "The stock market has reboundedrather vigorously."    He urged lawmakers to move cautiously on trade legislationto avoid overly protectionist moves which might aggravate worldtrade tensions.    "You're not going to legislate this (trade) deficit away," hetold the panel. Reuter&#3;
