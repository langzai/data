Confronted by new hostilitiesinvolving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to endRepublican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure thatcould give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.    The measure, however, does not require President Reagan tocomply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senatebill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pulloutof U.S. forces from the Gulf.    The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limitdebate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reaganto report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and callsfor a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on thesituation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.    The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,including an expression of support or of disapproval forReagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran inthe waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoybegan moving through the Gulf early Tuesday. Reuter&#3;
