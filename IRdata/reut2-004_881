The U.S. Agriculture Department'sExport Enhancement Program, EEP, contributed to the recentagreement to include farm subsidies in the new round of globaltrade talks, according to the General Accounting Office.    GAO Senior Associate Director Allan Mendelowitz told aSenate Agriculture subcommittee that the EEP has increased thecost of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy.    However, there is little reason to believe that once EEPexpires, gains in U.S. farm exports attributable to the programwill be sustained in targeted markets, he said.    Mendelowitz said broadening the EEP by making itacross-the-board would eliminate charges of discrimination bytraditional buyers and increase pressure on the EC, butantagonize non-subsidizing exporters.
