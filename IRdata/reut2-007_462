The International Sugar Agreement (ISA)will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO)officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after aspecial session of the pact's council.    A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISOsix monthly session in May. The alternatives are between anautumn London conference for another pact without economicclauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or aGeneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economicclauses, he said.    But delegates said the latter would only be considered ifthe world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba andthe European Community -- can resolve differences over howprices can best be supported and how to share the world    Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlierindicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share ofthe ISO budget.    At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would tryand find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg laterthis year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said theU.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its fullcontribution in the last year of the current pact.    The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISObudget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importersand exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of theimporter half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only asingle category of members who would all share the costs prorata to their share of world sugar trade.    The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with thenext full council session in the week of May 19.    There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO. Reuter&#3;
