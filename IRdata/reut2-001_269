The chairman of Goodyear Tire and RubberCo, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,charged that "terrorists in three-piece suits" are underminingthe nation's industrial base.In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raidersand takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harmto the companies they target.  "Their interest is not in preserving and strengtheningAmerica's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Theirproduct is simply deals, and that is not a product which acountry ... can base a future on."    Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by Britishindustrialist Sir James Goldsmith.    But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,Mercer said.    The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mlndlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for overtwo billion dlrs.    In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed downthree plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced itspayroll by 10 pct, he said.    Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearingon a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostiletakeovers have also hurt workers. Reuter&#3;
