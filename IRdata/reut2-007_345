ILFC, a commercial aircraft leasing concern, last week setconditional orders with Airbus, the European consortium, forthree short-haul A320s and three A330s.    "We're negotiating with Airbus for additional units beyondthose six planes," Udvar-Hazy told Reuters in an interview."We're talking mainly about more A320s, but also about moreA330s," he said. He declined to elaborate.    Reports in the French press today indicated that ILFC wasclose to signing an agreement to buy 27 of the A320 jets.    The total value of the order announced last week is 350 mlndlrs.

Airbus has said it will decide by the end of this monthwhether to launch the medium range A330 and the companion, longrange A340. It says it has 104 orders and options from nineairlines for the two planes.    ILFC is one of the launch customers for the A330,Udvar-Hazy noted.
