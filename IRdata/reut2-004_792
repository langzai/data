U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar wouldfall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations'financial, monetary and tax policies.    But, he said, in a speech and remarks to the HeritageFoundation, that in the end "the marketplace will ultimatelyrule the day."    Asked about the future of the dollar, he said that whetheror not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies andcoooperation among trading nations.    Yeutter said "if nations do the right kinds of things infinancial, monetary and tax policies, then a lesser burden ofadjustment is placed on exchange rates, and one could envisiona situation of the major trading nations moving back far closerto what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchangerates becoming relatively stable."    But he said, on the other hand, that if nations did notexhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation,"It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make thatadjustment."
