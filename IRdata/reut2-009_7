A feud among Democrats andRepublicans persisted at the House Budget Committee, stallingthe writing of a fiscal 1988 U.S. budget plan.    Republicans failed to appear at a drafting session calledby Democratic committee chairman William Gray as a make-upmeeting to end bickering that has delayed budget activity  fora week and threatens the ability of Congress meeting an April15 deadline for completing the deficit-cutting budget.    Republicans told Gray yesterday they would appear today andparticipate if the meeting was held behind closed doors.    He said the Republicans were prepared to make a "good faith"effort to cooperate if the budget deliberations were heldbehind closed doors and not in public as is the normalprocedure.    However, they failed to appear today and Gray said he hadbeen told they wanted House Speaker Jim Wright to answer aseries of budget questions posed by House Republican leader BobMichel before they would cooperate in budget matters.     The budget feuding led the Washington Post today toeditorialize that it was childish, similar to an eraser fightamong fourth grade students. Reuter&#3;
