President Reagan said he will vetoan 87.5 billion dlr highway and transit bill, citing hiscommitment to hold to spending cuts to meet budget deficitreduction goals.    "I am adamantly opposed to the excessive spending that is inthe bill as it emerged from a (House-Senate) conferencecommittee," he said in a statement.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan hadreservations on 152 so-called demonstration highway projectsand on the amount for transit projects.    The bill called for transit projects totalling 17.8 billiondlrs, compared to 8.7 billion proposed by the administration.    Fitzwater said, however, that Reagan supported the right ofstates to raise the highway speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph,a provision that is also in the legislation. Reuter&#3;
