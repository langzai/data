Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairmanWilliam Seidman said he is worried that consumer confidencewill be undermined by panic selling of stocks.    "The principal worry is that the market will panic anddestroy the really strong confidence that the consumer has inthe economy," Seidman told reporters during the AmericanBankers Association annual convention.    But Seidman was relaxed about the implications for banks."I don't see any near-term effect on the banking system. Wewould have to worry if it throws the economy into a majorrecession. We don't expect that to happen." he said.    First Chicago Corp chairman Barry Sullivan echoed Seidman,saying that the slump in stocks could hasten a recession "if itsignificantly impacts consumer confidence."    But Sullivan told reporters that he thinks the U.S. economyremains sound.    Sullivan said the slide in stocks was an extreme reactionto recent increases in interest rates.    Asked whether First Chicago would follow Chemical Bank inraising its prime rate to 9-3/4 pct from 9-1/4, Sullivan said,"We're looking very carefully at the money markets."    The FDIC's Seidman, asked whether the stock market rout wasa reason to reconsider plans to give broader securities powersto commercial s, said, "Under the plan we are suggestingthat (securities) activities be done in subsidiaries so if everthings go badly for them it won't affect their capital."
