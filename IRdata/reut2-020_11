Tokyo Stock Exchange president MichioTakeuchi said the exchange has no immediate plans to suspendtrading to cool off panic stock selling.    However, he said Tokyo may consider such a measure if theLondon and New York exchanges are closed overnight.    "I don't think it will happen," he added.    He also told reporters the exchange will relax marginrequirements effective on Wednesday to encourage stock buying.    Takeuchi said the sharp fall in stock prices was mostly dueto psychological factors.    "We need to keep close watch on market movement but weexpect the market will stabilise soon," he said, adding thatindividual investors should remain calm. "It is advisable towait for an autonomous recovery of the market," he said.    The margin requirement in cash will be reduced to 50 pctfrom 70 pct while the margin collateral requirement in equitywill rise to 70 pct from 60 pct, effective on Wednesday, hesaid.    Takeuchi also said the exchange has no specific plan totake coordinated action with the New York and London exchangesto help stabilise stock prices.    The drop on Wall Street was caused by various factors butwas primarily the result of a correction of overvalued shareprices, he said. The current stock price plunge cannot comparewith the Great Depression as the economic environment is verydifferent, he added.    The exchange has not changed plans to introduce stockfutures trading next year despite press reports that the WallStreet fall was linked with futures trading, he said. REUTER&#3;
