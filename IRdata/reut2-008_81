Diversified investment company, &lt;AriadneAustralia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln sharesin the Philippine brewing firm &lt;San Miguel>, a Manila newspaperreported.    The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday toPresident Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New ZealanderBruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pctof the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from thegovernment.    The presidential office and Ariadne representatives inManila were not available for comment on the report.    The shares are the entire block seized by the governmentfrom the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion thatthe real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman ofSan Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed presidentFerdinand Marcos.    The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14mln class B shares.    Government officials have said earlier that the morevaluable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.    The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price atwhich the Philippine Social Security System suggested it mightbuy eight mln class A shares last week.    "Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of thePhilippines' yearly budget," Ariadne's Philippine agent DomingoPanganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.    "Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make hiscorporation's management expertise available to San Miguel sothat the company's assets can be fully utilised."    San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one ofthe major manufacturers of grocery lines.    Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tapfood and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, theU.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through &lt;Barwon Farmlands Ltd>,a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.    Ariadne, with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnoverof about two billion, has interests also in mining, real estateand agricultural products. REUTER&#3;
