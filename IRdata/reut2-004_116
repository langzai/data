The tin price is likely to rise to20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord onexport quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sellthe metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletinsaid.    The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers'interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnesoverhang.    It said consumption by industrialised countries should stayat 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditorsand brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessivelyunless there is a large and abrupt price jump.    The continued depreciation of the dollar could also helppush up the price of tin, the bulletin said.    A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of theringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tincheaper in sterling terms, it added.    "Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tinmarket, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure aprice recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said. REUTER&#3;
