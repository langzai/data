The Federal Reserve Boardunanimously approved a proposal to allow Federal Reserve banksto offer a redeposit service for bounced checks.    The service would allow a commercial bank that sends checksto a reserve bank for collection to instruct the reserve bankto redeposit a bounced check rather than return it.    The reserve banks would be required to charge a fee for theredeposit service that would cover its costs.    The plan would leave it to each reserve bank to set adollar cutoff for eligible returns.    The Fed acted after industry studies showed that nearlytwo-thirds of bounced checks cleared the second time around.    The Fed said studies show that fewer than one pct of themore than 40 billion checks written each year in the UnitedStates are returned unpaid.    Of those returned, about half are written for less than 100dlrs.    The Fed said many commercial banks already routinelyredeposit low-dlr-value checks returned to them forinsufficient funds.
