Texaco Inc's oil and gas reservesdeclined in 1986 despite reduced production and upwardrevisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, itsannual report said.    The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- aswas the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact ofthe judgement won by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> against Texaco oncharges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquireGetty Oil Co.    The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, thecompany's loss of any of several pending court decisions inthis case could cause it "to face prospects such as having toseek protection of its assets and business pursuant to thebankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11" of thefederal bankruptcy code.    Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reducedPennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by theappeals court no later than March 30.    Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the companyand its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrelsat the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.    However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the EasternHemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited thedecline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of1985.    Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiariesdeclined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 andupward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mlnbarrels from 117 mln, respectively.    Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the UnitedStates -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from1.55 billion.    The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, withabout 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day --representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed inresponse to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.
