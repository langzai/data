Brazilian Planning Minister Joao Sayadresigned, a presidential spokesman said.    His resignation was accepted during a meeting with President Jose Sarney this afternoon, the spokesman said.    No official reasons for the resignation were immediatelyavailable, but sources close to the government said Sayad hadpressed for a three-month price freeze and sharp governmentspending cuts to combat inflation.    Neither Sarney nor Finance Minister Dilson Funaro acceptedthe proposals, the sources said.    Sayad was one of the architects of last year's "PlanoCruzado" program, which froze prices, ended widespreadindexation of the economy and introduced the new cruzadocurrency to replace the cruzeiro in a bid to cut the 250 pctannual inflation rate.    After holding prices for nearly nine months, the plan wasunable to withstand the inflationary pressures of boomingconsumer demand and widespread shortages. In the first twomonths of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.    A sharp deterioration in Brazil's foreign trade surpluscaused President Sarney to announce last month the suspensionof interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercialdebt.    Finance Minister Funaro told reporters last week newmeasures to correct the economy would be announced within amonth, although he gave no further details.    Earlier today U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said Brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes toget additional assistance from commercial banks and others.    Sayad's resignation might foreshadow other changes in theBrazilian cabinet.    Presidential spokesman Frota Netto told journalists earliertoday the government was considering a suggestion by the Chiefof Civilian Staff at the Presidency Marco Maciel that a newmulti-party cabinet be formed to deal with the country'scurrent economic difficulties.
