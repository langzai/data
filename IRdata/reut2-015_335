The Agriculture Ministry declined commenton a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talkson its closed rice market in the new GATT round.    "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," aspokesman told Reuters.    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngand U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of itsintentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month forfarm talks.    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issueat the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradetalks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the FoodstuffControl Act.    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries aboutmounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japanwill try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy isjustified, it said.    The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay traderound last September. It will take four years to negotiate. REUTER&#3;
