New York cocoa traders reacted withcaution to today's developments at the International CocoaOrganization talks in London, saying there is still time fornegotiations to break down.    "I would be extremely cautious to go either long or shortat this point," said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa tradingfirm Barretto Peat. "If and when a final position comes out (ofthe ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions.The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possiblegain."    ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning acceptedthe outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules asa basis for further negotiation. A smaller group ofrepresentatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.    "Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would't put itany stronger than that," Ward said.    "It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement...but one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate," saidanother trader of today's developments.    Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiationsand have remained so, traders said.    "The dealers have got historically small positions inoutright terms," one trader said.    Speculators have gone net long "but only slightly so," headded.    The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs thelast two days -- has been due in large part to sterling's rallyagainst the dollar and in the process has attracted a measureof origin selling, traders said.
