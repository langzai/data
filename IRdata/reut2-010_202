White House Budget Director JamesMiller said a budget plan drafted by Senate Budget ChairmanLawton Chiles (D-Fla.) was "seriously deficient."    In a statement, Miller called the senator's proposal forthe government's fiscal 1988 budget would cut U.S. defensespending authority by more than 25 billion dlrs from PresidentReagan's request, resulting in a real reduction of militaryspending authority for the third year in a row.    While the plan would allow actual 1988 defense spending torise by 5.6 billion dlrs, domestic spending would be increasedby a disprportionate 42.7 billion dlrs, he said.    Miller also criticized the Chiles plan's call for a 13.6billion dlr tax increase.    "The president has said repeatedly that he would veto anytax increase," Miller said. Reuter&#3;
