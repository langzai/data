The Association of White Metals hasdecided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.    The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, wasintroduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems forsome French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metalsassociation said.    Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos andTuesday's at 4,790.    The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing atin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tintrading on October 24, 1985.    The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate aFrench franc price over the last few months to ensure it wasreliable, the spokesman said.    The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, aminimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railwaystation and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.
