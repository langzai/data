Soybean imports are forecast to rise to425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassysaid in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.    It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal ofself-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because itdid not meet a planned increase in area planted and becauseyields have remained below target.    Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000tonnes in 1985/86.    Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.    Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but torise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due tocome on stream in early 1988.    China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while theU.S. Provides the rest, it said.    "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 sincedomestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and arewilling to pay a premium for them," it said.    Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both1986/87 and 1987/88.    "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficientsupply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"the report said. REUTER&#3;
