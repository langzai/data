Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOBsometime this year because of better European demand and a fallin Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for treecrops, told Indonesian reporters.    Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.    Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despitemaking recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that itcould possibly increase its international market share.    Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oilafter Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensuresupplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.    Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporaryshortage than to lose export markets.    Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bankfigures. REUTER&#3;
