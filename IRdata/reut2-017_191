United Arab Emirates (UAE) CentralBank Governor Abdel Malik al-Hamar said any changes in the UAE"sexchange rate policy would be carried out in conjunction withother Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.    In a speech opening a seminar on Arab exchange ratepolicies, he noted the UAE had not changed the value of thedirham against the U.S. Dollar since 1980 despite widefluctuations in the latter"s value against other currencies.    "The exchange rate policy of the dirham has realised itsgoals in the past and changes in this policy depend oncoordination and cooperation with other GCC countries," he said.    The GCC states -- the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar,Oman and Kuwait -- have agreed in principle to link theircurrencies to a common grid.    Their currencies are now linked either to the dollar, IMFspecial drawing right (SDR) or, in the case of Kuwait, atrade-weighted basket of international currencies.    The UAE dirham can fluctuate within a band of 7.25 pcthigher or lower than 4.7619 to the SDR but has been fixed at3.671 to the dollar since November 1980. REUTER&#3;
