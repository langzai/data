Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase inthree years, partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate,the Nomura research institute said.    Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct inthe year, which starts April 1, the research arm of NomuraSecurities Co said in a statement.    Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in thecurrent fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.    The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to thedollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.    Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation, suchas cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit nextfiscal year, the institute said. The economy should alsobenefit from pump-priming expected from the government and ahalt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.    Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projectedto rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pctfall in the current year.
