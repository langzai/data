LTV Corp said it will seek approval fromthe U.S. bankruptcy court to make one-time hardship payments toretired steelworkers who lost some pension benefits when theirretirement plans were terminated.    The payments would range from 100 dlrs to 750 dlrs perperson for more than 9,800 steel company salaried and hourlyretirees, LTV said.    The company's steel unit retirement plans were terminatedin January by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, whichsaid the plans were insolvent.    LTV filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last July 17.    Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditorswhile it works out a plan to pay debts.    While most regular pension payments were continued afterLTV Steel Co's pension plans were terminated, some retirees gota reduction in their supplemental early retirement benefits orother payments that were more than maximums guaranteed by thefederal agency.    LTV also began talks with the United Steelworkers union,and both sides have made a commitment to reach a new laboragreement by May 1, the steel, aerospace and energy concernsaid.    LTV has the right to renegotiate its labor contracts whileoperating in Chapter 11. At issue are pension and healthbenefits for active and retired employees and other items, suchas use of manpower and equipment.    The company plans to present a comprehensive proposal tothe U.S. bankruptcy court in May to deal with pensions andhealth care benefits for steel and energy retirees and healthcare benefits for aerospace retirees, it said.
