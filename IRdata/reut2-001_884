The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct againstthe dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding attoday's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said.The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 lastweek.    Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold,with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.    The effective rate, including a central bank levy, fortransactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 lastweek.    The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to thecentral bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks aspunishment for inadequate documentation in previoustransactions.    Banks are required to submit proof that their bids arebased on valid commercial transactions and the central bank hascomplained in the past that many are failing to produce theright paperwork within the specified time.
