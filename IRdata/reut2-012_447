Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale&lt;WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLBInternational SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.    WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend toWestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the recordprofit of the previous year could not be repeated, due tochanged market conditions, it said. Increased funds were alsoallocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of1987 developed positively, it added.    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks forinternational credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in thebalance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mlnin 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact thatcredit business redemptions were not fully offset by newlending.    The statement said WestLB International's business withprivate customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.    This development was aided by cooperation between the bankand the savings banks in the West German state of NorthRhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.    Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of1.1 billion.    WestLB International said it plans to expand its range ofservices for private clients. REUTER&#3;
