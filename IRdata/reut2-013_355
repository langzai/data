Cocoa futures were about unchanged fromlast night by midmorning with near July trading at 1,319 stgfrom 1,318 asked and a 1,324/1,318 high-low.    Sterling's strength together with continued availability ofWest African new crop physical offerings more than outweighedany bullish impact from last night's higher New York market.    Dealers said the market had been forecast to open as muchas 10 stg up, basis New York's close.    The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1,325French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was there at around1,460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar, they said.    Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in thenear future, the only other bullish feature is the lower tradeforecast for Bahia's temporao crop which was recently reducedto 1.5/2.0 mln bags from 2.0/2.5 previously and compared withinitial expectations of up to three mln bags.    Dealers said trade ideas are now pointing to the lower endof the new forecast range although in terms of world productionthis may well be evened out by a better than expected IvoryCoast mid-crop.    Terminal volume after 75 minutes was 248 lots including 76lots crossed. REUTER&#3;
