Following is the full text of FederalReserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's letter to PresidentReagan declining reappointment to the Fed:    Dear Mr. President,    As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal ReserveBoard approaches, you naturally have to consider an appropriatenew appointment.       In that connection, you will recall that, upon myreappointment as chairman in 1983, I felt unable to make a firmcommitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for asecond full four-year term. Despite my reservations at thetime, that term is in fact now almost finished. However, I dothink, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has nowcome for me to return to private life as soon as reasonablyconvenient and consistent with an orderly transition.Consequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and Iplan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared toassume office.       I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation foryour unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly, yourconsistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during aparticularly challenging period for it, for the financialsystem, and for the economy has been critical to whateversuccess we have had.       Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of thoseinvolved in economic policy. In that effort, I believe thenation will continue to be well served by a strong FederalReserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fosteringeconomic and financial strength and stability and able to bringto that effort a combination of sound and independentprofessional judgement and continuity beyond any partisanconsiderations.       May I add, too, my personal best wishes for the remainderof your own term in office during which you have done so muchto restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among theAmerican people.    Faithfully yours,    Paul A Volcker Reuter&#3;
