Standard and Poor's Corp said itexpects downgrades of corporate debt ratings to ease this yearfrom the lofty levels of 1986 and 1985.    However, the rating agency said upgrades will probably stayat about the same level as in the past few years.    The narrowing of the gap between downgrades and upgradeswould reflect a calming in takeover frenzy, less volatileenergy markets and slow but steady economic growth, S and Psaid.    In particular, S and P expects that the industrial andbanking sectors would have a less turbulent year than in 1986.    S and P noted that 60 pct of 1986's downgrades wereconcentrated in the industrial sector, where the most negativefactor was takeover fever that led to debt-financed mergers andacquisitions and costly defenses to fend off takeovers.    It said takeovers appear to be on the decline this year.    While S and P noted that the energy markets have stabilizedafter last year's collapse, it stressed that 1987 would notmark a turnaround for this industry.    In addition, S and P does not expect any big shocks to hitthe junk bond market this year, especially of the magnitude of1986's unexpected LTV Corp &lt;LTV> bankruptcy filing.    Utilities, which were a positive influence in the overall1986 trend, should be a pocket of strength again this year. Butlike last year, gas utilities could buck this trend, S and Psaid.    The rating agency said that downgrades would continue tooutpace upgrades among financial institutions. But 1987'srating changes will not be as skewed as 1986's 2.1 to one ratioof downgrades to upgrades, S and P predicted.    S and P said debt ratings for the transportation industrywould remain stable, aside from changes because of mergers. Adetailed report will appear in the March 9 S/P Creditweek. Reuter&#3;
