A majority of Australianmanufacturers expect a deterioration in the business climate,according to the March survey of industrial trends by WestpacBanking Corp and the Confederation of Australian Industry.    After expecting improvements in two previous quarterlysurveys, 56 pct of respondents reported working at less thansatisfactory levels, with insufficient orders nominated by 70pct as the major constraint.    Other constraints were capacity, 11 pct, and labour ninepct, the survey said.    Inflationary pressure increased during the quarter andinvestment plans for the next year were scaled down, which thesurvey said could limit activity in the medium to short term.    Respondents reporting an increase in orders fell to 22 pctin March from 30 pct in December, while those with ordersaccepted but not yet delivered fell to 14 pct from 21 pct.    Stocks of finished goods and raw materials fell sharply inthe March quarter and further depletion was forecast for theJune quarter, the survey said.    Respondents said finance was harder to obtain, whichWestpac chief economist Bob Graham said was probably because ofhigh interest rates rather than the availability of money.    Graham said he thought expectations would gradually improvelater this year, when the dollar might consolidate and interestrates ease slightly.    He believed some manufacturers were not investing becausethey feared the Australian dollar would get stronger.    "We do not believe the dollar will revalue, the (economic)fundamentals are for it to slip away if anything," he said. REUTER&#3;
