Vietnam's parliament sacked PrimeMinister Pham Van Dong and President Truong Chinh, but thechoice of their successors indicated the influence of the oldguard may not be over, diplomatic sources said.    Dong, prime minister for 32 years, left in fading health atthe age of 81. He is a popular hero of wars against France andthe United States and a staunch ally of the Soviet Union.    Parliament replaced him with second-ranked politburo memberPham Hung, 74, the Vietnam News Agency said. Hung headed theViet Cong guerrillas in the Vietnam War.    Diplomats in Bangkok said Hung, not a noted supporter ofeconomic and political reforms, had been widely tipped for theless important presidency.    That post went instead to Vo Chi Cong, a technocrat whoranks third in the politburo. Diplomatic sources said Cong wasmore in tune with the national economic and political changesbeing pushed by reformists who apparently had gained the upperhand in the all-important politburo in December.    Chinh, a hardline Marxist and a veteran of the wars againstFrance and the U.S., Was ousted at the age of 80. His politicalstance had recently softened, the sources said. REUTER&#3;
