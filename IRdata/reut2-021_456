The Soviet Union's industrial output isgrowing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign tradehas fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda showindustrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2pct.    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billionroubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introductionof a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Lastyear's calculations of industrial output included all goods,irrespective of quality.    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, specialinspectors have the right to reject goods they consider belowstandard.    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods wererejected in the nine-month period.    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were morethan 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of theeconomy has been an important part of the modernisationcampaign, with measures introduced recently to allow thesetting up of small shops on a private basis.    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine monthsagainst 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivityfigures with caution, as they are more broadly based than inthe West, which measures worker output over a given period.    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Unionas of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same periodlast year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against194 roubles a year ago. REUTER&#3;
