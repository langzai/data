Japan was ready to use diplomacy to helpmaintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone said.    But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines ofcommunication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to takea broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministrysaid Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran andIraq, which have been at war since September 1980.    Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financialhelp to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan'scrude oil passes through the waterway.    President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes inthe Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agendafor next week's G-7 summit in Venice.    Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step upits naval presence in the Gulf despite congressionalexpressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to helpmaintain freedom of navigation.    Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from beingdeployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washingtonunderstands this problem. REUTER&#3;
