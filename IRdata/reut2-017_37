A large group of "other milds"coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next monthto map their strategy for next September's meeting of theInternational Coffee Organisation (ICO).    Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Ricancoffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the DominicanRepublic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and fivecentral american nations will participate in the two-daystrategy session beginning May 4.    The main topic will be reform of what many producingcountries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of exportquotas, Fernandez said.    He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on thereal production and export potential of each country in thepast few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic"production levels rather than recent harvests and cropestimates.
