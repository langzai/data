Canada's corporate debt burden is at itslowest point in five years but still exceeds pre-1981 recessionlevels, said a study by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce&lt;CM.TO>.    The bank said the debt-equity ratio for all Canadiancompanies, excluding financial corporations, now averages 1.50,down from 1.70 in 1982, but higher than 1.47 in 1980.    "Five years of uninterrupted economic growth in Canada andthe strength of the Canadian bond and stock markets, despiterecent corrections, have led to a marked improvement in thefinancial health of most Canadian corporations," the bank said.       The bank said that manufacturing, construction,transportation, utility and service industries had improvedtheir debt-equity ratios to 1977 levels. Mining, oil and gascompanies were not performing as well due to low commodityprices, the bank added.    Canadian corporate financial ratios are also stronger thanthose in the U.S., the bank said. It said the 1981-82 recessionled some Canadian companies to downsize and use resultingsavings to cut floating rate debt, and others to shift toequity from debt financing.
