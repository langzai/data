The USSR will hold local councilelections on June 21 at which voters in some districts willhave a choice of candidates as part of an experiment inelectoral reform, the Tass News Agency said.    The official agency said yesterday the selected districts,still to be chosen, would have a slate of several candidates,not all of whom could be elected, and voters would strike outthe names of those they did not support.    Tass said candidates would have to win support from morethan 50 pct of registered constituents to win seats.    Voting is compulsory in the Soviet Union.    In the past, official returns for elections at most levelsin the Soviet government system have recorded 99 to 100 pctsupport for all candidates. Voters simply dropped the officialballot paper with the single candidate's name into an urn.    Tass said districts chosen for the experiment would returnseveral deputies rather than a single representative to localcouncil bodies.    The announcement followed pledges on electoral reform bySoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, campaigning to revitaliseconfidence in the communist system after what he has describedas a period of stagnation.
