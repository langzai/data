The former chief offoreign exchange at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> has been arrested inconnection with a scandal which may have cost the car maker aquarter of a billion dlrs, the chief state prosecutor CarlHermann Retemeyer said.    He told Reuters that Burkhard "Bobby" Junger was arrestedyesterday for suspected embezzlement.    "There is reason to believe that Junger could have evadedjustice, and investigating magistrates therefore asked for hisarrest," Retemeyer said.    VW fired Junger in March, after news emerged of thesuspected foreign exchange swindle. In January the board gavehim leave of absence. Six other people have been suspended.    VW said last month computer programs were erased anddocuments faked in the possible fraud, in which it believestransactions meant to protect it against foreign currencylosses were not completed.    Retemeyer said "We are still investigating a larger circleof people, among them Frankfurt currency dealers"    He would not comment whether other arrests could beexpected.    The possible fraud resulted in a major management shake-upwith the resignation of Rolf Selowsky, management board memberin charge of finance, who assumed managerial responsibility forthe affair.    Retemeyer said last month he wanted to questionFrankfurt-based money broker Joachim Schmidt, who may be ableto give more details. REUTER&#3;
