President Desmond Hoyte said recentreports of widespread thallium sulphate poisoning in Guyanawere mischievous and had gravely damaged the country's foodexports.    "There is no thallium sulphate poisoning epidemic in Guyana,as has been rumored," Hoyte said in a radio address late Sunday.    Reports of a spate of poisonings from the chemical had ledsome newspapers in the Caribbean to call for a ban on foodexports from Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago had restrictedimports of Guyanese rice, Hoyte said.    Thallium sulphate, banned in many countries and blacklistedsince 1973 by the World Health Organization as a deadlychemical, has been used by Guyana's state sugar corporation asa rodent poison.    Calling the reports a "mischievous invention," Hoyte saidtests had shown some of Guyana's main exports, such as wheatand flour, were not contaminated.    Hoyte based his statements on tests conducted by the WHOand the Pan American Health Organization, which found onlyseven cases of thallium sulphate poisoning thus far. Reuter&#3;
