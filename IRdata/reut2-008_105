Iran said reports that it intended tothreaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned theU.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region.    Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a ForeignMinistry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference wouldbe met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in theworld."     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarksapparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would dowhatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the faceof new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.    The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had beentold of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed athreat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.    U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-madeanti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat tomerchant ships than missiles used before.    The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intendedto attack ships were "misleading propaganda."    He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main causeof tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "allits legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."    Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "Weare fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shippinggoing and keep the freedom of navigation available in that veryvital waterway."    "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of whatmight happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to andlistening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance inkeeping navigation free in that area," he said.    Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area werenot unusual.    A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier KittyHawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.    The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as sayingthe U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in theregion. REUTER&#3;
