Dwindling global crude oil reserves andthe lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will sendthe world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former AtlanticRichfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.    "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Andersontold reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "Ibelieve we're going to see a change in the world oil markets intwo to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oiland Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mlnbarrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.    "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape upone mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the MiddleEast," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where wewere in 1973 and 1979."    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 atabout 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.    "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn'tenough supply," he said. "There have been no major oildiscoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major worlddiscovery, has already produced about five billion barrels ofoil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said. Reuter&#3;
