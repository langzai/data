Argentine Economy Minister JuanSourrouille left at the weekend for the United States for talkswith creditor banks and the IMF aimed at obtaining the releaseof new loans, the semi-official news agency Telam said.    It said Sourrouille would urge the IMF to release a 480 mlndlrs compensatory loan for falling exports as well as the firsttwo tranches of a standby loan, totalling 450 mln dlrs.    Release of the funds from the standby loan has been delayedby Argentina's failure to win final approval to a 1.95 billiondlr loan from creditor banks, which was a condition for the IMFdisbursement.    Banks have pledged 97 pct of the 1.95 billion dlr loan butthe IMF has not yet defined what amount constitutes the"critical mass," which is needed for release of the IMF funds andthe funds from creditor banks.    The president of Argentina's bank steering committee,William Rhodes of Citibank, said on Friday he thought the loanagreement with Argentina could be signed in August. Reuter&#3;
