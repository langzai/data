FW Woolworth Co's chairman and chiefexecutive officer, Harold Sells, said the company remainscommmitted to its general merchandise division, despite thegrowing importance of its specialty stores.    The company said its sales in the first quarter ended May 2were 1.53 billion dlrs, up from 1.41 billion dlrs in the sameperiod last year.       Sells said the company's specialty stores contributed 65pct to total operating profit last year, but profits in thegeneral merchandise sector have been improving. He said thecompany has no plans to turn its back on the Woolworth stores.    "We've spent alot of money on refurbishing and remodelingour general merchandise stores, and we will continue to do so,"he said.    Sells said the number of general merchandise stores is notincreasing. But one of the companies stratagies is to increaseits core departments in the general merchandise stores intospecialty stores, he said.    He said these include its framescene and cosmetics unit.    He said the company continues to look at mergers andacquisitions. But he stressed any acquisitions should makesense from a strategy standpoint.    "We're primarily looking for small, emerging growth storeswith a concept that's right to expand on national scale," hesaid.      Sells said the company has been looking at a number ofinitial experiments on home video sales. He said Woolworth willbecome involved this summer with J.C. Penny Co Inc's &lt;JCP>Tele-Action program, along with a number of other retailers.    Sells said the Tele-Action program, which is due to go onair in the Chicago area this summer, will feature products fromWoolworth's Foot Locker unit. Reuter&#3;
