China must cut excess demand and capitalinvestment in the face of budget and foreign exchange deficitsbut will press ahead with wide-ranging economic reforms in1987, Premier Zhao Ziyang told parliament.    Zhao told the annual meeting of the National People'sCongress that while China cooled its overheated economy, cutits trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986,serious imbalances remain.    Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, anddemand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is toohigh. "(They) squander public funds to a serious extent ... (andissue) excessive wage and bonus increases," he said.    Failure to cut this excess will "result in reducedaccumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality,"Zhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low percapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for constructionin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumptionmust match the available resources, he said.    Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising costof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced incomefrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.    Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and rawand semi-finished materials industries is inadequate andinvestment in non-productive projects is too large, he said. Reuter&#3;
