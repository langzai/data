The public offer by Glaverbel SA,Europe's third biggest glassmaker, of 755,000 shares was morethan 100 times oversubscribed, a statement by banks and sharedealers responsible for the issue said.    Glaverbel offered the shares at 1,850 francs in anoperation under which its parent company, Asahi Glass Ltd&lt;ASGL.T> will reduce its participation to 56.7 pct from 73.6pct previously.    Asahi is selling 500,000 shares in Glaverbel while thecompany itself is issuing 340,000 new shares. Over 10 pct ofthe total available shares has been reserved for staff.    The statement said applicants for over 5,000 shares willreceive 30. There is a sliding scale which gives relativelymodest applications a higher proportion and those who soughtbetween 101 and 500 shares will receive five. No shares will begiven to applicants for fewer than 100 shares.    Glaverbel's net consolidated profit rose to 542 mln francslast year from 137 mln in 1985 and the group is to pay a 29franc gross dividend, its first for over 10 years.    As a result of the offer, some 45 pct of Glaverbel'scapital, or two mln shares, will be listed on the Brusselsbourse.    Share dealers said some of the weakness on the bourserecently probably has been due to the amount of money tied upin Glaverbel applications. REUTER&#3;
