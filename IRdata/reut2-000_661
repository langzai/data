U.S. electronic companies'sales last year totalled 226.5 billion dlrs, slightly below the228.7 billion dlrs reported in 1985, the American ElectronicAssociation said.    Despite the decline, the fourth-quarter total of 61.1billion dlrs matched the industry record for the same period of1984, the AEA said.    AEA senior vice president Ralph Thomson said that, althoughthe 1986 sales trend was mostly positive with an upturn at theend of the year, the industry is waiting early 1987 figuresbefore trying to forecast the future.    "Many of our companies, including the semiconductor sector,are still being impacted by the enormous and growing tradedeficit with Japan," he said.    Fourth-quarter orders totalled 60 billion dlrs for a 3.1pct increase over the same quarter of 1985. December sales were22.2 billion dlrs, up 2.8 pct from the same month in 1985.    The association represents more than 2,800 firms thatproduce electronic goods and services. Reuter&#3;
