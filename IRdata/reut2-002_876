Hundreds of marines were on alertat 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remainon indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Courtyesterday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,started on February 27, and union leaders said they would notreturn to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipownershave offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.    "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off theworkers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with ourprotest until the end," a union leader said.    He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marinestake over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels andlet the marines handle the situation by themselves.    A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order tosend marines to take over the ports was given by Navy MinisterHenrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of nationalsecurity. But he said there were no incidents. The strike hascut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.    Petrol station owners in four states also continued theirshutdown and there were fears that the combination of the twostoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. REUTER&#3;
