The Federation of Bankers' Associations ofJapan released its proposal for early creation of acomprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.    The market should include a comprehensive range of futuresand options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real globalmoney centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments isavailable, the proposal said.    It should provide currency and interest rate futures, andincorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stockindex futures contracts.    The proposal said transactions in all these contracts mustbe conducted on the same market so participants can readilyengage in arbitrage between various financial instruments.    To make this possible, the proposal calls for newlegislation which would administer all related futures andoptions transactions under the same legal framework.    Banking sources said they expect that initially thecurrency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures wouldinclude Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit,three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasurybonds.    Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki assaying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possiblebecause it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan'sfinancial markets.    Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospectivemarket participants to banks but was willing to accept thosefrom wider business circles, the sources said.    Japan's only current financial futures market, in yenbonds, began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985.    But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures tradingin a basket of leading stocks in April. REUTER&#3;
