"We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S.trade official.    One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear tomember states and to the EC commission that if Brusselsproceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a greatcost."    U.S. officials said no formal list of European products onwhich the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up.    "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one tradeofficial, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations onits farm price package.
