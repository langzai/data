Morgan Guaranty Trust Co said it filedsuit against &lt;Metromedia Inc>, seeking a redemption at par ofMetromedia subordinated discount debentures.    The debentures due 1998, were issued in 1984 and were zerocoupon notes for the first five years. Beginning 1990, theywere to receive semi-annual interest payments at an annual rateof 16 pct.    Morgan said the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court forthe Southern District of New York, stems from the recentvoluntary liquidation of Metromedia which has intentionallycreated an event of default on the notes.     The company said the default amount is 574.24 dlrs for each1,000 dlrs principal amount of debentures. The figure takesinto account the deep discount the holders received when theybought the issue.    Morgan Guaranty said there is about 30 mln dlrs principaloutstanding. Reuter&#3;
