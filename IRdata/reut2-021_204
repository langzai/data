Peripheral Systems Inc said itcompleted tests of the Nucell-50 radio isotope generatingsystem, known as a resonant nuclear battery, designed toproduce up to 50 kilowatts of AC electricity.    The Nucell-50, developed by privately-held &lt;Nucell Inc>,converts the natural decay of radioactive materials directlyinto electricity whout a nuclear reaction or fission process,the company said.    Peripheral said it entered into a previously announcedagreement to acquire Nucell, subject to shareholder approval,and has been providing research funds and engineering to it.    The merger calls for an unspecified amount of stock to bepaid for Nucell, the company said.    The Nucell-50 unit, which measures 12 inches by 15 inchesand weighs less than 50 pounds, can operate continuously formany years, the company said.    The device uses a small amount of radioactive material,which can be shielded for consumer use, the company said.    Initial funding of the Nucell research and development wasprovided by individuals, many of whom were officers anddirectors of Peripheral, the company said. Reuter&#3;
