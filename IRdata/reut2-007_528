U.K building society net receipts inFebruary were 472 mln stg, slightly up on January's 456 mln butwell below the 793 mln stg of February 1986, the BuildingSocieties' Association (BSA) said.    BSA Secretary-General Mark Boleat noted that net receiptswere below 500 mln stg for the third month out of the lastfour.    "This was obviously a disappointing performance, especiallyin view of the rapid growth of mortgage commitments, to over2.5 billion stg," he said.    The BSA said receipts were depressed by the British Airwaysflotation, despite the later return of oversubscribed funds.    Total building society receipts in February were 6.4billion stg against withdrawals of 5.9 billion.    Mortgage lending to home buyers during the month fellslightly to 2.16 billion stg from 2.18 billion stg in January,the BSA said. Mortgage lending has fallen steadily since lastJuly's peak of 3.9 billion stg.    Net new mortgage commitments however rose to 2.5 billionstg from January's 1.9 billion, bringing the total commitmentsoutstanding to 6.9 billion after January's 6.6 billion stg.    Wholesale funding rose to 292 mln stg after January's 29mln, but was still below each of the last six 1986 months. REUTER&#3;
