House Energy and Commerce committeechairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said the Securities and ExchangeCommission should step up its enforcement of regulations whichrequire companies to disclose corporate fraud and waste.    Dingell made the comment at the start of a hearing onalleged overcharges by TRW Inc on its defense contracts.    He said the SEC seemed to have stopped demanding suchdisclosures, which are required by securities laws.    "In the wake of the foreign bribery cases in the 1970s, theSEC instituted a vigorous program of self-policing, usingexternal auditors, investigators, and counsel. It should do soagain," Dingell said.
