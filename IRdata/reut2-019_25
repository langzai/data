U.S. Secretary of State George Shultzwarned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to theU.S. For growth.    "Given the importance of exports, particularly exportmanufactures, to all of your countries, you are going to haveto work hard to diversify your markets," he said.    "While you may be able to maintain your current market sharein the U.S., You clearly will not be able to look to the U.S.To take major increases in your exports," he added.    Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia,Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S.Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than manynow believed.    He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would notnecessarily stem from protectionist legislation now beingcontemplated by Congress, "but simply because of the adjustmentsthe U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service ourlarge and growing external debt."    Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from fallingexports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth. REUTER&#3;
