Brazil's motor industry, facing theworst crisis of its history, today sent thousands of workers oncollective leave because of a sharp drop in demand.    Company spokesmen said Autolatina, which last Friday laidoff 4,000 workers, sent nearly 9,000 of its 56,500 employees inBrazil on collective leave until July 12.    General Motors do Brasil said it would give 10 days' leaveto part of its 22,000 workforce from Wednesday.    Fiat is giving 2,000 workers a month's holiday from July 6.    Jacy Mendonca, industrial relations director of Autolatina,a merger of Volkswagen and Ford in Brazil and Argentina, saidlast week this would be the worst year ever for Brazil's autoindustry.    He forecast that 1987 would be worse than 1981, whendomestic sales dropped 40 pct to 580,000 units.    "This year we'll be lucky if we can sell 550,000 units," hesaid.    Since Friday there have been two positive developments forthe industry. The government announced that it was scrapping a15 pct surcharge on all new car sales.    The surcharge, created in July last year, was originallyset at 30 pct to help curb a car-buying boom and was in theoryrefundable.    Brazilian car distributors, which since June 16 had haltedall car purchases in protest against high government taxes,responded to the government move by resuming purchases.    But industry spokesmen said taxes on vehicles were stillhigh, 108 pct, and the sector still faced major problems. Reuter&#3;
