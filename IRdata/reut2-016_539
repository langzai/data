Nova, an Alberta Corp, chief executiveRobert Blair expressed hope that Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP>remains under Canadian ownership, but added that his companyplans no bid of its own for debt-troubled Dome.    "We've no plan to bid," Blair told reporters after a speechto a business group, although he stressed that Nova and 57pct-owned Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO> were interested in Dome'sextensive Western Canadian energy holdings.    "But being interested can sometimes be different frommaking a bid," Blair said.    TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP> yesterday bid 4.30 billiondlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks withTransCanada and was considering a proposal from another companyand was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumoredto be offshore.    Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands,Blair replied, "Yes. I think that we still need to be buildingas much Canadian position in this industry as we can and Ithink it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadianmanagement."    He said he did not know who other possible bidders were.    Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house inorder "will remove one of the general problems of attitude thathave hung over Western Canadian industry."    He added, however, that the energy industry still faced "acouple of tough, tough additional years."    Asked about Nova's 1987 prospects, Blair predicted thatNova's net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mlndlrs from last year's net profit of 100.2 mln dlrs due toimproved product prices and continued cost-cutting.
