OPEC output for the second half of 1987,including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mlnbarrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.    Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained itsceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quartersof 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarterlevel of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quartertarget.    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC thirdquarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd whilefourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these productionlevels would have on prices.    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused toadhere to it and has recently been producing around two mlnbarrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabiaand Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted whena 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in aboutSeptember.    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf Warenemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369mln in the second half.    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production fromthe Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which hasbeen supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We willnot discuss it. There will not be any change," he said.    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and endedSaturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problemsto be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short ameeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said.    Ali said the problem of price differentials between theprices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properlyat the meeting.    Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. Iwould hate to be producing today a light crude and that problemhas not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpricedrelative to heavy crudes."    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at thenext OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not dothe work of another minister."    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spreadof 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.        Reuter&#3;
