International monetary officials will rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in theLouvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollarfree-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,economists and currency traders said.    "I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks upin an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of thedollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,"said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.       In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretaryJames Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West Germanmoney market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact tofoster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.    His comments rocked the currency markets and helped sendthe already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into atailspin.    The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen.
