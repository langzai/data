International Business Machines Corpsaid scientists at its Zurich research laboratory have taken akey step toward developing a method of testing computer chipswith a laser.    The technique is important, IBM said, because it could leadto the development of tools that can determine the quality ofmicroscopic-sized computer chips without damaging them.    IBM said chip makers will need such advanced testingmethods to aid them in developing the next generation ofsemiconductors.    These chips will be smaller than today's chips but will beable to store vastly greater amounts of information.    IBM said its technique uses a laser light for "contactless"measuring of electrical signals on metal lines similar to thekind found in computer chip circuitry.    It said that using commercially available lasers, themethod should permit measurements of circuits with a width ofone micrometer or less.    A micrometer is about 80 times smaller than the thicknessof a sheet of paper. Reuter&#3;
