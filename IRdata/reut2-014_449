The State of Texas, faced with a record5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, mayhave to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said.     Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back whenthe state's enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easilyallowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporateincome tax.     However, last year's dramatic slump in oil prices not onlysent the Texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily intothe state's tax revenues.    Both Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's cuttheir credit ratings of the state to double A from the toptriple A in early March.    Moody's Vice President George W. Leung said it was thefirst time Texas' rating had been lowered since 1962, addingthe report noted that while "the Legislature is now consideringproposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects forfull recovery are weak."    With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by StateComptroller Bob Bullock, the Texas Legislature must grapplewith a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 4.8billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. No otherstate in U.S. history has faced such a deficit.    "There is a strong independent streak in Texans and fiveyears ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislaturewould institute an income tax," said George Bland, AssistantProfessor of Political Science at North Texas State University,adding, "Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me it'scoming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time."     State taxes on oil and gas production traditionallysupplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.    However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recentyears, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependenceon sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.     Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a majorfactor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes areno longer deductible from federal income tax while state incometax is.    John Kennedy, senior research associate at the Austin-basedTexas Research League said, "There is a great deal of popularsentiment against it, plus the first plank of GovernorClements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax."    However, he said that since the oil price fall the statefaced a choice of either instituting an income tax orbroadening and possibly raising the sales tax.    Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterpriseat Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes,said he favored reforming the present tax system to takeaccount of the changed structure of the economy.    "We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oiland agriculture and real estate and more on service industries,manufacturing and high-tech," Pejovich said.    Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullocksaid, "Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned theLegislature that if they get tired of looking at everythingelse, that's the only option."    Apart from Texas, states which have no individual incometax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota,Washington and Wyoming     For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruledthat the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlrdeficit into the next biennium, even though the stateconsitution requires a balanced budget. But as State TreasurerAnn Richards said last Thursday, "Jim Mattox's decision todayturns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must notthink that the goose isn't still cooking."    Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spendingcuts. But the state is already under pressure from a FederalDistrict Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system -- orface 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.    And U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett has accusedthe state, among others, of lax education reform. Earlier thisyear, both houses of the Legislature, citing financialrestraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoningplans to require teachers to take competency tests.    Bland said he believes the state will set up a commissionnext year to "study alternative revenue sources," with anincome tax being instituted as early as January 1989.    "If the political leaders are educated about (the effectsof the Tax Reform Act), I think there will be a gradual drifttoward income tax," he said.                 Reuter&#3;
