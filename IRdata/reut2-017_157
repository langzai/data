First Interstate Bank Corp ChairmanJoseph Pinola said he was not optimistic about the prospectsfor a resolution of the Brazilian debt situation during thecurrent year.    "I am not as optimistic personally on a resolution as someothers are," Pinola told reporters after the company's annualmeeting.    He said it did not seem likely that the Braziliangovernment has the will to take the steps necessary to resolvetheir domestic economic difficulties.       In February, Brazil suspended interest payment on about 68bln dlrs of its commercial debt. Many U.S. banks have placedtheir Brazilian loans on non-accrual status as a result of thisaction, but they also expressed confidence that Brazil and U.S.lenders could resolve the situation before the end of the year.
