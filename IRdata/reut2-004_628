Schweizerische Aluminimum AG &lt;ALUZ.Z>(Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansingits balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.    "The threshold of profitability has returned to theforeseeable future," he said. "We expect already in 1987approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, thatour industrial environment does not worsen."    He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of pastlosses.    Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.    Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion andnet turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.    Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for1985.    But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a newsconference the new management installed a year ago had decidedto restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminaterights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as anasset.    Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took angross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from472 mln in 1985.    It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiaryin the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in1985.    Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves andexceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.    Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radicalelimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said thefoundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.    Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity wasstrong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.    Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pctin 1985.    In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse hadarranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank ofSwitzerland &lt;SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z> and CreditSuisse &lt;CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into asubordinated loan.    The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and notcash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used onlyto a small extent, and the parent company had been granted anew credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swissbanks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.    Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintainingbauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.    That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc lossinstead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.    The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similaralternations were made for previous years.    After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895mln francs. REUTER&#3;
