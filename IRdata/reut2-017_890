Government tax revenues for the 1986/87 year ended March 31 were more than 600 billion yen higher thanforecast and could be used to help fund the economic packageannounced last week, Finance Ministry sources said.    The final figure for 1986/87 will not be available untilnext month, but some local newspapers speculated that thecarryover could be as much as 1,000 billion yen.    The government is due to introduce a supplementary budgetduring an extarordinary parliamentary session expected to startin July. The budget will be used to finance the centralgovernment share of last Friday's emergency economic package.    That package totalled more than 6,000 billion yen,including more than 1,000 billion in tax cuts.    Government officials including Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa have previously said possible revenue sources for taxcuts include the tax revenue carryover from 1986/87 andproceeds from the sale of shares in the privatized NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp.    The sale of 1.95 mln NTT shares in 1986/87 left about 450billion yen available for use as a revenue source for tax cuts,the sources said. Another 1.95 mln are expected to be sold inthe current fiscal year. REUTER&#3;
