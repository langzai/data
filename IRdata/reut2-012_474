South Africa's largest labourfederation has issued a broad call to the country's trade unionmovement to support thousands of striking black railway workersand criticised the state-owned rail company for threatening toreplace the strikers with whites.    Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of SouthAfrican Trade Unions (COSATU), which claims a membership ofover 600,000 workers, most of whom are black, urged labourunions to show solidarity with the striking railwaymen, addingthat a key issue in the strike was the freedom of workers tojoin trade unions of their choice.    Naidoo criticised the government-run South AfricanTransport Services (SATS) for refusing to recognise the SouthAfrican Railway and Harbours Workers Union, which representsmost of the strikers.    He also accused SATS of applying "racist labour policies," bythreatening to replace the strikers and added that thecorporation's decision had further "inflamed the dispute."    The strike began on March 14 when workers walked outfollowing the railway company's refusal to go to formalarbitration talks over the dismissal of a train driver.    SATS says that some 13,000 workers are involved in thestoppage, but union leaders put the number of strikers closerto 18,000.    The Cosatu official said a number of its affiliate unionshad resolved to "take solidarity action" and would inform SouthAfrica's Labour Minister of their decision. He also urged thecountry's two largest employer groups, the Association ofChambers of Commerce and the Federated Chamber of Industries,to intervene to resolve the strike. REUTER&#3;
