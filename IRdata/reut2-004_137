Southwest Realty Ltd said it believes itcould make all of its scheduled montly debt service paymentsfor 1987 despite the falloff in its rental operations, butmaking the payments would probably severely impair itsliquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality ofits properties.    The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1,544,000 dlrscompared with a 1985 profit of 3,912,000 dlrs.    Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debtservice payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houstonproperties is due to mature on April One.    Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate andextend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.    It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houstonproperties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, ifgranted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  Theloan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or otherlitigation connected with the specific properties involved andcould involve the suspension of interest and principal paymentsto some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts torestructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more ofthe properties.    Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pctof its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs pershare, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.    The company said depending on the success of the talks andoperating results for 1987, one or two more properties couldbecome subject to similar negotiations.  The two additionalproperties comprised about 11 pct of its current value equityat year-end, Southwest said. Reuter&#3;
