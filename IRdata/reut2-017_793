The Home Insurance Co, a unit of theHome Group Inc, said it is not affected by a May 29 Californiacourt ruling that says 20 insurance companies must bear thecosts of asbestos-injury claims.    The company said it had reached a settlement agreement withfive former asbestos manufacturers that it had insured, priorto the Superior Court ruling that said insurers, and notasbestos makers, would have to pay the claims from thethousands of victims of asbestos-related illnesses.    Home Insurance did not disclose the terms of thesettlement.       Home Insurance said it had provided excess coverage toManville Corp &lt;QMAN>, Armstrong World Industries &lt;ACK>,&lt;Fibreboard Inc>, GAF Corp &lt;GAF> and &lt;Nicolet Inc>.    Home Insurance said it had been negotiating for the pasttwo years to reach a settlement with the five former asbestosmanufacturers to establish the amount of coverage that HomeInsurance would provide in the claims.    The company said the settlement does not impact current orfuture earnings of the Home Insurance or its parent, HomeGroup, and that it will no longer offer insurance forasbestos-related incidents.
