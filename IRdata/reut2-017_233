President Jaime Lusinchi is preparingan economic package in response to demands from organisedlabour in Venezuela for a general wage increase and controls oninflation, the state news agency Venpres reported.    Venpres said the plan includes pay hikes and a "strategyagainst indiscriminate increases in prices or speculation."    The Venezuelan Workers Confederation (CTV), the country'slargest labour group, last week proposed a general wageincrease of between 10 and 30 pct and a six-month freeze onconsumer prices and on layoffs.    The CTV asked Lusinchi to respond to its proposal beforethe May 1 Workers' Day holiday.    Labour's demands comes as private economists forecastinflation will reach between 25 and 30 pct in 1987 as thecountry begins to feel the effects of the December devaluationof the bolivar by 100 pct against the dollar.    Inflation increased 4.2 pct in the first two months of1987, almost double the rate in the same 1986 period.    Venpres said Lusinchi is prepared to approve some priceincreases, but intends to protect the public againstspeculation and indiscriminate hikes in the cost of living. REUTER&#3;
