Alleghney said the suit, filed in the U.S. District Courtfor the Western District of Pennsylvania, was aimed at blockingthe sale of Alleghney to an affiliate of First Boston Inc.    Allegheney said the additional count sought by theplaintiffs alleges the price to be offered for AI's commonstock, 24.60 dlrs, is grossly unfair and one the purposes ofthe proposed sale is to absolve the individual defendants ofliability in the lawsuit.     The additional count among other forms of relief, requestsan injunction against the defendants from taking any steps toaccomplish the proposed sale, Alleghney said. Reuter&#3;
