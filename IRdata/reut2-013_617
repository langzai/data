State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls RoycePlc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow withmany analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it islikely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;AirbusIndustrie> A340 aircraft.    The company's so-called "pathfinder prospectus" gives all thedetails of its stock market flotation except for the price atwhich shares will be offered.    Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rosein 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.    Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profitfor 1987.    Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profitsand a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rollsoperated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.    Assuming the company was valued at around eight timesearnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of theaerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.    BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.    The price will be increased by it being likely to have muchof its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure thecompany's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls wasrescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.    When the government announced the sale, it said it wouldinject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.    Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a creditrating to match those of its main competitors such as GeneralElectric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Prattand Whitney unit.
