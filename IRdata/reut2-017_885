The International Primary MarketAssociation's new rules for lead managers of fixed rate dollarbonds will take effect on June 15, an IPMA official said.    The new IPMA rules require a lead manager to quote firmprices at which it will buy and sell newly issued bonds for 12months after the launch. The rules were first proposed March27.    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, said therules are not expected to have a noticeable impact on themarket because they only apply to dollar denominated bonds,which have been scarce recently.    This year, euroyen issuance has outstripped dollar bonds.    Sibson said that the rules are intended to provide greaterliquidity in the new issues market where underwriters sometimesstep away from deals they have managed if the market moves awayfrom them.    However, he noted that the IPMA rules are voluntary and theorganization has no authority to enforce them.    Sibson said that similar rules for new issues denominatedin other currencies will be put into effect later, followingconsultation with the Association of International BondDealers, another trade organization.
