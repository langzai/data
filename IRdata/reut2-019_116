OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukmansaid he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to bebrief and calm and that OPEC's current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review.    "I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,"Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters hereahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, whichstarts June 25.    "We already have an agreement which may need only a slightreview," Lukman said.    The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministersin December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18dlrs a barrel.    Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December tojust above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analystsfirmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreementto keep the market stable.    "I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position tostrengthen the gains we have made so far," Lukman said.    He declined to say if the current ceiling should bemaintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.    "Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by ourcollective will to keep the market strong," he said.    He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeksago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and thiswas significant for its members.    Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this yearwhen OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and arestocking now for the winter was responsible for currentmarket strength. Reuter&#3;
