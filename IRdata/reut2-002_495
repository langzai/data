U.S. money supply growth is slowingdown rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of theFederal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even havecontracted in February.    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for theFed, especially as it would follow a long period of torridgrowth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in theweeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policywas justified on account of weakness in the economy.        M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reportedtoday, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminaryforecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.With other components of M-2, such as money-market depositaccounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage isset for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditionallink to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact offalling interest rates and banking deregulation.    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates islikely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill LynchEconomics Inc.    "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're allsending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrowsat the Fed," McCarthy said.    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "Wehave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It'scoming in a lot weaker than I thought."        The economists were quick to caution that one month's dataprove nothing, especially because money growth previously hadbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pctrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably beexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into thebooming stock market and is thus not an indication of aslowdown in the business expansion.    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bondmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly areflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides withsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarterprogresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy asthey were a month ago," he noted.    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March andrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pctor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderateenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross nationalproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'dcertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balancesheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already underway, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in linewith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Incargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much tosolve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive tradedeficit. Because of the possibility that further dollardepreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed toclose the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be allthat optimistic about the bond market."
