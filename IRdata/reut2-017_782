Moody's Investors Service Inc said itaffirmed about four billion dlrs of long-term debt of MiddleSouth Utilities and nearly all of its units.    Moody's cited the U.S. Supreme Court's stay of an adverseMisssissippi Supreme Court ruling for a Middle South unit,Mississippi Power and Light Co. The approval of the stay mayenhance Mississippi Power's prospects for a favorable judgment,Moody's added.    But Moody's said it will watch the situation closelybecause the stay depends on a bond posting that is satisfactoryto the Mississippi Supreme Court.    On May 26, the Mississippi Public Service Commissionordered Mississippi Power to stop collecting about 12 mln dlrsin monthly revenues from its Grand Gulf power plant, Moody'spointed out. The Commission also wants Mississippi Power tosubmit a plan for refunding 190 mln dlrs of previouslycollected funds, Moody's said.    The first mortgage bonds and secured pollution controlbonds of Mississippi Power, Arkansas Power and Louisiana Powerand Light Co were affirmed at Baa-1. Their preferred stock wasaffirmed at Baa-2.
