Dutch public authorities are on courseto meet the 1987 public sector deficit target of 7.9 pct of netnational income (NNI) despite excess spending by the centralgovernment, according to a leaked official report.    The so-called Spring Report, giving latest revenue andexpenditure figures and to be discussed by the Dutch cabinettoday, was leaked in advance to the Dutch press. The DutchFinance Ministry declined to comment on the press reports.    Newspapers quoted the report, drafted by Finance MinisterOnno Ruding, as saying unexpected rises in revenue wouldcompensate for excess spending of 3.1 billion guilders.    Ruding, putting this year's public sector borrowingrequirement 0.1 percentage point below last September's targetat 7.8 pct, criticised the excess spending but will not seekadditional spending cuts for 1987 because of the surprise boostin revenue, the report was quoted as saying.    Excess spending by the central government was put at 2.8billion guilders, while market factors accounted for another300 mln in unbudgetted expenditure.    But 1987 revenue was boosted by an unexpected 3.55 billion,including 1.9 billion in tax revenue and 500 mln guilders inincome from natural gas sales.    Ruding has said the 1987 excess spending will burden the1988 budget with an additional 1.9 billion and the cabinet hasalready pledged 1.2 billion in cuts to narrow the gap.    The cabinet is to discuss in coming months what furtherausterity measures will be needed next year to keep thegovernment on target for its 1990 aim of a public sectorborrowing requirement of no more than 5.25 pct of NNI.    Ruding has already met opposition from the Liberal andChristian-Democrat factions carrying the government majority inparliament to his calls for more spending cuts in the 1988budget to counter a slow-down in economic growth.
