Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumitasaid he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fallfurther.    He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament thatthe Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely withother major nations to stabilize exchange rates.    The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watchon exchange rate movements since last week, he said.    He said the dollar would not continue to fall because ofunderlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen.    Sumita said the currency market has been reacting tooverseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and theU.S. over semiconductors.    The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan fromexpanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economicrestructuring, he said. Reuter&#3;
