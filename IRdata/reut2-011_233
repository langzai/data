The report stated that Brazil already offered a hugenational market for the vehicle producers and offered potentialaccess to other large Latin American markets. "Development of afully integrated motor industry in Brazil may not be far away,"it said. Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford and Fiat are alloperating modern car plants in Brazil now, it added.  "Multinationals will want to consolidate and then expand inBrazil because of the enormous sourcing opportunities that sucha relatively low cost producer offers," the report said.

"At present Brazil issuffering from a debt crisis, rampant inflation and exchangerate fluctuations," the Intelligence Unit said.    "In spite of this, Brazil's resilience is maintained by thepotential created by its still under-exploited natural andhuman resources.
