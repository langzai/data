Eli Lilly and Co said its boardapproved a plan to buy up to 2.3 mln shares of its common stockto offset dilution from conversion of its 10-year notes issuedin connection with the acquisition of Hybritech Inc in March1986.    The non-transferable notes pay interest at an annual rateof 6.75 pct. The notes, which mature on March 31, 1996, becameconvertible into 2.3 mln shares of Lilly stock at 66.31 dlrs ashare beginning March 18, 1987.    Lilly said it will buy shares of stock from time to time inthe open market at prevailing prices or in privately negotiatedtransactions.    The newly announced purchase plan is in addition to itsexisting anti-dilutive stock repurchase programs. Under theseprograms, the company systematically buys back shares in theopen market to replace shares issued under its stock plan andacquisition earnout agreements.    Currently the only other potentially diluting instrumentsare the warrants that the company also issued in connectionwith the Hybritech acquisition.    Lilly issued 17.1 mln warrants with an expiration of March31, 1991. A warrant gives the holder the right to purchase oneshare of Lilly common at 75.98 dlrs. Since the acquisition,Lilly has repurchased 2.0 mln warrants, so there are currently15.1 mln outstanding.    The warrants are publicly traded on the New York StockExchange.    Because of the theoretical size of the dilution resultingfrom the outstanding warrants, warrants convertible notes,stock plan and acquisition earnout agreements, the company saidit will be required to report earnings per share on a fullydiluted basis beginnng with the first quarter of 1987.    At the end of February, Lilly had 139.6 mln sharesoutstanding. Reuter&#3;
