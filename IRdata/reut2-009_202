China's Premier Zhao Ziyang said thecountry must continue to reform its "irrational" price systemalthough this will mean price rises and cause living standardsfor some people to fall.    Zhao said China's price system is irrational due to"prolonged negligence of the law of value and due to the rigidand excessive state control."    "The prices of farm products, energy, raw and semi-finishedmaterials and other primary products have long been too low andmany products have long been in short supply," he said.    Price reforms are necessary to "establish a new vigoroussocialist economic structure, to effectively promote productionand commodity circulation and provide correct guidance toconsumption," Zhao added.    Reforms are bound to lead to a rise in the general pricelevel but will only be implemented after careful studies so asto keep the increase within the capacity of society and thepeople "to withstand the strain."     He said the general price level will rise in 1987 lessthan in 1986, with price increases of a very small number ofproducts. REUTER&#3;
