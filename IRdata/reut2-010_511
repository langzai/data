The Philippines has reached agreementwith its bank advisory committee on a debt-reschedulingagreement after four weeks of talks, a source close to thePhilippine delegation said.    No details were available and bankers were not available tocomment because meetings with the Philippine negotiators werestill in progress.    But a spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, whichchairs the 12-bank Philippine advisory committee, said a pressconference with finance minister Jaime Ongpin will begin at thebank's headquarters at 1430 EST/1930 GMT.    "There is an agreement," the source close to the Philippinedelegation said, adding that details would be announced at thepress conference.    Manila wants to reschedule about 3.6 billion dlrs of debtthat falls due between 1987 and 1992 and to obtain easier termson 5.8 billion dlrs of previously restructured debt.    The talks have dragged on because of the banks' reluctanceto accept interest payments partly in Philippine InvestmentNotes, PINs, instead of cash and because of Manila's insistenceon an interest rate margin close to the 5/8 pct spread overEurocurrency rates that it initially demanded.
