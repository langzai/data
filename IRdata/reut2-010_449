The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its bufferstock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market tostabilise prices, ICCO delegates said.    The date on which the new rules will take effect has notbeen decided but delegates said they expected them to come intoforce early next week, after which the buffer stock manager canbegin buying or selling cocoa.    Since prices are below the "may-buy" level of 1,655 SpecialDrawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager islikely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said.    Delegates and traders said they expected the manager,Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeksof the pact coming into force.    The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins orthe second hand market on an offer system, not by means of aposted price as in the previous cocoa accord.    The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set ofdifferentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghanacocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa.    Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will belimited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one dayshould be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate andforward positions.    The council meeting, which is expected to conclude twoweeks of sessions involving various working groups and thecouncil itself, was continuing, the delegates said.    The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20during a previous meeting of the council which was unable toagree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations. REUTER&#3;
