Ron Miller, vice president for UAW local 594, saidnegotiations resumed at 1000 EST, as expected.    Miller said the two sides seemed to be getting closer to anagreement when the union's noon deadline yesterday was reached.    He said he hoped an accord could be reached by Monday.    Miller said negotiators for the union, which represents9,000 workers at Pontiac, and General Motors have still notbeen able to agree on the main issue--the company's use ofnon-UAW labor for some jobs.
