Oil price firmness, a sharp stock pricefall and widespread fear that the dollar has much more room todecline sent bond prices tumbling, dealers said.    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1-3/32 pointsto close at 95-1/32 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basispoints from Monday and was 1987's highest closing yield.    "Investors threw in the towel today. The long bond seemsheaded for eight pct within the next few days," a trader said.That would correspond to a price of about 94-3/8.    Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points.Notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.    Bond traders said the main negative is recent instabilityof the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted centralbank support will not prevent a further drop in the dollar. Reuter&#3;
