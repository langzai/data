American Telephone and Telegraph Co saidthe Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) approved its 4.1mln dlr rate restructuring proposal to reduce intrastate longdistance rates by about 4.4 pct.    ATT said it will file new prices at the PSC in August tomeet a Sept. 1 effective date set by the commission.    The telephone company said it asked the PSC on Nov. 7 forpermission to increase its prices for intrastate private lineservices, used mainly by large business customers, which ATTsaid were priced below its access costs.    "Private line service has been grossly underpriced since1984, and, therefore, it has been subsidized by all longdistance users," Terry Hobbs, assistant vice president said.    "As a result of today's PSC decision to allow our privateline service prices to cover their access costs, thesesubsidies will end and we'll be able to reduce basic longdistance rates for everyone," he added.
