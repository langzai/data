Barbados is making its annual trip tothe international capital markets a bit earlier this year andhas mandated Barclays Bank Plc to arrange a 25 mln stgrevolving credit, Barclays said.    The financing will be for seven years, with four yearsgrace, and will allow the borrower to make drawings in U.S.Dollars. The credit will be transferable and carry interest at1-1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate. There is acommitment fee of 1/2 pct.    Banks are being invited to join at four mln stg for 50basis points and at 2.5 mln stg for 40 basis points.    The terms represent an improvement over those obtained lastyear, when Barbados tapped the market for a 25 mln dlrtransferable loan facility, which carried the same maturity buthad interest at 1-1/4 pct over Libor. The facility wassubsequently increased to 40 mln dlrs.    However, the loan was not signed until November 5, andbankers said that this year Barbados wanted to have thefinancing in place early to give it greater flexibility indrawing the funds over the course of the year.    Last year Barbados boosted its capital market borrowingswith a small private yen placement in the Japanese market.    At the signing of the 40 mln dlr facility, Winston Cox,advisor to the Central Bank of Barbados, said he was looking tomake greater use of the international capital markets to reducethe country's dependence on multi-national orgainsations.    However, bankers believe this will be the country's onlymajor financing for this year, although another small privateplacement in Japan could be arranged later in the year. REUTER&#3;
