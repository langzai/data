Japanese car makers will curb theirexports to the European Community (EC) following an unofficialdirective from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry(MITI), automobile industry sources said.    Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely tobe at most unchanged from last year's 1.10 mln units and mayeven fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economicgrowth and increasing trade friction.    Last week, MITI vice minister for international affairsMakoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers toexercise prudence in exporting to Europe.    Japanese car makers boosted exports to the EC in January tobuild up depleted vehicle inventories, industry sources said.    Japan's vehicle exports to Europe in January rose 38 pctfrom a year earlier to 174,133 units.    In December, exports fell 70.4 pct year-on-year as makerscurbed shipments to meet an earlier directive from MITI tolimit 1986 exports, they said. REUTER&#3;
