Japan's policy of self-sufficiency inrice is an example of extreme protectionism, visiting U.S.Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference.    He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japanhad a large export balance, not just with the U.S. But withother countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pctself-sufficient in one product.    Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agricultureminister Mutsuki Kato, Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked fortotal liberalisation of the rice market in Japan.    Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.    "We want to have some access in the rice market," he said.    He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutterwere disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He toldreporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to opennegotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japanon rice.    Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of riceself-sufficiency.    Asked what the next U.S. Step would be on the rice issue,Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the U.S. Riceindustry would do.    Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or Augustthis year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by theU.S. Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in themeantime.    U.S. Rice industry officials have indicated they wouldconsider filing another complaint against the Japan rice importban. REUTER&#3;
