The White House Economic PolicyCouncil decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan forviolations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement,industry sources said.    They would give no details, noting that the White House hadnot commented on the decision. The administration has beenunder pressure to retaliate.    There was no immediate announcement on the council'sdecision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the seniorpolicy group's move on curbs reflected growing Americanfrustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices.    U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act onthe recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aideson the foreign policy implications of retaliation.    The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for alast try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reachedlast July governing trade in semiconductors.    Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumpingsemiconductors in world markets and to open its own market toU.S.-made semiconductors.    In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumpingduties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.    The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S.Market but has continued in third countries, and that theJapanese market remains closed.    The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimouscall by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanesehigh technology products containing semiconductors.    A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductorindustry and from its chief trade union.    U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japanwould involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such astelevisions, video cassette recorders and computers. REUTER&#3;
