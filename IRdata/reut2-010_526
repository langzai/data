The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) council agreed standard price differentials fordifferent origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buyingand selling procedure, consumer delegates said.    The buffer stock manager will accept offers for differentorigin cocoas according to a sliding scale of pricedifferentials, under which Ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137stg premium to Malaysian.    Thus, if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based ona Malaysian price of 1,200 stg a tonne, he would accept Ghanaoffers up to 1,337 stg.    Differentials were fixed as follows, Country       Differential stg/tonne Malaysia           0 Brazil            55 Ivory Coast       67 Cameroun          77 Nigeria          120 Togo             130 Ghana            137    Nigeria's differential is on "landed weight" terms. Shippingweight terms will be accepted at a 15 stg discount to thisrate. Reuter&#3;
