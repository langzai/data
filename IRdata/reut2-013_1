Compaq Computer Corp, IBM's chiefrival in the personal computer market, scored a big gain onWall Street today. Compaq's stock rose 1-3/8 to 32-1/4 onvolume of 1.3 mln shares.    "The rationale for the move," one trader said, "is that thedamage from the IBM announcement yesterday was less thanexpected." He said Compaq's stock had been under pressurerecently because of anticipation of IBM's unveiling of a newline of personal computers.    International Business Machines &lt;IBM> introduced four newpersonal computers and more than 100 new peripheral products.But analysts said the new computers, though they do contain alot of proprietary concepts, will not be as hard to copy assome other PC makers had feared.    "The long range issue here is who wins and who loses in thePC business, and that issue was not resolved yesterday and isunlikely to be decided any time soon," analyst Mark Stahlman ofSanford C. Bernstein and Co said.    Stahlman reaffirmed his recommendation of Compaq and AppleComputer Inc &lt;AAPL>.    Stahlman said "The critical investment question now is whowill have a pickup in sales in the near term. We expect to seea strong demand setting for PCs for the rest of this year, andthat will boost the revenues for all of the major PC vendors."    "The first quarter was the strongest PC sales period onrecord for Compaq, Apple and IBM," Stahlman said, "and I don'tthink the IBM announcement is going to change that trend soon."    "In anticipating the IBM announcement, Compaq has madepricing adjustments necessary to compete for its immediatepurposes," he said. Reuter&#3;
