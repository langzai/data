&lt;Toronto Sun Publishing Corp> said itwas examining an idea for a new tabloid newspaper in Britainafter being being approached about the concept by a person inEngland it declined to indentify.    "We were talking to this individual and offered to help himin effect formulate his concept and that is about as far as ithas gone," Toronto Sun Publishing vice-president of financeBruce Jackson said in reply to a query.    "We have not decided anything," Jackson added. "It has notbeen brought to the board of directors for any kind of approvalor heavy discussion."    Jackson said that Toronto Sun recently produced a dummynewspaper for the individual to use in testing possible Britishmarket reaction. Toronto Sun publishes tabloids in Toronto,Edmonton and Calgary, Alberta and the Houston Post.    Asked about possible financial or editorial support byToronto Sun, Jackson replied: "It is far too premature todiscuss anything like that." He said further developments wereunlikely to unfold for "at least a month."    Jackson described the British tabloid market as "verycompetitive, but it is a very large market as well. It mostlikely doesn't take a large market share to be profitable thereas long as you find the right niche."    He said Toronto Sun is approached almost every month aboutideas for starting newspapers, mostly in North America, "as theToronto Sun is known to be a newspaper group that has startedpapers.    "Unfortunately, this one leaked out and it probablyattracted a little more attention than it really deserves atthis point," Jackson said.    Toronto Sun recently dropped plans to start a secondEnglish language newspaper in Montreal, citing a study thatindicated the lack of a sufficient advertising base for such apaper. Reuter&#3;
