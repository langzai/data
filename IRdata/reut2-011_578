The U.S. Agriculture Department saidit has extended until April 17 the date by which AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation county offices must determineeligibility of individuals or other entities for payments under1987 farm programs.    Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and RicePrice Support Division, said the decision meant farmers haveuntil April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating howmany persons would be involved in their farming operations.    Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1from March 1, Sitter said.    ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement thatthe extension was necessary because of heavy workloads atcounty ASCS offices.    Hertz said ASCS county officials "have had to make a largenumber of eligibility determinations for individuals and otherentities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparationfor imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap."    "These offices already had a very heavy workload due to thelarge number of applications for both the 1987 farm programsand the Conservation Reserve Program," Hertz said. Reuter&#3;
