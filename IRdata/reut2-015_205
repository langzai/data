Controversial plans to payWestern Europe's surplus-producing farmers generous cash grantsto leave the land ran into problems at today's weekly meetingof the European Community (EC) Commission, officials said.    They said the 17-member Commission, which effectively runsthe Community on a day-to-day basis, appeared divided over theproposals which some people argue could lead to nationalcapitals having too much say in EC farm policies.    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen is proposing payingfarmers as much as 2,800 dlrs a year over five years to leavethe land. EC member states would be permitted to top uppayments to the poorest farmers to 80 pct of the averagenational farm income.    The package would also include an early retirement scheme,details of which have yet to be unveiled.    Andriessen's aim is to make a restrictive price policy --the centre-piece of a current battle to curb unwanted foodproduction -- more acceptable to countries with large farmingcommunities.    With two-thirds of the EC's entire 39 billion dlr budgetswallowed up by EC farm supports, he argues that in thelong-run the payments would lead to considerable savings. Reuter&#3;
