Thai coffee exporters said they hopedthe International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimposeexport quotas even though this may lead to a further slump inworld prices.    Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai CoffeeExporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtainedlittle benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented onlyabout 30 pct of its total annual exports.    Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue ifthere are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members whooffer higher prices than non-members, he said.    The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnesof coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.    Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 theprevious year.    However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thaigovernment supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposedICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.    Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the CommercialEconomics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas wouldencourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market,further depressing prices.    He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantialamount of coffee this month without such restrictions. REUTER&#3;
