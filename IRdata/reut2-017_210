President Reagan is expected to tellPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May beable to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June,the New York Times said.    The newspaper, quoting administration officials, said thatunder such a scenario the President would announce just beforethe June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hopedto lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end ofthe month. Japan, for its part, would have to show that it hadstopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access inJapan for U.S. Chip producers.    The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mlndlrs worth of Japanese color television sets, motorised toolsand personal computers on April 17.    Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when hearrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be theimmediate lifting of the tariffs.    But with Congress planning further trade reprisals againstJapanese trade policies, the end-of-June timeframe is seen asthe best Reagan can offer, the Times said. It said some verbalformulation was expected to be found in a communique that wouldallow Nakasone to claim at least a modest victory. REUTER&#3;
