GenCorp Inc said the decision byGeneral Partners, comprised of AFG Industries and Wagner andBrown, to end its hostile offer for the company supports itsbelief that the buy back offer it announced yesterday was a"financially superior alternative."    GenCorp said it would annouce details of its plans to buyback 54 pct of its stock for 1.6 billion dlrs, or 130 dlrs ashare, later this week. GenCorp's buy back was made to fend offthe hostile 2.3 billion dlr, 100-dlr-a-share, tender offer byAFG and Wagner and Brown.    Earlier today AFG and Wagner and Brown said that withoutthe benefit of additional information available to GenCorp'smanagement, it cannot compete economically with GenCorp'sproposal.    The group said it is ending its tender offer for GenCorpand promptly return to tendering shareholders all sharestendered pursuant to its offer.    The group owns 9.8 pct, or 2,180,608 shares, of GenCorp'soutstanding shares. Reuter&#3;
