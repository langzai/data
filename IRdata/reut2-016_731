The European Community (EC) is readyto take measures to ensure that Japanese exports expected to beeffectively excluded from the U.S. Market from today are notdiverted to the EC, a spokesman said.    President Reagan is expected to announce later today theimposition of 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanesegoods ranging from computers and television sets to power toolsand photographic film.    The spokesman for the EC executive Commission saidrepresentatives of member states last Friday agreed a series ofmeasures to prevent Tokyo deflecting exports to the EC.    The spokesman declined to detail the measures, saying theywere technical, and the Commission would decide their precisecontent depending on the exact details of the measuresannounced by Reagan.    The EC fears Tokyo will step up exports to it of a range ofproducts including calculating machines, measuring instruments,small televisions, tapes and some machine tools as a result ofthe U.S. Measures.    But the spokesman said there was thought to be ample timeto put the countermeasures in place after the Easter holiday.    He noted the probable outline of Reagan's announcement andits date have been known for some time.    The Japanese manufacturers of goods likely to be affectedby the announcement are thought to have been stepping up theirexports to the United States in recent weeks in order to beatthe April 17 deadline, he noted.    They were therefore unlikely to have stocks available forexport to the EC immediately, he said. REUTER&#3;
