Denmark, Norway and Sweden have jointlyproposed deregulating air fares between Scandinavia and theU.S. In exchange for greater access to the domestic U.S.Airline market, Norwegian officials said.    The proposal, handed to federal aviation authorities inWashington by a delegation from the three countries' transportministries, was seen in the industry as a major concession todemands by U.S. Airlines to deregulate air fares toScandinavia.    The scheme in return requests the &lt;Scandinavian AirlinesSystem>, owned by Sweden, Denmark and Norway's governments, beallowed to compete freely and fairly in the U.S. Market.    SAS, the only Scandinavian airline flying transatlanticroutes to the U.S., Is currently allowed to land at only fourU.S. Cities and has no commercial routes within the U.S.    SAS has long held that regulations allowing U.S. Airlines'connecting flights from international to regional airportswithin Scandinavia have given these companies an advantagedenied to SAS in the United States.    Initial U.S. Reaction to the proposal has been positive,officials said. Industry sources added that if approved, thescheme would likely lower air fares dramatically betweenScandinavia and the U.S. REUTER&#3;
