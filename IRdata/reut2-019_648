Weekend rain over the Western Corn Beltbrought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlierthis month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcomemoisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-WeatherInc.    "There is going to be more rain for the next two, threedays," he said. "We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal toabove normal moisture this week."    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southernMinnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in easternNebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend butwere receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio withthudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.    "Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, apretty good rain," Mohler said.    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparkingan early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board ofTrade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt isexpected to move over the central Midwest, then move northlater in the week. That could bring new rain patterns acrossthe Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions asearly-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stagein early July, he said. Reuter&#3;
