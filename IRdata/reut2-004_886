Fairchild Industries Inc saidit will close the Fairchild Republic plant at Farmingdale thisyear, and sell it next year, after agreeing with the U.S. AirForce to terminate the T-46A trainer aircraft program.    John Sanford, the Fairchild Republic unit's president andvice president of the corporation, said Reublic will fulfillits remaining current obligations, but will cease work on theT-46A immediately.    Fairchild said the unit has already delivered two protoypeand one production T-46A.    Sanford said lack of additional Air Force funding for thetrainer due to budget constraints prompted the terminationagreement.    Sanford added that without the T-46A or business to replacethe work, Fairchild was forced to close the plant.    Fairchild said it expects to retain about 200 engineers andtechnicians at a small operation to be set up in 1987 on LongIsland to continue providing technical support for the AirForce's A-10 aircraft.    Fairchild added that its Fairchild Composites/BondingCenter, formerly a part of the Fairchild Republic operation,will become an independent operation.    Paul Wright, Fairchild president and chief operatingofficer, said, "With the settlement of the T-46A issue we haveput behind us the last of two problem aircraft programs thatcaused the company heavy losses over the past two years."    Wright added that the company can now move forward with itsrestructuring to emphasize on growth areas in aerospace,communications, electronics and its commercial and industrialbusinesses.    Earlier, Fairchild reported losses from continuingoperations in 1986's 4th qtr of 3.2 mln dlrs, or 44 cts ashare.    This compares with a operating profit of two mln dlrs, or aloss of eight cts a share, after subtracting the provisions forpreferred shares, in 1985's fourth quarter.    Fairchild reported 1986 operating net of 7.6 mln dlrs, or aloss of 34 cts a share, after provisions for preferred shares,versus a loss of 283,000 dlrs, or 93 cts a share, in 1985. Reuter&#3;
